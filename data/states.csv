Our wildlife biologists apply methods that are used all over the world with positive results. To denigrate their professional efforts is to be totally out of touch with reality. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Devon Craig: A response to a commentary on Vermont wildlife .","Dear Editor,
It’s interesting that Brenna Galdenzi’s opinion piece starts off with a Walt Disneyesque description of animal behaviors. 
They are not humans and should not be treated as such. Every second of every day, a bear kills a deer, a coyote kills a woodchuck, a hawk kills a chipmunk. They don’t talk with each other. 
She notes that our history of hunting is not in tune with the times and that our traditions are no longer viable. I guess she forgets about the hunting, fishing and trapping communities self-regulating that everyone — herself included — benefits from. 
I am referencing the billions of dollars made available through taxation of which the hunting and fishing communities levied upon themselves have paid for untold millions of acres of lands for wildlife to live in — dollars in the amounts of which non-consumers of wildlife will never equal or exceed. But they, too, receive the benefits of our largess.
Those dollars have supported our country’s fish and wildlife departments for many decades, allowing the scientific results of wildlife biologists’ studies to benefit viable numbers of wild animals. To denigrate their professional efforts is to be totally out of touch with reality. 
Wildlife management is a work in progress. With human influence in our land becoming greater every day, it is now, more than ever, the time to use science to solve problems — not simple emotions.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-10 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,What if the government gave you public money to spend at Disneyland?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/10/public-money-school-choice-disney/,"Column: Would you like some public funds to take your family on vacation to Disneyland? Under the logic of some politicians who support ""school choice,"" it's not out of the realm of possibility.","A new grassroots movement is developing that would allow public money to follow what we’ll call the “recreator,” or a person who participates in recreational activity.
It makes sense. Why should a person be forced to provide his or her hard-earned money to support local and state park systems if they are not using them?
Would you like to take your kids to Disneyland, but you’re worried about how much it will cost your family? That’s OK, the government can give you back some of the tax money you paid to keep your town’s public parks open and subsidize your trip. You don’t use those local parks much anyways, and you could argue you’d personally get more out of the Disney trip.
Or, instead of paying for the parks with your tax money, take it to help purchase a gym membership or in-home exercise equipment — maybe even a backyard swing set. Instead of paying for public libraries, your tax funds could be used to purchase the books you want to read.
These ideas, of course, should read as extremely unserious. As much as we may like to pay lower taxes or have the public subsidize our vacations and lifestyle habits, most would agree a family trip to Disneyland or these other expenses would be an egregious use of money intended to improve our communities.
But these exact ideas are being increasingly touted by state leaders as part of the argument used by those supporting vouchers or even tax credits to provide public funds to allow students to attend private schools.
They argue that the tax dollars intended to boost public school should instead be spent by the parents of the students and not the government. After all, it’s their money. The parents of students should be able to use those funds to educate their children anyway they see fit.
To go a step further, the “school choice supporters,” as they call themselves, also contend that there should be no accountability for the schools or other entities receiving those education dollars. Trust in the parents is apparently the only accountability that the government needs.
Never mind the wild possible scenarios that could play out. Let’s say parents get mad because their child’s grades are slipping. The parents with a voucher to a private school tell the administrators they are transferring little Johnnie unless little Johnnie makes certain grades. The easy solution for the school administrators could be to give little Johnnie that grade demanded by the parents so that the school can continue to collect the public education dollars.
This “parents know best” argument neglects the important fact that there are many taxpayers who are paying to support the public schools who have no children. Taking this argument to the extreme: perhaps people who do not have school-age children should be able to keep their funds rather than funding schools where they have no personal connection.
That counter argument, of course, is also ridiculous and ignores the premise that was established at our nation’s founding. Americans don’t pay taxes for individual purposes. They pay taxes for the common or societal good.
The primary goal of taxes is to ensure a better school system not just for one student, but for the general public.
The goal of taxes is not to provide a good park in your neighborhood or a smoothly paved road in front of your own house — though that does seem to be the goal of some Mississippi lawmakers recently — but to provide good, safe public spaces and an adequate transportation system for all of us.
Granted, those goals are not always achieved, especially in many communities across Mississippi. But if there is no tax money to pay for public schools, public parks, public libraries, public law enforcement, we all suffer. Better public schools in particular can only build a better community, a better economy and a better state.
People want to live in areas where there are good schools, good parks, good libraries, good transportation systems and other public services.
If we pull tax revenue out of the coffers they were intended to support, what are we left with? It’s worth considering what our public school system — and our communities in the present and future — would look like with even fewer public resources.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08103448/AP24108573586959.jpg,,,2025-08-10 07:56:12.200082

Listen to the full interview.
WATERBURY— Nick Deml, Vermont’s outgoing corrections commissioner, wants the public to know that more and more is being expected of Vermont’s prisons, both from federal immigration authorities and the state’s human services landscape. 
“Today, the expectation is that the corrections agency does everything,” he told VTDigger in a wide-ranging interview this week. “That’s a good thing for the most part, but we’re expected to provide education, we’re expected to provide substance use treatment, we’re expected to provide the community standard of health care.” 
Deml will will step down Aug. 15 after almost four years leading Vermont’s prison system

Former Burlington Police Department Chief Jon Murad will take the reins, overseeing the state’s six detention facilities, more than 900 employees and almost 1,600 incarcerated individuals.  
In an interview with VTDigger, Deml discussed the learning curve inherent in taking over the department as an outsider without previous prison experience. He detailed the challenges facing corrections, like improving working conditions in order to retain security staff and working with a population of incarcerated individuals in need of more care than they were prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Deml also addressed some of the more public struggles the Department of Corrections has faced, from replacing the state’s ailing women’s prison, Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, to the increasing burden of working with federal immigration authorities. 
After leaving the department, Deml said he plans to begin consulting on projects related to corrections as well as his past work in national security. He did not rule out a return to government work, but did swat away rumors of a run for office. 

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
VTDigger: Why did you take this job?
Nick Deml: It’s an interesting question, because when I took the job — before and even since — people say ‘this has got to be the hardest job in state government,’ or maybe the Department for Children and Families Commissioner, which I actually think is probably harder.
It can be kind of thankless. There’s a couple of things that motivated me to do the job. One, I wanted to work in Vermont. (Two), I wanted to stay in government and public service, and I think you’d be hard pressed to find another role in Vermont that can have the impact that you can have as the commissioner of Corrections. The number of lives you touch, either people in your custody, people in the community that you’re serving. 
VTD: What do you think you didn’t understand about the job going in? 
ND: I didn’t come from a corrections background, and so there was certainly a learning curve on the front end, as there would be with any job, particularly a job of this scope and scale. But I think I underappreciated the complexity of corrections. I think initially I didn’t understand the scale or scope of the workforce crisis, the staffing crisis that we were experiencing. 
And then I think we all were on a learning curve, but by myself chiefly among us, to understand how much we changed during the pandemic, and particularly looking at our incarcerated population. I think we expected health trends to rebound and we’d go back to kind of 2019 levels of everything. And that was not the case. In fact, coming out of the pandemic, the folks that were coming into our system in particular were much sicker than they were in 2019, and that hasn’t abated. 
VTD: Do you think being an outsider made it more challenging to deal with the rank and file and have some of those workforce conversations with the union?
ND: I don’t think it made it harder to talk to our folks on the line. What I heard when I went out, especially initially, for those first, you know, year, 18 months, every time I went to a facility and met with folks, they would say, ‘It’s been a long time since we’ve seen a commissioner. I’ve not met a commissioner before.’ 
That opportunity to connect with them at their worksite, where they’re working, where they’re doing the mission, I think that is what enabled me to connect with our workforce really closely. And I think that wouldn’t matter if I was a career corrections officer or somebody off the street. You need to find ways to connect to those folks, and they’re yearning for that. They’re the folks on the ground doing the work every day, and we drifted a little bit, I think, from them. And so our mission over the last four years was really to build back that trust with our workforce, show them that we care. And I think we did that.
As it relates to the union, I think it cuts both ways. On the one hand, I don’t think they really knew what to do with me, because I wasn’t the commissioner they were used to. And on the other hand, I think they didn’t give — I don’t know, ‘respect’ is too strong of a word — but I don’t think that they were willing to engage me the way they would have somebody they’d known for a long time.
VTD: The workforce crisis has gotten better but hasn’t completely abated. There’s still mandatory overtime. (Officers are sometimes required to work 16-hour shifts.) What has worked, and what hasn’t worked?
ND: Vermont has a workforce crisis writ large. We’re an aging state. We have a decreasing number of working-age adults, and so there’s just fewer and fewer people available to do the work. 
Then you bring that down to corrections. Corrections nationally is having this staffing crisis pretty much everywhere in the country. We were at a high vacancy rate in our security ranks of 32% vacant. Today, some of the corrections agencies around the country are over 50%. 
We’re down now to 15%, and that’s great, but there’s mandatory overtime. The work-life balance isn’t there yet. Folks are stressed, it’s a tough job on its best day, and then you add the extra hours in, and it becomes very, very difficult. 
So what’s worked? I mean, we took the opportunity early in my tenure, but I think about a year into my tenure, to really go out and do focus groups, do surveying, meet with staff in the facilities to talk about, what are the pain points for them? Why would you continue working here? Why would you consider leaving? Instead of trying to decipher what we thought the problems were, we got really salient, really fairly consistent results across the entire system. And that was, ‘I’m not getting enough time away from the facilities. Work life balance isn’t there. The facilities are hard places to work. I’m not getting the supervision I’m seeking.’ 
What we didn’t hear is, ‘I don’t get paid enough.’ So it’s really for me, when we started to diagnose the workforce challenges, it’s about the experience of staff working in the system, and if we can improve that experience, we’re more likely to keep folks. Now, we did increase pay. We put more than $30 million into additional compensation over the last three years for correctional staff. We’ve added other benefits. We have a great partnership with the Community College of Vermont providing free community college education to staff. Until we can materially change the experience of a correctional officer on a day-to-day basis, going to work and having work-life balance, we’re going to continue to suffer here. 
VTD: To change staff’s experience, I imagine you need to change the facilities themselves — what they look like. There’s been an ongoing struggle to build a new women’s prison. Are we as a state still capable of building a new human services property, of siting a new facility?
ND: I mean, I hope so. At the end of the day, one of the primary functions of a state government is to provide human services. If we are going to continue to face very difficult situations trying to build new human services facilities, then the state won’t be able to deliver on its mandate. 
But I do think there’s hope. I think that we will build a new women’s prison. I think it will be a significantly different experience at that facility than hopefully any facility in the country, but certainly any facility that Vermont has ever had. 
But we’re not going to replace all the men’s facilities, certainly not in the next short period of time. I think it’ll be decades before we do that. So what do we do with the facilities we have? And that’s where we’ve tried to focus in, to improve the staff experience, by creating spaces that are dedicated to staff so they can decompress, recoup, take breaks. We’ve tried to change paint schemes and things like that just to soften the facilities. And we advocated very strongly for HVAC systems for our correctional facilities. So we’re on a multi-year project to put air conditioning throughout the system. 
VTD: You’ve described the communication breakdown or a stalemate with the town of Essex in trying to build a new women’s prison. What can change in that process? Does the state need to throw its weight around more? How does this get done? 
ND: I think Vermont as a community really leans into collaboration and partnership, and so I think that’s the space where I hope we can make the most ground up.
I understand folks don’t want the concept of a prison in their backyard, and I appreciate that. And yet, I think if you talk to the neighbors around the Chittenden facility, the current women’s facility in Vermont, they would say, ‘We like having them as our neighbors.’ I know that because we’ve talked to them, and that’s what they say. The police chief, the fire chief, local businesses have appreciated that facility being there. We’ve been good neighbors to them. They’ve been good neighbors to us. And it is part of our community, whether people want to acknowledge that or not.
I think the situation in Essex will get better. We’re trying to build a complicated human services facility in a community that hasn’t had that in the past, and so, you know, they’re going through iterations too, and there’s going to be some growing pains. But I have confidence that the town leadership will continue to advance this project. We don’t want to get to a place where the state is trying to exert control, because that’s not going to get us the best outcomes. 
VTD: Compared to commissioners past, you’ve been a more ubiquitous face. People see you on the news. Your department has taken a different media strategy than others. What’s the thinking behind that approach? 
ND: I’m a firm believer in transparent government. We’re here to serve our communities, and to do that effectively, communities need to see us and what we’re doing.
I do think we’ve really benefited from transparency. It’s helped us to re-establish credibility where it was lost. It’s helped us to elevate the work. I mean, we have almost 1,000 staff in the Department of Corrections, and they’re public servants. They’re doing really hard work every day. And I think in general, people either don’t think about it or don’t respect the profession. And I wanted to change that as part of my work here.
VTD: Do you want to run for political office?
ND: I’ve been getting this question a lot lately. I have no interest in running for office. You know, the interesting thing about that, I mean, there’s nothing about running for office that is appealing to me. But doing these jobs, having the opportunity to serve the public and being able to do the work is what’s appealing. And so, you strip the politics away from it, the government work is, I think, the important part.
VTD: It seems like in the last couple of years, the governor and his team have pushed for what might be labeled ‘tougher on crime’ policies (like a public safety package in 2025 and new crimes targeting drugs and retail theft in 2024). Your department has pushed for more progressive approaches to problems like substance use. Do you feel like you’ve been working at cross purposes?
ND: I mean, I don’t think so. You’re right, the corrections agency doesn’t get to decide who comes to us. So our job, our mandate, is to receive whoever is sent there and take care of them as best we can. So that’s care, food service, health. And helping folks go back to the community to be successful. 
And while we’re doing that, certainly I think the communities that I’ve heard from are really struggling to adapt to the substance use crisis that’s been kind of plaguing Vermont over the last several years. These kind of low-level repeat crimes over and over again — what do you do with somebody like that? And so that public policy debate has been going on, but it’s really outside the scope of the department. Our job is to take care of the folks when they come to us, and I think we’ve done a good job with that. 
We see population changes over time. I think we’re on a bit of an upswing right now, and I don’t exactly know what the cause of that is, but our job is to try to figure out, how do we provide for these folks in our custody as best we can for the period they’re with us. 
VTD: At the beginning of your tenure, there was a string of deaths, particularly at Southern State, a rate of deaths that data would indicate outpaces the national average. With that, there’s been a lot of attention put on the health services provided in Vermont’s prisons and the various contractors that provide those services. Is prison health care broken, and what can make it better?
ND: Yeah, I think prison health care is definitely in a tough spot. I hope it’s not broken, because I do think that there are ways that it can improve. 
States are in a difficult place. There’s kind of three general models for this. You have a private, contracted health service, that’s what we do in Vermont. You have an in-state, in-government service that’s provided. That would be like if the Department of Corrections hired nurses, doctors, and they would be department staff. Vermont used that model about 20 years ago. And then a third, you have a partnership with a hospital system in your state. Often those are tied to universities, but not always. 
A state like Vermont, I think, suffers additionally from its size, in that we can’t create economies of scale in the way that a state like Texas can, for example. So Texas has its own hospital system within the correction system, massive multiple actual physical hospitals that they can utilize. They’re all corrections patients. I mean, we couldn’t afford something like that here. 
And that’s the model that we used 20 years ago. I wasn’t in the space 20 years ago, but talking to colleagues who were, including the defender general and others, they would say that wasn’t better than what we have now. 
VTD: Do you think an improved system would have prevented some of these deaths?
ND: I think it’s pretty difficult to say. 
We looked at each individual death that occurred in our system in the last four years. We did that. There’s also multiple other investigations that take place under state law. And then we also tried to look at trending analysis. 
Our numbers are pretty small, so it’s hard to extrapolate trends out of the small numbers. But there weren’t things that were immediately apparent that were major consistencies between the deaths. That’s tough for us, because we want to solve the issue, but if there isn’t a consistent issue to solve, it makes it more difficult.
I’ve been happy — happy may not the right word — but happy that the deaths by suicide numbers have definitely gone down. That’s a space where I do think there’s different ways for us to intervene and try to pick up on signs earlier, do everything that we can to prevent that outcome from happening. And I think we’ve taken steps to do that, and hopefully that continues.
That leaves us with folks who are dying of some type of medical issue or substance use, and those are more difficult to manage and intervene in. That’s, I think, where we want to focus.
VTD: What are the biggest challenges facing your successor?
ND: He’s going to continue to have to grapple with the workforce challenge. That’s the biggest existential threat to the success of corrections agencies across the country.
He’s going to have a population that is continuing to age, continuing to present with very complicated medical issues. And you know, in Vermont, we have a unified system, so we have the sentenced population and the detained population. That detained population is presenting to us much sicker than they ever have in our history. And that’s really challenging. 
If you get somebody on a Friday night brought in by law enforcement, and an hour later they’re overdosing and need to go to an emergency room, that puts a corrections system in a really complicated place.
VTD: Have you seen eye-to-eye with Gov. Phil Scott on the department’s work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and border patrol?
ND: That is a really complicated issue
Vermont’s always had a relationship with ICE, or at least for a long time. Historically, it was folks who were coming across the border allegedly without authorization to do so, and they were detained by border patrol, brought to us temporarily because there’s no other detention space in the state, and then they’d be moved on and adjudicated through whatever federal immigration process existed. 
That’s changed a little bit, as we testified to recently. There’s folks being brought from other states and other spaces. It’s not just those folks who are doing the illegal border crossings. We’re just at the beginning of unpacking what this means.
But certainly I see eye-to-eye with the governor on — our obligation is to help people that are coming to our system. And I can affirm to the governor that if somebody comes to our correctional system, they will have access to the courts, they will have access to health care, they will have access to food, and we will try to provide them with any of the needs that they have in our system. 
VTD: Did any of these challenges or frustrations about collaborating with federal immigration authorities influence your decision to leave the department?
ND: No. Certainly there’s been a lot more work with ICE in the last six months. But no, my decision predated that and I was pretty confident that this was roughly the timeline I was going to be on when I was going to leave.
VTD: Was it your decision to leave?
ND: Yeah.
VTD: What are you most proud of from these years?
ND: Philosophically, we reoriented this department. Our goal, and hopefully we’ve accomplished this, was to reorient this department to the people it’s supposed to be serving. So on the one side, that’s our staff. They deserve to have a department that’s invested in them, who care about them, who want them to have meaningful careers with lots of impact, mission focused, and we know that this job extends beyond the walls of our facilities, and we need to take care of them outside of there, too. These are really, really tough jobs, 
And we have people in our care and custody that are counting on us to keep them safe, keep them fed and healthy, and take care of medical issues for them. And we, I think, reoriented the department to that work as well. In particular on the health side. That was the greatest body of work where we could make a huge impact and continue to improve on that system. 
And so we redesigned our health system. We’re about to onboard our first ever manager over nutrition to really target, How do we improve people’s health by giving them good food? Can we locally source food? Can we grow our own food so that it is the best food available for the population? I mean, just a year or so ago, we went to fluid milk across our system in partnership with the Agriculture Agency here in Vermont, and we’re using local Vermont and upstate New York milk to provide to our population. 
It’s a basic premise, but if folks are healthier when they leave, they’re more likely to be successful when they go to the community. And so it’s good for public safety, it’s good for the state and it’s just simply the right thing to do. 
VTD: What do people not understand about the Department of Corrections? And what do people maybe even within the Vermont Agency of Human Services not understand about the Department of Corrections? 
ND: One thing that we’ve been trying to highlight to folks is — as other systems across the state, across the country aren’t able to serve folks, as we have a lack of available medical care for folks, or mental health care, substance use treatment — what happens is those folks all end up kind of at the end of the line. The end of the line is either they’re unhoused, they’re in an emergency department, or they’re in a correctional facility, and often they’re cycling between the three.
I think the other thing, though, particularly in Vermont, but other places too, more and more is expected of the corrections system. Thirty years ago, largely the expectation was that somebody would be incarcerated for a period of time. You’d keep them safe, you’d stop them from fighting, and then you’d provide health care and food service and those things. And then when they got out, they got out.
Today, the expectation is that the corrections agency does everything for that person. And I think that’s a good thing for the most part, but we’re expected to provide education, we’re expected to provide substance use treatment, we’re expected to provide the community standard of health care. And all of that is good, but more and more is layered on top of the corrections agency as the one-stop-shop that can do all of that work while we have a staffing crisis, while there’s pressure for us to close facilities and decarcerate, and new resources aren’t added in. 
Frankly, corrections agencies can’t be good at everything and shouldn’t be good at everything. Our approach to that was to turn to community partners and try to bring more folks into our facilities to help. But I do think that that is kind of an untenable position that corrections agencies are being put in, and particularly as other community support systems collapse or recede from their ability to provide services.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


–  Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

This wasn’t just a technical decision. This was a political decision — and a moral one.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Rebecca Holcombe: Why does Gov. Phil Scott want to give DOGE your grocery list?.","This commentary is by Rebecca Holcombe, of Norwich. She is a Vermont state representative for Windsor-Orange 2.


On March 20, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to break down “information silos” and gain “unfettered access” to data from every state program funded by the federal government. 
This includes a terrifying array of data: your psychiatric and health records, detailed financial data, photos, and more, all to be consolidated into a single massive federal surveillance database.
Then, last month, the Trump administration ordered states to turn over sensitive personal and financial data from Americans who have used SNAP, a food assistance program, in the past five years, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. In response, 21 states and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture, seeking to block the order.
Vermont was not one of those states.
Instead of joining those leaders who are standing up for their residents, Gov. Phil Scott handed over the data — without the consent of affected Vermonters. No press release. No consultation. Just quiet compliance.
Let’s be clear: This is not abstract. 
According to Vermont Public, these records include “names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and home addresses of all members of any household in Vermont that received SNAP benefits in the past five years.” The Scott administration even plans to share your specific food purchases. 
At least 1 in 5 Vermont households is affected. Many of them are working families, children, U.S.-born children of immigrants and people who lost jobs during the pandemic. 
This wasn’t just a technical decision. This was a political decision — and a moral one.
Other leaders said no. 
Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky called the order what it is: unlawful. California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta called it “a bait-and-switch of the worst kind.” As he put it, “SNAP recipients provided this information to get help feeding their families — not to be entered into a government surveillance database or be used as targets in the president’s inhumane immigration agenda.”
Why didn’t Scott do the same? Why didn’t he stand with other states to fight back? Why didn’t he give Vermont’s own attorney general, Charity Clark, a chance to resist in court? As Clark told Vermont Public, “(The Scott administration is) approaching this in a way that prevents me from being able to join a lawsuit.”
This is not how Vermonters expect our government to behave. Data collected to ensure that Vermont children do not go hungry is now being used to fuel a federal surveillance regime. It is a betrayal of consent, a violation of trust, and a direct contradiction of Vermont’s proud tradition of protecting privacy and resisting federal overreach.
This isn’t about “waste, fraud and abuse.” In 2024, Vermont had the fifth-lowest SNAP payment error of any state — a level even the Trump administration deems acceptable. The federal government explicitly stated that Vermont does not need corrective action on SNAP. So if they are demanding our personal information, it’s not to solve a problem with SNAP. It’s to serve a different agenda.
And yes, there’s an obvious and immediate threat: immigration enforcement. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, who requested the data from Vermont, has publicly called for “mass deportations” and “no amnesty under any circumstances.” The fear is not hypothetical. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is already using data-mined insurance claims as a “deportation tool.”
Now, thanks to Scott, ICE and other federal agencies may have access to the updated addresses and immigration statuses of tens of thousands of Vermont residents. Vermont did not send the National Guard to round people up, but we did tell the federal government where to find them.
Even federal technologists have warned against what’s happening. In a public resignation letter, 21 staffers from the Department of Government Efficiency wrote:
“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.”
But that’s exactly what Scott enabled. Once this data has been handed over, it cannot be taken back.
The people of Vermont deserve answers. We deserve to know what was shared, with whom and why. We deserve to know why our state’s leadership broke ranks with other governors who chose to defend their residents. We deserve to know how the Scott administration will protect the people who are now at risk: neighbors, children and families whose only “crime” was asking for help to eat.
Vermonters do not believe in big government surveillance. We do not believe in handing ICE a search engine to find our friends. We certainly do not believe helping feed your kids should cost you your privacy.

CHARLES, Illinois — If Gov. Greg Abbott is determined to pass a gerrymandered congressional map, Texas Democrats know he has the votes and the power to eventually get his way.

(Jamie Kelter Davis for The Texas Tribune)ST. CHARLES, Illinois — If Gov. Greg Abbott is determined to pass a gerrymandered congressional map, Texas Democrats know he has the votes and the power to eventually get his way.
But for the dozens of Democrats who left the state this week in protest of the map, it’s not just about winning — it’s about fighting.
Away from their families and regular jobs, Texas Democrats, most of whom are hunkered down in a suburb about an hour west of Chicago, are facing $500-per-day fines, civil arrest warrants and threats from Republican state leaders to remove them from office.
Now six days into the walkout, they plan to stay away until at least the end of the special session on Aug. 19. When they return, they face the possibility of being stripped of their leadership positions and even further marginalized in a chamber where they are already outnumbered. And no matter how long they stay away, Abbott can just call another special session to pass the map.
But it will all be worth it, they say, if they can lay the groundwork for a national fight over redistricting and ensure enough voters across the country understand what they frame as an attempt by President Donald Trump to stack the deck in the midterm election next year.
“It takes an act of defiance like this to wake up the country and let them know that our democracy is being stolen right in front of our eyes,” said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio in an interview. “If we’re going to be the spark that lights that fire, then we’re doing our jobs.”

When House Democrats last walked out in 2021 to stop new state voter restrictions, lawmakers were on the lam for over a month before the caucus fractured and enough members returned to restore quorum. Republicans quickly pushed the measure through, but Democrats say they were successful in drawing national and congressional attention to the topic and removing some of the worst parts of the bill.
This time around, they’re seeking to block a congressional map redrawn in the middle of the decade to create five new GOP seats next year, putting them at the front lines of an issue with national stakes: control of the U.S. House for the last two years of Trump’s term.
Those implications have elevated the Texas Democrats decamped in Illinois and elsewhere, stiffening their resolve and garnering them nationwide attention and support that they hope can help sustain their movement in a way that was missing four years ago.
“It’s not, Houston, we have a problem,” Martinez Fischer said. “It’s, America, we have a problem, and we need to rise up.”
The walkout, meant to deny Republicans the quorum needed to conduct legislative business and bring the House to a standstill, has also set off a possible national redistricting war. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has promised to draw more blue seats in his state if Texas approves its plan, and national Democratic leaders are looking to reshape maps in Illinois, New York and Maryland.
The effort reflects a push within the Democratic Party, particularly after last year’s disastrous election results, to re-establish itself to voters as a party of fighters willing to meet Republicans on their level.
“We are going to match Donald Trump’s energy when it comes to redistricting,” U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth said Monday. “Democrats we have shown up to a gunfight with nothing but good intentions and dull knives, and that era is over. We are not going to unilaterally disarm, and that is what’s different this time around.”

The message was reiterated repeatedly this week, with top Democrats from Illinois, New York, California and Massachusetts all joining the Texas delegation in pledging to stand up to the Trump administration, which is also pressing other red states to redraw their congressional maps in favor of the GOP ahead of next year’s midterm election.
“The Trump-Abbott gerrymander is a test case for the rest of the country,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said Tuesday alongside Texas Democrats. “What Republicans are trying to do in Texas is a model for other red states to lie, cheat and steal their way to victory.”
Democrats began floating the possibility of a walkout as soon as Abbott put redistricting on the special session agenda in July at the behest of Trump.
But in discussions over Zoom and in person before the session began, they decided that the stakes of the issue hadn’t yet been communicated to the public in a way that would explain a nuclear act. Some also held out for a committee process that might allow them to temper any draft map, or for a GOP proposal less aggressive than Trump had demanded.
Then, the Republican-led redistricting committee unveiled a map last week that would dismantle several Democratic districts to squeeze out five new red seats. While Republican lawmakers said the map was drawn purely to maximize partisan advantage — which is legal, according to the U.S. Supreme Court — Democrats saw a plan that would achieve that edge by suppressing the vote of people of color in violation of the Voting Rights Act.
“The power grab by Trump and Abbott doesn’t just have the goal of getting five more seats in Congress,” Rep. Ramon Romero Jr. said Tuesday, the eve of the Voting Rights Act’s 60th anniversary. “It has another goal, a goal more sinister than that, and that is to make people believe that their vote doesn’t really matter. That’s why it’s all of our fight.”

(Lucy Lu for The Texas Tribune)
With Republicans moving to approve the map at a quick clip, the determination to deny quorum solidified among Democrats in the 48 hours before they got on a chartered plane headed for Chicago. Others made their way to Albany to meet with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and to Boston for a state legislative conference.
Democrats say they’re buying valuable time by walking out, drawing attention to the issue among voters and getting other blue states involved — even while recognizing that Texas’ map is likely to get passed and will need to be fought in court.
“The spotlight has been turned on,” Rep. James Talarico of Austin said in an interview. “I’m hoping this courage that my colleagues and I have shown will be contagious, and it’ll inspire other legislators in blue states to respond with their own redistricting attempts.”
Using their hotel complex as a base camp, Democrats have done scores of media interviews out of their cramped rooms and a small park off the Fox River in Illinois; hosted news conferences with federal, state and party leaders at local union halls and blue state capitols; and met with Democratic governors and elected officials from across the country.
Talarico, who is mulling a run for U.S. Senate, said he did 25 interviews in the first 24 hours of the quorum break, ranging from TV and traditional platforms to podcasts with ranging ideological bents. His TV hits alone reached 9.8 million viewers across the country, he said, not including thousands of others on social media.

Republicans appear to have more paths toward maximizing their representation in Congress in a redistricting war with Democrats. Redrawing congressional maps in the middle of the decade will be harder for the handful of blue states that have clamped down on partisan gerrymandering by handing their redistricting authority to independent commissions.
Still, Texas Democrats see the support blue state and national Democratic leaders have expressed for retaliatory redistricting as a sign that their gambit is working.
“This, I think, is well on its way becoming a national fight, and that’s what’s going to be important if we’re going to counter” the GOP, said Rep. Chris Turner of Grand Prairie, who led the 2021 quorum break.
Republicans blasted the Democrats who left, arguing that they abandoned their office and were refusing to participate in the legislative process because they did not like the inevitable outcome. Critics also mocked the contingent for seeking refuge from Texas law enforcement in Illinois, which is heavily gerrymandered in favor of Democrats.
But Democrats said that by denying the House a quorum, they were doing the very job their constituents had elected them to do and were now demanding they follow through on.
While the 2021 walkout required Democrats to do a lot of explaining to their constituents about what a quorum break was and why they were doing it, Rep. Diego Bernal of San Antonio said, “this time around, they were telling us that their expectation was that we would use everything at our disposal to try and stop it.”

Democrats also said they don’t take the decision to leave lightly. Talarico noted that there’s an abundance of GOP legislation that Democrats stay and fight against in the chamber. They reserved the most drastic option for what he framed as “direct attacks on democracy.”
“We have to love democracy, even when we lose,” he said. “But we do that because we always have a chance to win the next election. And if this happens, we won’t — and so we have to take an extreme step to stand up for our constituents and for all Texans.”

The Vermont teen joined a growing list of baseball players from the Green Mountains to take the field for the Burlington baseball team. 
“It was around the winter or late fall of my senior year of high school. I reached out to my college coach and asked if it would be possible for me to play here this summer,” Davis said. “We gave (Lake Monsters head coach Matt Fincher) a call.”
It was a moment the right-hander had dreamed of just a few years earlier. 
“It sounds pretty cliché to say, ‘You can do what you put your mind to,’ but it is really true,” he said. “I remember coming to games — one in particular, my junior or sophomore year of high school — and I was just thinking, ‘Hey, I want to play here when I’m in college.’ So yeah, it’s a cliché, but there’s a lot of truth to it.”
He debuted for the team the summer after he graduated from Colchester High School, playing for a couple of months before heading to Bryant University, where he is now a rising sophomore.
For fellow pitcher Cole Tarrant, the story followed a similar script — minus the cafeteria. Tarrant, a southpaw also from Colchester, initially reached out to the Lake Monsters coaching staff, hoping to sign on for the summer after his first season at Hobart College in upstate New York. 
The rising junior has been coming to games since he was in Little League. 
“I remember when my grandparents brought me to a game — I was 6 or 7,” he said. “I thought, ‘Wow, this is really cool.’ It was always my dream to play baseball at a high level … It’s kind of a full-circle moment to be back out here.”
At the time, Fincher could only offer the lefty a temporary contract for the 2024 season. When injuries and departures inevitably created roster turnover, Tarrant had the chance to join the team for the full season.

After falling short of their championship aspirations last summer, both pitchers returned for the 2025 season. A couple of hours before facing the New Britain Bees last week, the pair reflected on their time with the team ahead of the Lake Monsters’ playoff start on Sunday.  
“I felt like it helped me a lot for my junior year, so I figured I’d do it again. I thought it could help me again this summer,” Tarrant said.
For Davis, the Monsters have represented the perfect place to hone his craft as a pitcher for Division I Bryant. 
“I have a lot of support, and I thank God for that,” Davis said. “I’m very grateful for my family, friends and the people that support me with what I do. Like, just for example — tonight, my whole family’s coming to the game. Family-friends are coming.”
Vermont is not necessarily known for producing top-end baseball talent. But both hurlers know that playing for the hometown team can be especially meaningful on the Little Leaguers who sit in the stands. 
“Even my parents have friends with little kids who tell me how awesome it is to come see me — ’cause they know me. I think that kind of inspires them, too,” Tarrant said. 
The Lake Monsters have not captured a championship since their run in summer 2021. For the guys in the dugout, the prospect of capturing the franchise’s second trophy in five years is, in Davis’s words, “really exciting.” 
“Some of us have been here since May, and guys have come in and out. But for a lot of us, this is the last little stretch,” he said. 
The Lake Monsters currently sit in second place in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League standings and boast a 38–19 record. 
“We have a chance to do something fun, something cool, and play baseball a little longer. No matter what happens, I love this team. I had a great time. I won’t regret anything we did this summer,” Davis said. 
Regardless of how this season ends, both pitchers feel their team is leaving a mark on baseball in Vermont. 
“They’ve been really successful here for four years now,” Davis said. “The organization’s done great on and off the field — they’ve created an environment that people want to come and watch. I only see it getting better.”

Today, only one man grows it.","On a recent July morning, Dwight Arnold stood in front of one of his Connecticut shade tobacco fields, the plants shielded from the sun by a white shade cloth, barking orders to the mix of men and local high school kids lying on the ground trying to pluck the lowest leaves on rows of 8- to 10-foot-high plants. 
It was the first round of picking for the last man growing Connecticut shade tobacco on his family’s farm — even though the farm is just across the border in Massachusetts.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
For over a century, cigars wrapped in light brown Connecticut shade tobacco have been considered among the best in the world and, as late as the mid-1980s, farmers from Suffield to Windsor were growing thousands of acres of it in what is known as the Upper Connecticut River Valley.
“Then the demand just kind of fell off, and one by one, they just kind of started to fall by the wayside and switched to something else,” Arnold said.
As demand dropped and the pressure to develop the land grew, many Connecticut farmers turned to an alternative: Connecticut Broadleaf.
Connecticut Broadleaf is easier to cultivate and is used as filler tobacco in many brand-name cigars. Experts say you can also grow more of it per acre, as much as 500 pounds more than shade.
But Arnold, whose great-grandfather purchased the Southwick farm in the 1870s, never stopped growing the iconic shade variety.

“There were years when we didn’t know who we’re going to sell it to, and I was only growing like 15 acres, and it was, well, let’s see if I can sell this stuff,” Arnold said.
This year, he planted 35 acres of shade tobacco because the General Cigar Co., which produces Macanudo brands, has agreed to buy it all for use in some of its premium cigars.
Connecticut shade actually comes from a Sumatran seed that was brought here around 1900, Arnold said. 
It is called shade tobacco because it grows with protection from the sun. The white cloth provides cover from the sun but also creates more humid conditions underneath it — similar to Sumatra.

Arnold and his crew of about 50 workers will do six pickings of the giant tobacco leaves; the very fine veins spreading from the stem separate shade tobacco leaves from other varieties, signaling potentially unmatched flavor. 
“Shade is so expensive to grow because it gets handled so many times. It has to be tied and wrapped as it grows up, picked by hand and then sewn together. It’s extremely labor intensive,” said Dr. James LaMondia, a soil scientist for The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, or CAES, who has been working with tobacco farmers since the 1980s.
But the intensive work that goes into growing and harvesting shade tobacco is one of the reasons many cigar companies shifted their operations away from the upper Connecticut River Valley to Ecuador and Nicaragua, which have similar soil and climates but decidedly cheaper labor.
“They’re paying somebody for a week, probably what workers here will be paid in a couple of hours,” LaMondia said.
The tobacco grown in South America uses Connecticut seed, but it is not the same.
“They’ll say it’s Connecticut shade tobacco, but that’s misleading, because it’s basically Connecticut seed but not Connecticut grown,’” LaMondia said, adding they “produce what I consider to be a lesser quality, but a better price.”

Arduous work
It’s 10 a.m. when Arnold yells for everyone to stop and take a 15-minute break. They started at about 7 a.m., when it was cooler out, but it’s hot now — even more so under the white shade cloth where the picking occurs. The mesh covering is made of polypropylene and is designed to replicate the humidity of Sumatra, Arnold said.
The mix of veteran pickers and younger local high school kids grab a drink from a water tank and wet their heads to cool off.
Arnold, a reed-thin 62-year-old, calls them all by name.

There’s Jackson, who has picked tobacco for 40 years. Henry, who is wearing a homemade contraption that looks like a large reverse fanny pack to protect himself as he slides along the ground, has been picking for over 30 years. Arnold makes sure to check on a teenage boy who just started picking a day earlier.
The work is arduous. They slide close to the ground so they can get the leaves at the bottom of the giant plants that are ready to be harvested. They then gently place the leaves into a 4-foot-long plastic bin, sliding halfway up each 400-foot row of plants and then down the next until the bin is full. The bins are placed on “sleds” custom-made by Arnold to exactly fit the bins inside. They pull the sleds by ropes at either end.
Full bins are left at the end of the row, covered with a cloth. If the tobacco wasn’t covered, Arnold said, the sun would start burning the tobacco within 20 minutes. However, a tractor usually comes along within minutes to grab the full bins and transport them back to the barn for stitching.

At every step, the tobacco must be handled gently, because the leaves must be pristine if they are going to be used to wrap a high-end cigar.
“They can’t have any blemishes. They can’t have any leaf spots,” LaMondia said. “It’s a high-risk crop, because before you ever get anything back, you’re putting out tens of thousands of dollars to produce the crop.”
The tobacco is transported back to a barn where another group of workers uses a machine, specifically designed for tobacco growers more than 70 years ago, that is a combination sewing machine and upside down conveyor belt to string the leaves together. 
Then, they are hung from the rafters inside the barn for up to six weeks at temperatures hovering around 100 degrees.

They first turn yellow and then ultimately a light brown that is similar to the color of beach sand.
Arnold said about 2,000 pounds of tobacco leaves can be hung in the barn. Once it’s dried, it will be shipped to the Dominican Republic, where Macanudo will finish the process, including drying it even more. 
It takes more than a year from when a tobacco leaf is picked to when it is ready to be used to wrap a cigar.

A different tobacco
The faded red barns on Arnold’s farm were once synonymous with the tobacco industry here in Connecticut. Hundreds of them dotted the country roads that cross the Upper Connecticut River Valley.
But as farmers stopped selling Connecticut shade, the barns slowly started to disappear. 
The starkest example of this can be found on the road leading to Bradley International Airport, where a row of tobacco barns that belonged to the O.J. Thrall Company — at one time perhaps the largest Connecticut shade tobacco producer in the state — were torn down and replaced with a giant Amazon warehouse.
Another long-time tobacco grower, H.F. Brown in Windsor, also stopped growing tobacco, switching instead to vegetables.
“My grandfather and father grew Connecticut shade tobacco and I do miss growing it, but it just didn’t make sense anymore,” said Kathleen Martin, current president of Brown’s Harvest. 
They now grow cucumbers, tomatoes and all sorts of berries.
But LaMondia said the idea that tobacco farming is dying in Connecticut is inaccurate.
“It’s still a major crop here. Depending on the year, tens of millions of dollars worth of tobacco are sold,” LaMondia said. “There’s probably about 3,000 acres of tobacco being grown in the valley, so it’s still going strong.”
USDA statistics back up that claim.
Connecticut’s tobacco yield increased significantly from 2017 to 2022, according the most recent data available from the USDA. In 2017, 46 farms covering 2,204 acres produced nearly 3.9 million pounds of tobacco. In 2022, 44 farms covering 3,056 acres produced more than 6 million pounds of tobacco.
But LaMondia said the new “pounds” are all broadleaf. He said at one time, shade tobacco grew on more than 1,000 acres in Connecticut. All of that is now gone, except for Arnold’s small operation.
With Broadleaf, the entire plant is cut at once from the bottom and hung to dry in a barn. It is a much easier crop to cultivate than Connecticut shade and quicker to get to market.
“It’s kind of shifted and moved from shade being king to broadleaf, which is most of the acreage now throughout the valley,” LaMondia said. 
Several farmers said they admire Arnold for sticking with tradition and still growing the shade tobacco that first brought notoriety to the area’s farmers.
Arnold does grow about 20 acres of Connecticut Broadleaf just to “hedge,” but as the last man growing Connecticut shade, Arnold thinks he’s fine.
“I realized there was still some market for it, and if I’m the only one growing it, well they’re going to have to buy it from me,” Arnold said. “As long as I can supply them with some quality leaves, they’ll keep coming back to me.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0722_SR_TobaccoFarm_028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-10 05:56:18.769805

Purists might have said the cross should have been flaming, but at least there were the hoods and the white robes and the desperate oaths and the silly language rife with the letter “k.” […]","Ku Klux Klan members gather at a parade in Virginia in 1922. (Library of Congress)On the big hill west of town they met on hot summer nights beneath a wooden cross illuminated with electric bulbs. Purists might have said the cross should have been flaming, but at least there were the hoods and the white robes and the desperate oaths and the silly language rife with the letter “k.”
This wasn’t the original Ku Klux Klan, the secret society formed by a half-dozen former Confederate officers in 1865 to terrorize newly freed Black people and to fight Reconstruction. That first Klan had been dismantled by 1872 and its hooded leaders jailed.
No, this was a reimagined Klan, a movement that had been sweeping Main Street America in a wave of nostalgia and bigotry. What was happening at night on the big hill just outside Coffeyville was similar to other meetings held across the country, with Protestant religion and patriotic fervor masking the worst impulses of those beneath the hoods.
The meetings weren’t strictly social occasions.
The Klan was organizing, running candidates for office, and attempting to insinuate itself into every aspect of civic life, under the guise that it was doing good charitable and patriotic work.
One citizen who wasn’t buying it was A.J. Valentine.
Valentine was the 39-year-old editor of the Coffeyville Morning News who thought the Klan meetings were both absurd and dangerous. In October 1922, he announced that the News had an informant in the ranks of the local Klan.
“One of the indoor sports in Coffeyville for several months has been figuring out who are the members of the cow pasture parties, held around Coffeyville about once a week,” a Page One notice read. “These parties have created so much interest that The Morning News has undertaken to enlighten its readers about them. So beginning tomorrow morning the News will start a serial story, giving the license tag numbers of these cars that assemble in cow pastures, also the owners of the cars, as shown by the secretary of state’s records.”
It was a risky move for Valentine.
A rival editor would later note, in a 1943 local history, that what Valentine may have lacked in discretion he made up for in bravery.
“Mr. Valentine was a courageous editor,” remembered local newspaperman C.C. Drake, who had helmed the Daily Dawn — a Klan newspaper. “He opposed the invasion of the Ku Klux Klan here and created a good deal of discussion as to the identity of his Klan reporter, who ignored the secrecy of the order and boldly published many inner happenings.”
Valentine’s paper was an upstart not yet three years old, struggling against the well-established Coffeyville Journal and other publications, including by 1923 the Daily Dawn.
Valentine had been born in Louisiana, married his wife, Mary, in Missouri, and had worked there as a bank solicitor. He came to Coffeyville in 1912 to become advertising manager for the Journal and was later elected county clerk as a Democrat. The Morning News had leaned Democratic from the start, Drake noted in his local history, but Valentine was never tied to party dogma.
The summer of 1922 had burned like a torch as the resurrected Klan spread its hooded influence across Kansas, its kleagles organizing new chapters in towns big and small. It may have seemed an unusual turn for a state that had been admitted to the Union as free on the eve of the Civil War, but that had been 61 years ago, and Kansans, like just about everyone else in America, had been buffeted by change.
A world war, a pandemic, and the disorienting rush of the Jazz Age had frightened many into longing for an imagined earlier time, a fictional America where there was moral order and political stability. There was also a cancerous nostalgic yearning for a time before so many people had so many freedoms. Like the old Klan, the resurrected version targeted Black people, Jews, and Catholics.
Encouraged by the 1915 film “Birth of a Nation,” the first blockbuster, which portrayed the original Klansman as heroes and Black people and carpetbaggers as rapists and villains, Americans in the millions flocked to join the new “Invisible Empire.”
For them, the hood and robes and fiery crosses had become symbols for real Americans, an exclusive club of white Protestant men (although there was a women’s auxiliary). If old Nathan Bedford Forrest had lived to see the new Klan he would have been perplexed, because the organization claimed to revere the American flag, a symbol of union the original Kluxers reviled.
Most of the 1920s Klan members were described as solid middle class citizens, according to historian Tim Rives, who wrote a history of the Klan in Kansas City.
“The stimulus to this Klan’s creation is more mysterious” than the original Klan or the one that would resurface in the 1960s to oppose the civil rights movement, according to Rives. “Its program of Americanism, Protestantism, Law and Order, and White Supremacy (was) less definite than the simpler hates of other Klan eras. The amorphous character of the Klan of the 1920s gave it the flexibility to adjust to whatever local conditions it found.”
Coffeyville became a stronghold of Klan activity, with the local chapter of the Invisible Empire railing against the perceived lawlessness of South Coffeyville, a town a mile to the south, across the Oklahoma line. It was Prohibition, and the Klan said bootleggers from South Coffeyville were a corrupting influence. But then, it thought jazz music and teen necking parties were wicked, too.
Valentine’s Klan reporter, whoever he was, first appeared in the Oct. 11, 1922, edition of the Morning News. The writer took the tone of a society editor reporting a black tie affair.
“One of the most delightful cow pasture parties of the season was held on the big hill west of the city,” the piece began. “It was a masquerade affair, white robe and white mask completely concealing the identity of each guest. The decorations consisted of a large cross which was lit up with electric light bulbs — the cows having been removed before the fun started.”
In a ceremony called “naturalization,” an oath was administered to new members, requiring allegiance to the Invisible Empire. The initiates were required to swear they would die before divulging Klan secrets.
“The guests did not give their names to the News’ cow pasture society reporter but the following automobile tags were noticed attached to the cars that were assembled.” A list of 10 tag numbers and the names the secretary of state had registered for each vehicle followed.
“At a late hour refreshments were served,” the reporter noted.
Over the next few days, additional installments in the cow pasture saga identified more vehicles and their owners. Letters began appearing in the Morning News from citizens who claimed somebody else had borrowed their cars to attend the Klan meeting. In one case, the executive of a pipeline company said he was the owner of record for a number of company vehicles, but he couldn’t control the movements of every auto.
Some of the hoods, at least, were finally off.
Other Kansas journalists had squared off against the Klan, with Emporia’s William Allen White the most noted. But Valentine, a relatively obscure editor astride a powder keg of bigotry and popular influence, may have had the most to lose.
He certainly was among the most audacious.
But Klan influence continued to swell in southeast Kansas, culminating in the beating of a local mayor, Theodore Schierlmann. His offense? He was Catholic, had spoken out against the Klan, and had refused to rent a local hall for a Klan function.
“Reign of Terror is On,” a Morning News headline declared.
On Oct. 30, Gov. Henry J. Allen came to Coffeyville and during a speech at a local theater denounced the Klan. It was a secret order, he said, operating without benefit of a state charter as required of other social and fraternal organizations.
“We confront in Kansas an astonishing development of prejudice, racial and religious,” Allen said, as reported by the Associated Press. “It is seeking to establish the un-American idea that we can improve the conditions in the state by turning it over to a masked organization which arrogates to itself the right to regulate the individual.”
Allen, a Republican, said he had instructed the state attorney general to expel every Klan official from the state.
The organization, he said, “has taken the old Ku Klux Klan from its grave. It has set up the incredible philosophy that we require religious instruction from masked men whose characters and capacities are concealed by disguise.”
On Dec. 8, 1924, an explosion wrecked the publishing offices and plant of the Daily Dawn, the Klan newspaper. Nobody was hurt in the 1 a.m. blast, but damage was estimated at $75,000 — or about $1.4 million in today’s dollars.
“Nitroglycerine was used,” reported a Nevada, Missouri, newspaper. “Besides wrecking the newspaper plant the blast badly damaged an adjoining grocery store, a bicycle shop and a florist shop. Almost the entire roof of the Daily Dawn building was blown off and the front and rear walls were blown out. Windows for several blocks were shattered.”
The damage wasn’t covered by insurance, editor C.C. Drake said. The newspapers the Journal and the Morning News offered the use of their plants to Drake, who attributed the blast to bootleggers. Although there were various suspects over the years, there were no arrests. The paper ceased operations in 1925.
Also in 1925, the Klan was officially declared illegal in Kansas.
But the legacy of the Klan lived on, especially in places like Kansas City, where a former Klansman held office for 30 years, according to Rives. There were also at least 41 incidents of lynching of Black people across the state to 1927, and perhaps more.
Race relations in Coffeyville boiled over when a white mob of thousands stormed city hall in 1927 seeking to lynch three Black men. The men had been falsely accused of raping two white high school girls. Although the Klan was not involved in the riot, the incident had the potential to be a disaster similar to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which left up to 300 Black people dead and destroyed the city’s prosperous African American neighborhood.
“The (Coffeyville) mob was driven back,” according to Geoffrey Newman in a 2013 master’s thesis, “first by Black deputies at the jail, then by armed African Americans who prevented their neighborhood from being torched. The National Guard occupied the city for five days.”
The incident was largely forgotten local history, Newman said, but deserved to be remembered.
“Coffeyville demands our attention because its activists won a victory against racism almost 25 years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott,” he argued. “Furthermore, the victory had its roots in a little-known court case that desegrated junior high schools statewide in Kansas 30 years before Brown. Yet these victories never created a national wave of change. Kansas … has remained remote from the centers of national discourse on race.”
In 1928, Valentine sold the Morning News. The paper was absorbed by the Journal the next year. In 1929, he took over as editor of a paper at Lincoln, Nebraska, and by 1940 was running a bookstore there.
Andrew Jackson Valentine died in 1966, aged 82.
His story — that of a small-town editor fighting a cultural torrent of hypocrisy and violence — is a just a minor part of the American saga. But it’s a story worth remembering, because all history is ultimately local history. What we do has meaning. Our individual acts of kindness and cruelty, our refusals to remember and our embrace of the past, imagined or actual, contribute to who we are as a nation.
Personally, I’d rather live in the America that A.J. Valentine thought was worth saving.

This week marks the 56th anniversary of the grand-daddy of all rock festivals… Woodstock. I was in my teens the summer of 1969, but couldn’t get off from my job to join the swarms of rock fans. But I did see most of them.
That summer I was as working as a “temp seasonal” toll collector on the Tappan Zee Bridge, joining Westchester and Rockland counties.  


Most days life as a toll collector on the Tappan Zee was a delight, as I was usually assigned to the far outside lane, also known as “the country club” because of its green vistas and views of the mighty Hudson River.
There were two things I learned in that job: how to roll quarters and how to listen to the radio. The tiny toll booths lacked air conditioning, but I could bring a fan or a radio. My portable FM entertained me eight hours a day as I listened to both the music and the FM DJ’s… a job I eventually earned at Long Island’s WLIR after college graduation.
New York’s FM stations were buzzing about Woodstock for weeks, and that Friday and much of Saturday, it seemed that every kid in the tri-state area was heading for Yasgur’s Farm. Most weekends were pretty crazy in my toll collecting job, because in those days tolls were collected in both directions… 50 cents north-bound and 50 cents coming home. (Today the toll is $6.75 roundtrip, if you have an E-Z Pass).
Busy as it was on summer weekends on that bridge, nobody expected a half-million people would show up heading to Woodstock, especially not the folks at the New York Thruway Authority. But after the rock fest was well underway, the Thruway brass realized the mobs would eventually be heading home, clogging the bridge. Because the music was expected to end late on Sunday, many of us temp-collectors worked overtime into the wee hours of Monday morning.
Late into the night we had five toll lanes open southbound, most of us enjoying some handsome overtime. However, traffic was so light, they sent us home by about 1 a.m.  But I was due back in the booth five hours later.
Of course, the music didn’t end until early that Monday morning, meaning that the usual morning rush hour carried as many burned-out hippies as it did regular business commuters. I remember one station wagon that pulled in to my toll lane, caked in mud up to the windows and stuffed with a dozen zonked-out kids.
“Hey man,” said the driver with bloodshot eyes that struggled to focus. “We don’t have any money” (to pay the 50 cent toll). “How about these instead?” That day, his Tappan Zee toll was an orange and a warm Coke.
Later that summer, after being reassigned to the New Rochelle toll barrier on the New England Thruway, I learned about the “exact change” lanes.  As folks threw their change into the basket, the coins went into a machine with rotating discs and holes the size of nickels, dimes and quarters. As the coins fell though the holes, their value was totaled and the driver could pull away.
What I didn’t know was the people threw more than coins into those baskets.
One day, while inside the booth removing change buckets, I heard a car stop in the lane outside followed by an ominous thump. Not the clinking of change, but a thump.
Imagine my horror as I watched an entire orange work its way down the change chute, hitting the rotating discs like a food processor, spewing orange juice and peel everywhere over the machinery, the buckets of coins and me.
Oh, for those days back in “the country club lane” back on the Tappan Zee!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tappan_Zee_1973-1024x792.jpg,,,2025-08-10 04:56:37.897872

Scott Jennings, a former McConnell staffer who has gained national notoriety as a commentator on CNN, was the emcee for the dinner. He opened the program with a promise to “roast Democrats” and touted wins by Republicans at the national level — particularly President Donald Trump’s second term in office. 
“They love it when we trash each other. They rejoice. It’s their only hope,” Jennings said of Democrats. “They can’t beat us, so they’re trying to will into existence a future where we beat ourselves through division and discord, but it’s not true. Whatever intra-party conversations we’re ever having, we all in this room know the true mission is to save our country.”
However, division is front and center in the GOP primary to replace McConnell. The primary is in May, a little over eight months away.
On Saturday night, the top contenders, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, Lexington businessman Nate Morris and Elizabethtown businessman Michael Farris, all fresh from speeches at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic last weekend, largely restated their main campaign points.
Morris was the last of the top three candidates to speak, but he used his remarks to respond to a question McConnell had asked at a Republican breakfast before the picnic, why “one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different” than him as the longest-serving party leader in the U.S. Senate.
“First and foremost, I don’t want to be the longest-serving anything in U.S. history,” Morris said. “That’s one of the reasons why I’m running. I think that politics should not be a career, and we know that career politicians have run our country off a cliff.” 
He then asked the crowd to think of the “career politicians” who “who stabbed us in the back” when the president came under fire from members of his party, such as when McConnell criticized Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
“I’m seeking this seat with term limits in mind. I’m going to serve two terms, and I think that’s enough. I think that’s enough to get done what we need to get done in Washington,” Morris said, before adding that he strongly believes the U.S. needs a “full moratorium” on new immigration to the country after deporting all people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. 
Cameron opened his remarks to say he’s “not running against someone. I’m running for something.” He touted his record as the state’s attorney general and reiterated his opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and transgender women and girls playing in female sports. 
“We need an American built on merit, excellence and intelligence,” Cameron said. 
Barr cited the Democratic Party’s low approval nationwide and emphasized his record voting for Trump’s agenda in Congress, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year. The congressman highlighted last week’s news that Apple plans to expand glass production in Harrodsburg, which is in his Central Kentucky district, and attributed the decision to the president’s trade and domestic manufacturing policies. 
Barr also spoke about his recently filed legislation to codify a Trump executive order that prohibits transgender women and girls playing in women’s and girls’ sports. Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who has vocally opposed including transgender women and girls in female sports, is supportive of the legislation, he noted. 
“As your next senator, I will keep males out of our daughters’ private spaces,” Barr said. 
Lifetime achievement award squabble 
McConnell only addressed the crowd to give a lifetime achievement award to Cathy Bell, a longtime Republican who is now the state party treasurer and has served in other roles for decades. 
McConnell presented Bell with the surprise award during the dinner. However, the Morris campaign had been convinced the award was going to go to McConnell, who Morris has repeatedly blasted as insufficiently loyal to Trump. Morris’ campaign had asked the Republican Party of Kentucky to deny McConnell the award. 
“I think they saw the writing on the wall, and they saw that we were contrasting why he shouldn’t get that award,” Morris told reporters after the dinner. A spokesperson for the state party declined further comment about the award
But speakers throughout the evening said McConnell has contributed to the party’s dominance over the past few decades. 
“We are blessed to stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and to have the opportunity to build on the momentum for the betterment of the commonwealth and for America. We are grateful for the leaders who have laid the groundwork for our Kentucky success, especially Leader McConnell,” Benvenuti said “And Leader McConnell — thanks for never forgetting the importance of a strong state party.” 
Justice told the crowd to give McConnell another round of applause before recalling how McConnell had convinced him to run for U.S. Senate.

Darryl Rouson speaking at WMNF Radio in Tampa on Aug. 8, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Tampa Bay-area Democratic state Sen. Darryl Rouson says he is open-minded about whether he’ll try to stay in the Florida Legislature next year by making a run for a Florida House seat.
Rouson, who turned 70 last month, has served in the Legislature since 2008 but is term-limited from running again for his District 16 state Senate seat in 2026. 
He says he is seriously considering filing to run for the House District 62 seat in Pinellas County, which will be open next year because Democratic incumbent Michele Rayner is departing to run for Rouson’s Senate seat.
“Well, it’s good to have to options, and I believe in experience plus relationship-building equals success. And I’ve been able to have great success, both in the House and the Senate, and things will take care of themselves,” he told this reporter while speaking on WMNF-88.5 FM radio in Tampa on Friday.
So does that mean he is running?
“Well, I’m weighing options, and it’s nice to have options,” he said. 
Although it’s more common for state representatives term-limited out of office to run for the more select state Senate (where there are just 40 members compared to 120 in the House), it’s not unprecedented by any means.
Last year, Melbourne Republican Debbie Mayfield won a seat in the House after being term-limited from her Senate seat (she ultimately won back that seat after it became open again when Randy Fine departed for Congress).
Brevard County Republican Thad Altman served in the House, the Senate, and then back in the House before being term-limited from office last year.
Pasco County Property Tax Collector Mike Fasano is another prominent legislator who couldn’t stay away from Tallahassee. The New Port Richey Republican served in the House from 1994 to 2002; in the Senate from 2002 to 2012; and returned to the House in 2012.
He departed from that seat a year later, when Gov. Rick Scott appointed him as tax collector, a job he’s held ever since.
Subverting term limits?
Florida voters approved eight-year term limits for members of the Florida Legislature in 1992. Some senators (like Rouson now) have been allowed to serve an additional two years due to a quirk in state law regarding redistricting.
In an apparent response to legislators who switch legislative chambers after completing their terms, now-Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia filed a resolution during the 2025 session (SJR 536) to clarify that the Constitution imposes a lifetime limit of 16 years in state legislative office — eight years max in the House, eight years max in the Senate.
There was a caveat for senators who serve reduced two-year terms due to redistricting. The measure would have gone to the voters as a proposed constitutional amendment in 2026, but stalled after being approved in one committee stop.
“Let’s stop the practice of people continually running for the same office and bouncing back and forth between chambers,” Ingoglia said on X. “Serving the people of Florida should be a privilege, and an honor, not a career.”
Redistricting issues
The configuration of Rouson’s Senate District 16 seat is being challenged in federal court by a group of voters living in both Pinellas and Hillsborough County who are represented by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University School of Law. They contend its design since 2022, including parts of St. Petersburg but moving across Tampa Bay into Hillsborough County, was the result of illegal racial gerrymandering.
During the trial, voters who live in Hillsborough County argued they weren’t being fairly represented because Rouson lives in St. Petersburg.
“I’ve done my level best to represent both sides of the Bay efficiently and effectively, and I think that I’ve done a pretty good job at that,” he said.
Three Democrats have already entered the race for House District 62: Kyandra Darling, Upton Fisher, and former state legislator Wengay Newton.
Darling addressed the rumors about Rouson’s potential entry into the race on Friday, issuing a statement on X saying, “I remain as committed to running and winning this race as I was on the day I declared my candidacy.” (That statement was first reported by Florida Politics).
Among the other topics Rouson discussed Friday were House Speaker Danny Perez’ memo to members calling for a select committee on redistricting congressional districts. Notably, Senate President Ben Albritton has yet to publicly comment about the idea.
“I think the Senate President is being very thoughtful and deliberate about his actions, and there’s no urgency to do this now,” Rouson said. 
“We’ve got a lifetime between now and November, when we get back for committee weeks, and we should study what’s happening in Texas and in California and the other states like New York that are intending to do some things. We shouldn’t be knee-jerk reactors to what other states are doing. We need to do what’s good for Florida.”
Published reports indicate Florida Republicans are considering a redrawing of the congressional map that could net them three additional congressional seats. Rouson is skeptical. They already control 20 of Florida’s 28 congressional districts.
“I think that the GOP should tread very carefully, because if they try to stretch their advantage too thin, it could backfire in ways that they don’t foresee right now,” Rouson said. 
“For example, if they diminish the margins for incumbent Republicans, thinking that they are safe, small shifts in the future could make districts competitive and give an advantage to the Democrats to gain more seats.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins came to the Iowa State Fair Saturday to compete in the Governor’s Charity Steer Show — and to announce $152 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture investments for Iowa rural development projects.
Before heading to the Livestock Pavillion to show the steer Snoop Dog, Rollins announced that 19 projects in Iowa would receive funding through USDA Rural Development grant and loan programs. The announcement was made at a news conference where she was joined by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and state Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig.
Approved projects include a $37 million loan for the Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center to expand and renovate its facility, a $5 million grant and $39 million loan for the City of Emmetsburg to replace its wastewater treatment facility, and a $27.7 million loan to the Southern Sioux County Rural Water System for the building of new wells, a treatment plant and transmission lines in Plymouth and Sioux Counties.
“This unprecedented, coordinated rural development project will help boost the rural economies, develop rural infrastructure and encourage private investments,” Rollins said.
Reynolds celebrated the investment and thanked Rollins for working closely with Iowa, saying “during this time of uncertainty in the ag economy, I’m so grateful to have a partner that we can rely on.”

She said the new investments will make a difference in rural Iowa communities. Reynolds said when she visited the Guthrie County Hospital in May, where she signed a law aimed at expanding medical training opportunities and rural health care access, the hospital CEO had told her about how much of a difference the USDA funding would make in helping the facility continue to provide health care in their community.
Rollins said the investment is part of a larger effort from President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress aimed at “putting farmers first again,” which she said is also being done through new international trade agreements, investments in farm safety net programs and agriculture components of the budget reconciliation bill passed.
Though much of the focus on discussing the “big, beautiful bill” has surrounded the cuts and changes to public assistance programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Rollins said the bill “protected two million family farms from the death tax,” increased reference prices and extended clean fuel production tax credits.
“Most of the mainstream media focused on, ‘Oh, these horrible cuts that are going to cause death and destruction across the world’ — which, of course, none of that was true,” Rollins said. “In fact, we were investing more money, Congress was, into our agriculture sector and putting farmers first.”
Some agriculture policy advocates have said the budget reconciliation bill, which cuts SNAP funding while increasing spending on farm subsidies, will further consolidate the agriculture industry and benefit wealthy farmers.
It’s the second event Reynolds and Rollins have held together this week. On Monday, the Iowa governor was in Washington, D.C. for a news conference where Rollins signed six waivers approving restrictions on purchases of certain food items through the SNAP. Rollins approved Iowa’s waiver to limit unhealthy foods available to buy through SNAP in May.
USDA also approved an Iowa waiver to implement an summer eating program for kids, called Healthy Kids Iowa, earlier in the year. The demonstration project, providing a box of food valued at $40 each month for families in need through 264 access points across the state, is an alternative to the SUN Bucks program, also known as Summer EBT, that provides $120 per child each month during the summer to eligible families that can be used at retailers accepting SNAP.
Both of these efforts are aimed at reducing unhealthy eating habits, the governor said, though hunger advocates have argued these steps make it more difficult for Iowans to access food assistance.
Rollins also spoke on her announcement in July for the USDA to restructure and consolidate parts of the agency, in part by relocating some of USDA workforce outside of Washington, D.C. to five regional hubs in North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, Colorado and Utah.
The list has “no Iowa, but there are more announcements coming,” Rollins said. She said Iowa is well represented at the USDA, with many agency employees in the state and several Iowans in USDA leadership positions.
“The bottom line is moving the power out of Washington, returning the government to the people, and having people that are better able to serve our constituents, who are closer to them,” Rollins said. “So that is the bigger (arch), but more news coming in the days to come.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rollins.steershow-scaled-e1754776297556-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-08-09 19:57:23.972697

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)ITHACA, Nebraska — President Donald Trump’s ag secretary visited Nebraska after a Saturday storm and faced questions from farmers about some dark skies facing agriculture, including a few clouds some said the administration stirred.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins heard about tariffs and trade in a closed-press roundtable at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Eastern Nebraska Research, Extension and Education Center. 
Rollins got an inkling of the economic disruption of on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs with key trade partners for Nebraska agriculture, including Mexico and Canada, attendees said. 
She also heard some thanks from local producers for the Trump administration’s progress toward trade expansion into major markets, such as Japan, South Korea and Australia.
Nebraska delegation hosts Rollins

She was joined by Nebraska U.S. Reps. Don Bacon, a member of the House Ag Committee, Rep. Mike Flood, who leads the House Main Street Caucus, and Rep. Adrian Smith, from the Ways and Means Committee.
The four from Nebraska’s five-member, all-GOP delegation emphasized the help and benefits coming Nebraska’s way from the tax and spending cuts bill they recently passed. The fifth, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., told Fischer he had a scheduling conflict. 
Fischer, whose family operates a cattle ranch near Valentine, talked about the importance of providing tax certainty for planning at a time of increasing costs for ag inputs.
National statistics indicate that Nebraska and neighboring Iowa lost more than 6% of their gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2025, the worst declines nationally, led by ag.
Growers voice concerns
Row-crop producers face the most difficult economic conditions after years of depressed pricing and now with tariffs added, producers told the secretary and delegation.
Rollins acknowledged that many growers may need federal help with price supports and affording fertilizer after many of them extended themselves to get through operations in another tough year.

The secretary said that’s why it was important — with the farm bill delayed in Congress — that some baseline protections for crop pricing were included in the GOP tax and spending bill Trump has labeled “big” and “beautiful.”
“Row croppers have been operating at a loss for a number of years,” Rollins said. ”That’s not sustainable.”
She and Fischer said Trump knows the issues facing farmers and ranchers and teased that his administration would act soon to offer some relief, including some help with farm labor.
“There’s a lot of risk involved in agriculture,” Fischer said. “You can’t control the weather. When you drove up today, you probably saw some corn that was stripped by the wind. 
“That’s why these safety nets are so important for crop producers, that they have that.”
Flood, who represents an eastern Nebraska district that includes Lincoln, said he has been talking with growers and bankers who say they need help to reduce the risk of defaulting on loans.
“Corn’s at $3.80 a bushel,” Flood said. “That doesn’t pay the bills.”
Boosting trade could help
Bacon, who represents the Omaha area, said that Nebraska needs to get more corn and soybeans “out the door” and that tariff uncertainty and a new jobs report concern him.
He argued that free trade is his preferred approach, and that it’s better for the economy, but he said he understands the president sometimes has to act to address trade imbalances.

Bacon said some producers tell him they will need help, and one of the best ways to help is by expanding the reach of biofuels into aviation fuel and higher ethanol blends in gasoline.
“It’s the only way you’re going to move enough corn and soybeans,” he said. “Otherwise you’re going to have a depression, and … we’re going to see it pretty squarely.”
Bacon, who is not running again for the 2nd Congressional District seat in 2026, said Trump had made enough progress slowing down border traffic that he could announce new visa efforts for ag workers.
The Trump crackdown on migrant workers has left some ag producers with a labor shortage, including in one of Nebraska ag’s good-news stories: an increasing number of dairies.
Defending Trump
Smith, who represents Nebraska’s sprawling, rural 3rd Congressional District, one of the country’s most conservative, defended Trump’s trying to get fairer deals from other countries. 
Feds say Nebraska GDP shrunk more than 6% in early 2025, led by ag

Smith has previously said he is no fan of tariffs, but that he considers them a tool in the president’s negotiating toolbox that he has used effectively to wring concessions.
Smith said Trump is dealing with the hand he was dealt. The congressman spent much of the past four years criticizing the Biden administration for letting ag trade languish as a back-burner issue.
People who served in the Biden administration U.S. Department of Agriculture have argued they prioritized trade. But Smith said more could and should have been done, as evidenced by a new deal with the United Kingdom.
He told Rollins he appreciated her “bringing attention to the challenges facing agriculture.” Bacon stressed that even in urban Omaha, one in three jobs are tied to agriculture. 
Research’s role
Fischer and Flood stressed the importance of the federal government and USDA continuing to invest in ag research at land-grant universities like UNL.

Flood said he is working with Fischer to secure the last $60 million needed to get the USDA research facility finished on Lincoln’s Nebraska Innovation Campus for 300 USDA researchers.
Rollins toured a UNL-managed feedlot in Saunders County with Derek McLean, dean of the Agricultural Research Division at UNL’s Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
It was the secretary’s second trip to Nebraska and the first leg of a two-stop trip sending her next to the Iowa State Fair to join Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds showing steer in Des Moines.
Said Fischer: “Our delegation understands the importance of agriculture. We are really, really fortunate to have a secretary like Secretary Rollins. She is easy to reach out to.”

Now is the moment to take careful stock of how we’ve spent federal funds and where we should invest going forward. 
The post In the face of federal cuts, Mass. must spend transportation dollars right appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","EVERY DAY, we hear of federally funded projects being terminated as part of a troubling pivot away from equity and logic. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill is potentially estimated to rescind over $4.7 billion in competitive grants for transportation alone – including $327 million from a grant to the Allston Multimodal Project to rework a section of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Climate and transportation sector projects are distinctly vulnerable to these terminations and funding pauses, something that brings a worrisome outlook for the future.  
Transportation contributes to almost 40 percent of emissions in Massachusetts, which highlights its interconnectedness to the climate and, ultimately, to public health. To fulfill Massachusetts’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, we must ensure that we spend every federal dollar we do have to move the state in a cleaner, more equitable direction.  
A new, interactive tool and analysis shows Massachusetts, compared to other states, largely making progress in spending federal transportation dollars on the right things. Using data from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, this analysis demonstrates that Massachusetts is on track, compared to baseline emissions levels before the 2021 legislation, to reduce over 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2022 and 2040. This is thanks to smart investments in public transit – buses and passenger rail, electrification, and active transportation modes like pedestrian, street, and bike safety infrastructure.  
This is terrific news. But in an era where the current federal government is working against climate action at every step, we need to take a deeper dive and see what more we can do.  
The analysis shows that Massachusetts could potentially reduce an additional 500,000 tonnes of emissions by 2040, and save $250 million, if roadway capacity expansion project funding is dedicated to mobility options that have emissions reducing co-benefits. 
Take Springfield, a city with among the highest rates of asthma in the country. A look at the kind of projects funded there by Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act money shows that the biggest funding – $30 million – went toward interstate highway maintenance, outpacing funding for active transportation 10 times over. 
Now is the moment to take careful stock of how we’ve spent federal funds and where we should invest going forward. The magnitude of the impact of clawed-back funds is unnerving, and, as a state, we need to look at more pragmatic ways of dealing with this imminent reality. Here are some areas where strategic thinking and decision-making could make a difference. 

The Infrastructure and Jobs Act is set for reauthorization next year, a process that will determine how much transportation money will be carved out for transportation, and how and where those monies are going to be spent. This is a real opportunity to influence priority-setting by making sure that there is emphasis on public transit, rural transportation, and multi-modal transportation systems that have clear health and climate co-benefits. 


The unmistakable correlation between transportation and climate should be reflected in how we plan and spend for our transportation networks. Measures like the Freedom to Move bill will do this by championing more public transit opportunities and providing multi-modal options for travel, rather than expanding and over-relying on traditional road infrastructure. It does so by making our dollars work better for our needs and our climate, offering a more thoughtful way of embedding climate and transportation justice considerations into the transportation project planning process. This ensures that transportation dollars are not spent on initiatives that degrade air quality and instead have emission-reduction benefits that ultimately help improve health outcomes and give us all more options for how to get around.  


Finally, we must ensure we have enough state revenue to go around to make any of this possible. Our Funding Our Future report offered concrete solutions for more sustainable funding sources, and yet only short-term measures have been taken. The MBTA is the only major transit agency in the country that does not have a designated source for capital expenditure, and Western and Central Massachusetts yearn for more direct connection to Boston. While Fair Share dollars from the new levy on income over $1 million have saved the day, its surplus is set to taper as collection estimates and expenditure caps become more accurate over the next couple of years. 

Although the federal funding landscape is far more uncertain than when the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was passed, the Commonwealth is equipped with ways to overcome these challenges – starting by taking a clear-eyed view of what we’ve spent so far where, and how we can invest in choices that bring us cleaner air, more equitable and reliable ways to get around, and a climate resilient future.   
Reggie Ramos is executive director of Transportation for Massachusetts.

“With me in the White House,” he said in his March 14 address, “you once again have a president who will always have your back.”
Two weeks later, in one fell swoop, Trump’s Department of Justice slashed an estimated $500 million in federal funding to programs to help local and state justice initiatives, including policing, crime prevention, victim services and juvenile justice. The grants varied in size from $50,000 to nearly $30 million and included efforts ranging from a community policing program to work with teens in Houston to money for an extra investigator to help prosecutors in Oregon go after fentanyl dealers.
The cuts have emerged as one of the most glaring tensions between Trump’s rhetoric and his actions on law enforcement in the first six months of his second term. But it’s far from the only one. The result has been a complicated relationship with law enforcement groups, some of whom say the president’s actions have at times been contradictory.
Just this week, for example, the Trump administration protected the union contract for more than 4,000 Veterans Affairs police, firefighters and security guards, while canceling the contracts of almost all other workers’ unions in the agency. But on the same day, Trump threatened a federal takeover of Washington D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department.
“The consensus from people who have expressed their opinions to me is that he’s talking out of both sides of his mouth,” said Ashley Heiberger, a policing professor at Moravian University and a 22-year police veteran.

The disconnect began on Inauguration Day, when Trump pardoned more than 1,000 people convicted in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, including hundreds who were guilty of assaulting police, calling the rioters “hostages.” Many police unions and professional organizations criticized the move, saying Trump was putting police in danger by absolving people who had attacked officers. “Those convicted of [killing or assaulting] law enforcement officers should serve their full sentences,” said the national Fraternal Order of Police, along with the International Association of Police Chiefs, in a joint statement.
Since then, however, Trump and his Department of Justice have held themselves out as the protectors of state and local police, backing away from civil rights investigations involving at least a dozen police agencies. And police unions applauded an executive order Trump issued in April that promised, among other things, free legal representation for law enforcement agents accused of crimes in the line of duty and more local law enforcement access to military weapons and equipment.
More recently, Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office recommended a one-day sentence — with that time already served — for Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in the 2020 shooting death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Legal experts described the move as unprecedented because the recommendation was far below the sentencing guidelines. The judge in the case ultimately sentenced Hankison to 33 months in prison.
In June, leaders from the nation’s largest police union also praised the temporary tax cut on overtime pay in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, saying that it will help with police recruitment and retention, because overtime is an important part of compensation for many officers. The overtime tax cut lasts through 2028, according to the IRS.
But in other realms, Trump’s promises on cutting federal funding and his allegiance to his political allies has cut against the cozy relationship with police.
The administration and leaders of some of the nation’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies — particularly those in large, diverse cities — have clashed on issues like immigration enforcement and the Department of Justice’s stance against diversity initiatives.

Some local and state police officials are particularly concerned about the $500 million in cuts to their agencies and to organizations that support public safety efforts. Bondi has branded the cuts as a move to more directly invest in local and state police agencies. But some agencies are already feeling a budget crunch.
In June, a group of law enforcement leaders from around the country sent a letter to Bondi urging her to restore gun violence prevention grants, saying the money fueled initiatives that reduced homicides and other crimes, according to Reuters. So far, the Department of Justice has not changed course.
Some of the budget cuts targeted funding for police officer training and wellness, technical assistance for rural departments and other grants to law enforcement. But the biggest cuts affected other efforts — many run by other public agencies or non-profit groups — that augment and complement policing, like mental-health crisis responders, substance abuse programs, and community violence intervention.
In early July, a federal judge allowed the cuts to proceed, while calling them “shameful.” Judge Amit Mehta, in Washington D.C., concluded that the administration’s action “is likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence,” but that it wasn’t within his power to stop it. “Displeasure and sympathy are not enough in a court of law,” Mehta wrote.
A staffer from the Department of Governmental Efficiency compiled the initial list of programs to be cut, according to reporting from Reuters. Justice Department officials said they were pivoting to putting the money towards programs that more directly supported law enforcement, but experts told The Marshall Project that the shift is not supported by the data.
“What’s so striking about these cuts, is that it really undermines the administration and [the Justice] Department’s stated claims to prioritize tackling violent crime, because many of the grants that we looked at were doing precisely that,” said Nicole Ndumele, a former Department of Justice deputy attorney general who now works as a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning, non-partisan, criminal justice think tank. Ndumele was part of a team that analyzed the cuts and concluded that they are likely to increase crime.
The cuts, she said, “really get to the heart of undermining everyone in America’s shared interest in living in a safe community.”

A number of the federal cuts targeted policing research, for example a $1 million grant to study whether officers who train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu might use less force or sustain fewer personal injuries on duty. The Marshall Project investigated this concept in 2021, as it was beginning to catch on in departments across the country, and found very little empirical data on the effort.
Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said that research like this is invaluable because police departments are often on their own in determining what kind of training to pursue.
“American policing needs to know what works, period. And there’s no central repository to get that information,” Wexler said. He noted that Justice Department-funded studies are often the closest thing the country has to a “Good Housekeeping Seal of approval that police departments can have in determining what training works.”
In rural Covington County in southern Alabama, another of the now-cancelled grants had been paying for a “Connect and Protect” program that paired sheriff’s deputies with mental health professionals in responding to certain calls and trained officers in crisis de-escalation. The program also set up a telehealth system so that people in crisis could be evaluated on the spot instead of hauled to jail or the emergency room.
The loss of funding has led to staff departures, and will force officers back to handling mental health calls alone, according to a spokesperson for the South Central Alabama Mental Health Center, which administers the program. “If funding is not restored, we risk reverting to a fragmented and reactive system, where law enforcement bears the burden of mental health crises, and individuals in need face unnecessary trauma, delays or incarceration,” the center said via email.
Other programs are somewhat more optimistic about weathering the loss of funding. The 30×30 Initiative, for example, is an effort by the Policing Project and New York University law school seeking to increase the proportion of women police officers in the U.S. to 30% by 2030. The effort is built on research that shows female officers use less force and less excessive force, face fewer lawsuits and are generally perceived as more trustworthy and compassionate by people affected by violent crime.
Maureen McGough, the program’s chief of strategic initiatives, said the funding cuts will limit the effort’s effectiveness, but she’s still bullish on their prospects. “I can’t overstate how much state and local [law enforcement agencies] have stayed with us,” McGough said, even as the federal government cuts funding and as federal agencies pull out of partnerships with 30×30. “I have so much faith in this current and next generation of law enforcement leaders to promote this work internally, which is where it matters most.”
Trump’s stance on policing-related issues at the start of his second term has surprised even some people who worked for the Justice Department the first time he was in office. Federal prosecutors tried to withdraw from most Obama-era investigations of police during Trump’s first term, but the Justice Department still investigated and found civil rights violations in the police department in Springfield, Massachusetts. Trump also pulled back federal grant money for policing in his first term, but people in the policing sector say this round of cuts is far more severe.
Even though many of the groups affected by the cuts are not directly embedded in local police agencies, sheriffs and police chiefs are bracing for the indirect impacts.
The Marshall Project reached out to dozens of police agencies for this story. Almost all declined to comment or did not return calls and emails.
Chief Mitchell Davis III at the Hazel Crest Police Department in a suburb of Chicago was an exception. He’s on the board of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and a past president of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.
Davis said his department of 37 sworn officers has not experienced cuts yet. But most of his supplemental funding comes from federal grants handed out on the state level, so he thinks he will have to abandon his hopes to keep up with the latest advances in crime-fighting equipment.
“I don’t know anyone who’s got enough money,” Davis said of local police departments. “We all rely to some extent on federal funding, and when that is taken off the table, it’s going to hinder us.”

Aug. 8, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceTRAVERSE CITY – U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers was scheduled as one of the keynote speakers at a glitzy Republican dinner on Friday to honor the late state Sen. George McManus of Traverse City, but after an hour of shaking hands and greeting up north party fixtures, Rogers left early and never addressed the crowd.
His campaign for the U.S. Senate said Rogers was happy to be there but had another campaign event in Gaylord and that the dinner was running over time, prompting his exit. But the crowd at the dinner appeared to be visibly bewildered when it was announced midway through that Rogers was no longer there and they wouldn’t get to hear him speak, seeing as how he was one of the main draws of the evening.
Few people at the dinner were aware of any other Republican event featuring Rogers in the region that evening.
The campaign did not respond when asked about the nature of the event Rogers left to attend.
The McManus dinner, held in a sprawling conference center space at the Great Wolf Lodge in scenic Traverse City, however, started promptly at 6 p.m. as planned and concluded right around the stated 9 p.m. end time.
There was talk at the dinner that Rogers was upset because he was not speaking first – U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) was scheduled to speak first, and did.
Bergman told the Advance afterward that the rumor of Rogers demanding to speak first was inaccurate, and that last minute scheduling items often come up for candidates seeking important federal office.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The itinerary clearly showed that Bergman was first in the order, but Bergman made a comment at the beginning of his speech that he didn’t think he was supposed to be going first.
Still, Rogers never spoke to the crowd, first or otherwise. He and his campaign staff were present in the room for the opening prayer and pledge of allegiance, but were absent when the speaker portion began.
As the night wore on, some patrons, who were seated close to an area for the Advance and other local press, could be seen whispering to each other and repeatedly pointing to the itinerary of speakers.
Rogers and his wife created a social media video showing them at the Great Wolf Lodge on Friday, saying that the room was packed with Republicans who were fired up for the 2026 contest. It is unclear when the video was taken – before he entered the building or when he was on his way out the door.
His Facebook page, where the video was posted, did not feature a mention of another event later that evening.
Rogers did, however, post pictures from the Cops & Doughnuts location in Gaylord on Saturday morning, which indicated that he had visited the city at some point this weekend.
Dennis Lennox, a political consultant and one of the co-organizers of the event, spoke to the Advance on Saturday in his personal capacity and not as a representative of the group behind the dinner.
Lennox said that he also was unaware of any other event planned in Northern Michigan on Friday evening, nor was there an event that other attendees knew about.
Indeed, the affair on Friday was a venerable who’s who of up north Republicans, party folk from around the state and donors who attended the dinner in honor of McManus, a well-respected regional Republican senator who served in the upper chamber for a decade.
“It’s unfortunate because a lot of people came to the dinner looking forward to hearing the presumptive Republican nominee for United States Senate, and for whatever reason, did not get an opportunity to hear from him,” Lennox said. “Now, with that said, I would also, for the record, say that pretty much everybody in attendance last night is a political person, current or former, and understands that things come up and can, and things can and do happen.”
Lennox did note that the situation was odd, either way.
Still, the event continued on unabated, allowing other Republican candidates an opportunity to speak to donors and GOP faithful in Michigan’s north country.
That included gubernatorial candidate Tom Leonard and attorney general candidate Doug Lloyd, who many at the event said were the stars of the show.
Leonard says Michigan Republicans should focus more on mental health care
Leonard needed no introduction as the former Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, the former 2018 nominee for attorney general and a candidate for the same office in 2022.
Yet the dinner, which featured no other candidates for governor on the speaking schedule, used the address as a case for why Republicans should nominate him in the 2026 primary.
“When you look at the state of this state right now, did you know the only state that Michigan beat for population growth the first two decades of this century was West Virginia? We are currently 49 out of 50 in unemployment. We are bottom 10 for income total, and if we don’t change it, the next few years, we’re going to be 49 out of 50,” Leonard warned. “The last thing I want, the last thing anybody in this room wants, is for their child or their grandchild to come to them and say, ‘Dad, Grandma, Mom, grandpa, I’ve got to leave the state for better opportunity.’”
Although Leonard said trips to Florida for family time doesn’t sound half bad, he can’t rationalize giving up the fight and letting nearby states like Ohio steal Michigan’s future.

“We’ve got to turn this around,” Leonard said, and made a case for how he would do it.
The candidate mentioned state occupational licensure reform, which has bipartisan support in the state Legislature, to help reduce hoops for licensed professionals seeking to practice in Michigan.
On education, Leonard made another pitch for Republicans to stand steadfast behind school choice, particularly home schooling, which he said has been under attack for years.
Another issue that Leonard championed on Friday evening was expanded access to mental health care. 
That push may very well resonate with people in Traverse City following the recent tragic multiple stabbing event at an area Walmart. The alleged perpetrator reportedly had severe mental health issues that went unaddressed, and many have said that better access to care might have prevented the stabbing.
“Why should Republicans ever shy away from mental health reform? … This is something that’s been near and dear to my heart for nearly 20 years,” Leonard said. “I always ask this question, ‘why is it that we should wait for somebody to hurt themselves or hurt somebody else before we get them the help that they need?’ Republicans ought to be running on this issue.”
Leonard also said Republicans in the next cycle need to run on positivity and solutions and not on old grievances against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or any of the candidates seeking to succeed her.
“I talk to police officers that are overwhelmed because of this mental health crisis that is facing our state, and frankly, they don’t want a candidate for governor, they don’t want any politician, that’s going to go out there every single day dividing us, dividing others, and poking others,” Leonard said. They want somebody that’s going to listen to them, and they want something that’s going to bring real solutions to the table and solve their problems.”
Leonard concluded by saying that’s what Republicans are going to see with his campaign over the next several months.
Lloyd touts prosecutor work in Eaton County as pathway to AG’s office
The fight to elect a Republican to the attorney general’s office after eight years of Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel is also of high priority for the GOP faithful across the state.
Lloyd, the current Eaton County prosecutor, said his experience in the office will translate well into the state’s top law enforcement position. He said that the attorney general is also tasked with protecting constitutional rights, not just prosecuting crimes, adding that it takes experience to be able to counsel the Legislature against making bad laws that could harm citizens, and to have the restraint to focus on state issues, a knock on Nessel’s push to repeatedly sue the administration of President Donald Trump on a multitude of federal policies in the opening months of his second term.

“We see local sheriffs and prosecutors who are understaffed and overwhelmed every single day as they battle to fight and continue on with the large case loads that they must carry,” Lloyd said. “But instead of the attorney general using her resources in a way that is beneficial to the state, she decides to play political games, filing suits against the Trump administration, instead of actually being a leader.”
Lloyd asked Republicans in the room to help nominate an attorney general candidate who could actually win the general election, a subtle knock against candidates in the past who lost to Nessel, which includes Leonard and former 2022 nominee Matt DePerno. 
To Leonard’s credit, his race against Nessel was incredibly close, with the Republican candidate losing by less than 3 percentage points. DePerno, however, lost to Nessel by nearly 10 percentage points.
“In 2026 what you need to understand is that Republicans must win,” Lloyd said. “We need to nominate candidates who can actually rally the party and the votes. We will need winners, not distractions.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8084391-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-09 15:57:11.675456

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)In agreeing to deploy the Nevada National Guard to help carry out the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, Gov. Joe Lombardo is “turning Nevadans against Nevadans,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus.
Titus was among several Nevadans who expressed harsh reactions to Lombardo’s decision.
Lombardo’s office told the Nevada Independent Friday that about two dozen Nevada National Guard personnel will be providing “administrative” assistance to U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Defense Department late last month authorized several states, all with Republican governors, to deploy National Guard assistance with mass deportation efforts. The DOD statement said National Guard personnel would provide “case management, transportation and logistical support, and clerical support for the in- and out-processing” of undocumented people at ICE detention facilities. 
The DOD statement noted the federal government would pay for National Guard assistance.
Lombardo is the latest Republican governor to agree to the Trump administration’s overture seeking National Guard support for ICE activities.
Several states (including Florida, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennesee, Idaho, South Carolina, and Wyoming) have so far announced or confirmed National Guard personnel will be accordingly called up, with several others poised to join them.
ICE’s tactics, which have included masked men apprehending people off the streets in unmarked cars, and detaining people with no criminal records and U.S. citizens, have been met with a barrage of criticism and scrutiny.
Immigration has consistently been Trump’s strongest issue in polling over the years. But a Gallup poll last month found 35% of respondents approving of Trump’s handling of immigration, while 62% disapproved.
At least one Republican governor has declined to authorize the National Guard.
A spokesperson for Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said due to “concern for the tactics, and disruption that some of those tactics are causing, in workplaces and communities,” the Vermont National Guard would not be called up to help ICE.
Concern about tactics and disruption were similarly cited by Nevadans who blasted Lombardo’s decision.
“The Nevada National Guard’s mission is to protect us, not sow more fear in our communities by doing Trump’s dirty work,” Titus said Friday on X.
The Nevada Latino Legislative Caucus issued a statement Friday evening saying Lombardo “has chosen Trump over Nevada.”
“He is not protecting our communities, he is helping to tear them apart,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Gonzalez, NLLC caucus chair.
“Mass deportations,” the NLCC statement continued, “will devastate Nevada’s families, our economy, and our reputation. Tourists will be scared away, small businesses will lose workers, and neighborhoods will be militarized. Children will fear going to school. Families will live in constant terror.”
The state “deserves leaders who will stand up to Washington when it threatens our values, not roll over and hand them the keys to our state,” the NLCC statement added.
Saying Nevada Republicans “have moved so far right they’re unrecognizable,” Democratic state Sen. Fabian Doñate noted that Lombardo’s most recent Republican predecessor, Gov. Brian Sandoval, ruled out calling the National Guard to help round up undocumented people when Trump made a similar request during his first administration.
The “Trump-Lombardo agenda has fractured families and already negatively impacted Nevada’s tourism-dependent economy,” said the Nevada Immigration Coalition in a statement responding to Lombardo’s decision to deploy the National Guard.
“It’s shameful that Lombardo has bent the knee to Trump,” the statement added.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lombardo-DSC01395-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 13:58:46.357555

(Lynn Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Flint Hills Trail State Park, a 93-mile path that carves through grasslands and prairie, earned an induction in the national Rails to Trails Conservancy’s hall of fame.
The trail beat out two others in Florida and Utah by a landslide, with 80% of the vote, according to an announcement from the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
“The Flint Hills Trail isn’t just a path across Kansas,” said Jeffrey Bender, a region supervisor for the department. “It’s a journey through the essence of Kansas — through the land, the cultures and the endeavors of the communities.”
The trail is one of the longest rail-trails in the United States, and the longest in Kansas. It will eventually stretch 118 miles from Osawatomie to Herington. Rail-trails are multi-use paths converted from unused railway corridors.
It is the second Kansas stretch to be inducted into the Rails to Trails hall of fame. The Prairie Spirit Trail was the first major rail-to-trail in Kansas and was added to the hall of fame in 2011 during its 15th anniversary month. The 51-mile trail connects to the Flint Hills Trail, running from Ottawa to Iola.

The Kansas Legislature designated the Flint Hills Trail as a state park in 2018. In 2020, the U.S. Department of the Interior recognized it as a National Recreation Trail. In 2022, Kansas received nearly $25 million in federal grant funds to improve more than 40 miles of trail.
Ryan Chao, president of the conservancy, said in a news release that the Flint Hills Trail “has catalyzed the state’s trail economy.” 
“This trail stands out as a prime example of how trails bring joy, provide cultural and historic connection, and deliver economic opportunity — all critical to quality of life across America,” Chao said.

The conservancy advocates for the creation of rail-trails across the United States. One of its major projects includes the Great American Rail Trail, a still-in-progress path that will eventually span the country from Washington, D.C., to Washington state.
Flint Hills Trail users can walk, bike, hike and horseback ride on the trail. Portions are accessible by wheelchair.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said the induction was an honor and “testament to the natural beauty of our state and the commitment of Kansans who have worked to preserve it.”

When there’s a maternal health emergency, Jessica Wheat springs into action.
Alongside a group of specialized health providers at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Wheat works fast to make sure patients are able to have their babies delivered safely or their children given critical treatment at the Level III neonatal intensive care unit on site.
“We have just an abundance of resources, and people that know what they’re doing,” the labor and delivery nurse said.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

That abundance is coming to an end. Last month, HCA Midwest Health, which owns Research Medical Center, announced it was closing its obstetrics program and NICU. The umbrella company that runs HCA Midwest Health, which oversees multiple hospitals and related sites of care in nearly two dozen states, cited declining births at the hospital as part of its reasons for the closure.
Wheat is worried about the implications for local patients who often struggle to find transportation even across Kansas City. But she’s also concerned about the rural patients outside of the metro area.
“We tend to get smaller hospitals that will Life Flight bleeding moms or moms who are breech or moms who are having a hypertensive crisis,” she said. “We can do the emergency C-section — a lot of smaller hospitals do not have those capabilities. The farther they have to go, the more at risk they’re going to be for complications, even death.”
The availability of obstetrics care in America has been dwindling for years. That could accelerate now, as hospital leaders across the country warn that President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income Americans, could leave pregnant people in rural communities with vanishingly few options for medical care.
Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals, especially in rural areas, which often see a larger portion of Medicaid patients. Nationwide, the program pays for about 40% of all births. With financial hits looming, hospitals are primed to close maternity wards first, and rural areas are particularly vulnerable.
“This is going to have an enormous impact,” said Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people. “Already we’re seeing OB deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”
For years, hospitals facing financial pressure have shuttered maternity wards. Between 2010 and 2022, more than 500 hospitals across the country dropped obstetrics, per a recent study that also shows more than half of rural counties now have no hospital-based obstetric services. A report from the advocacy group March of Dimes found that 1 in 3 U.S. counties had no OBGYN at all.

There are numerous reasons for the recent closures, ranging from declining births to difficulties hiring local providers. But the biggest issue is financial: Hospitals typically don’t earn enough from labor and delivery to cover the cost. Now, cuts to Medicaid — which will further cut hospital revenues and increase their share of uncompensated care — threaten to strain finances further.
“I do have a lot of concern that we’ll continue to see labor and delivery units close in rural hospitals and potentially even at an accelerated rate, as hospitals feel greater strain due to cuts in the bill,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association.
The National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, a consulting firm, estimated in June that the proposed Medicaid cuts over 10 years could reach almost $70 billion just for rural hospitals. Nearly half of all children and 1 in 5 adults in rural communities are enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program. The health insurance plan also pays hospitals less for the same services than private insurance does.
“When rural hospitals say, ‘We have these big Medicaid cuts, how do we deal with that shortfall?’ the OB units are going to be first on the chopping block,” said Jamie Daw, an associate professor of health policy at Columbia University.
One analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonpartisan organization that supports policies such as equal pay and access to health care, suggests that the new cuts to Medicaid put almost 150 rural hospitals with maternity services at risk of serious downsizing or closing altogether.
The changes to Medicaid — including cumbersome new paperwork requirements for people insured through the program, and cuts to some of the taxes used to finance state Medicaid programs — largely won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. But already, hospitals are preparing for huge reductions in services, and pointing to labor and delivery as one of their most vulnerable offerings.
Michigan-based Trinity Health operates five hospitals that include maternity services. Hospital leaders are deeply concerned about service cuts that would make it harder for pregnant patients to get appropriate medical care, said Dr. Sharon O’Leary, an OBGYN and the organization’s chief data analytics and chief equity officer.
When patients have to travel further for prenatal care, they are more likely to cut the number of doctors’ visits or to receive no prenatal care at all. Studies over the past several years have shown that obstetrics unit closures — and increased travel time for pregnant patients — result in higher rates of pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and low birth weight.
“Our biggest fear is that as women lose coverage that they will not seek prenatal care,” O’Leary said.
The consequences are likely to be heightened in areas that are already underserved, and where birth outcomes are worse: rural parts of the country, and, in particular, large swaths of the South.

“While we are concerned about the impact the bill will have on all hospital services, we are particularly concerned about its impact on labor and delivery services,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
Already, rural areas have seen access to reproductive care dwindling, particularly in the past three years, since the fall of Roe v. Wade allowed states to outlaw abortion. Preliminary data shows that medical residents for OBGYN are applying in smaller numbers to states with abortion bans and a recent study in the medical journal JAMA, the first to assess the relationship between abortion bans and provider availability, found that in Idaho, the number of OBGYNs fell by 35 percent between August 2022 — when the state implemented its near-total ban — and December 2024.
Abortion ban states, which are largely in the South, also have higher rural populations, worse birth outcomes and larger shares of hospitals at risk of closure.
“It’s an additional trend — on top of this piece of the general financial pressure  — that’s going to also affect predominantly rural Southern communities,” Daw said. “It seems like a perfect storm of these concurrent trends really really affecting access to care.”
If hospitals reduce their pregnancy-related offerings, few alternatives will be able to fill in the gap. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began withholding millions of dollars in family planning grants through Title X, the federal program that supports family planning services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood, a major provider of services that include cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, is also one of the largest Title X providers. Most Planned Parenthood clinics are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The federal budget and tax law also includes a provision that would cut federal Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, though that policy has since been blocked by a federal court ruling. In recent weeks, several clinics have announced their plans to close.
“You have to think of them as related,” Daw said. “It’s definitely not helpful to have all of these changes happening at the same time and really undermining the safety net for reproductive-aged women.”
Cochran-McClain said when a provider with a background in obstetrics care leaves a rural town or city, that impacts health services more broadly: Often, that provider was also providing contraception, general gynecological care and routine screenings.
“It’s so interconnected. While we’re talking specifically about labor, delivery and pregnancy, it can have an impact more broadly on access to women’s health in rural communities,” she said. “It’s been a rough couple of years before all of this, so it just feels like it’s a worsening trend in terms of overall access.”
The closure at Research Medical Center in Kansas City — where its obstetrics program is scheduled to close down in early September — also shows that even when a person in a rural area is forced to travel greater distances into a city setting for specialized care, those services aren’t guaranteed.
Wheat and other affected nurses at Research Medical Center, where they are represented by National Nurses United, said HCA Midwest Health has not provided enough information about the logistics of winding down services. Will the rest of the hospital, including its ICU unit, take emergency patients who need labor and delivery services? Or will the remaining staff in other areas of the hospital get specialized training?
HCA Midwest Health, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The 19th, said in a statement to a media outlet that it is working with area health providers to ensure patients have other delivery options.
Wheat has lined up another nursing job in labor and delivery with a different hospital system. In her text group chats with other impacted staff, there is a sense of sadness. She believes the obstetrics-related health providers will find other work, even if it means even more gas mileage to get to a new job. But Wheat keeps thinking about what’s to come for the patients.
“I’m emotionally exhausted. It is hard,” she said. “We’re just grieving for the community at this point, because we know they’re going to have a lot of issues after we’re gone.”

If the party chooses him at its nominating convention next year, Terrence Davis could face Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson in the general election.
Johnson was elected in 2022, and has announced her intention to seek reelection.
Secretary of state apologizes for sharing list labeling thousands as public assistance applicants

In South Dakota, the secretary of state oversees elections, maintains voter registration records, and catalogs and manages campaign finance reporting for state office-seekers and political action committees. It also catalogs businesses and corporate filings, among other duties.
Davis, a Sioux Falls resident and Tennessee native, sent an announcement on his candidacy this week. The married father of one spent a year working for the South Dakota Highway Patrol, from 2021-2022, and another five working as a state trooper in Tennessee. He currently works for East River Legal Services in Sioux Falls, and is pursuing a doctoral degree in law and public policy through Liberty University.
He pledged to bring “transparency” and “accountability” to the office, and to deliver “more efficient, accessible services with the respect South Dakotans deserve.” Davis’ announcement also said he would make voting “both secure and accessible, especially for rural communities.”
“When people deny elections, fail to protect your privacy, they silence your voice. Incompetence is just as dangerous — it threatens our democracy and the future of South Dakota,” Davis said in his news release.
The quote does not name Johnson, but references criticisms of her work in office and statements made prior to taking it.
During the 2022 election, Johnson declined to say if the results of the 2020 presidential election, won by Joe Biden, were fair and legitimate.
Last month, Johnson’s office publicly released a list of registered voters that included confidential information on how they registered, including during applications for public assistance programs. The voter rolls were made available at no cost to the public pursuant to a state law that took effect July 1, but Johnson, after reporting by Searchlight and other media, apologized for including the confidential information and retracted it from the database.
Johnson did not immediately return emails requesting comment on Davis’ criticisms.

Mike Dunleavy has named Janelle Earls, the official in charge of the Alaska Department of Revenue’s operating budget, as the acting head of the department.
Earls will replace — at least temporarily — Adam Crum, who announced his resignation last week. Crum was scheduled to end his state service at the end of the day Friday.
As acting commissioner, Earls will also take Crum’s seat on the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. Board of Trustees.
Earls declined a request for an interview on Friday and did not answer a list of emailed questions. 
According to information released by the governor’s office, Earls has worked for the state of Alaska for more than 20 years, mostly with the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, which has since been split into two separate agencies.
She joined the Department of Revenue in May 2024 and lives in Juneau with her husband, three daughters and two grandchildren, according to the announcement.
In a brief written statement, she thanked Dunleavy “for placing his trust in me to manage the department and its numerous responsibilities during this important transition period.”
Earls will serve as acting commissioner until the governor picks a permanent replacement.
Dunleavy is term-limited and not eligible to run for re-election, meaning that his pick will serve only until December 2026, when the new governor picks commissioners.
That new governor may keep existing commissioners, but governors traditionally install new agency heads.

Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, joined demonstrators outside the U.S. Supreme Court on May 15 to protest the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, as justices heard a challenge to the order. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Maryland ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that would have denied citizenship to any baby born in the U.S. after February unless at least one of the parents is a citizen.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to  block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide stays.
But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions if the lawsuits were class-action suits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected by the executive order. Which is what Boardman did Thursday
Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit. But she identified a nationwide class of children born on U.S. soil who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order,” an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”
She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or have children who were born in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.
While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government to temporarily extending the practice of birthright citizenship that has been recognized in the U.S. for well over a century.

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should restrict her injunction just to Maryland.
“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.
A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned. But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.
“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women.
The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.
The order was swiftly challenges and three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.
Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.
Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.
Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”
She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision, but predicts that the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.
“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all. putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law and it is going to remain the law.”

(Photo courtesy of Friends of the Everglades/Ralph Awrood)Further construction at the Everglades deportation facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz” must be halted for at least two weeks, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
The center, located on an old airport runway surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, will continue to operate and process immigrants, however.
“We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, in a news release.
The two-week restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams comes as the court considers a preliminary injunction against the facility.
“Today’s ruling by an activist judge will have no impact on immigration enforcement in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts,” Alex Lanfranconi, a Gov. Ron DeSantis spokesperson, posted to social media Thursday afternoon.
The injunction stops filling, paving, new lights, and new infrastructure.
DeSantis previously claimed construction at the facility was temporary and all operations would be carried out using portable units.
Environmental advocacy groups and the Miccosukee Tribe joined together to oppose construction, including pavement laid despite DeSantis’ claims.
“This facility is not only a threat to one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in the country,” Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in a news release.
“It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources. Constructed in direct conflict with the Everglades restoration efforts supported by taxpayers for decades, this project represents both environmental negligence and human rights violations.”
There was a hearing Wednesday about the restraining order.
Plaintiffs including Friends of the Everglades argued the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.
Williams took over the case after Judge Jose Martinez recused himself.
The center has been controversial, sparking this and other lawsuits with Democratic lawmakers strongly speaking out against it.
“It’s a relief that the court stepped in to protect the Everglades’ sensitive waters, starry skies, and vulnerable creatures from further harm while we continue our case,” said Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’re ready to press forward and put a stop to this despicable plan for good.”
The center has generated national headlines. President Donald Trump visited the facility last month and the Republican Party of Florida is using the center’s moniker on merchandise while immigrant advocacy groups speak out against conditions inside the facility.
“The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people,” Talbert Cypress, Cchairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida said in the news release.
“While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to stand for our culture, our sovereignty, and the Everglades.”

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.
The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.
Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

(Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)With groundwater in parts of eastern Washington declining at an alarming rate, a new study confirms which areas are most vulnerable to the problem and could help set clearer goals for recovery efforts.
The Washington State University study evaluated groundwater levels throughout the Washington portion of the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System, which spans areas of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, and supplies up to a third of the region’s irrigation water.
Researchers found that the Odessa region and the Yakima Basin in eastern Washington are seeing groundwater levels drop by at least 2 to 3 feet per year. The declines in those areas are primarily attributed to a combination of groundwater overuse and climate variability. 
“This gives a quantitative target of how much water needs to be either put back into the ground or needs to be managed around to bring us back to some sort of steady condition,” said Sasha McLarty, study author and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Washington State University. 
The Washington state Department of Ecology estimates that groundwater supplies drinking water to over 60% of Washington residents. 
Most municipalities have groundwater wells, and rural residents typically have wells on their properties, according to Jaime Short, section manager for the department’s Eastern Regional Office. 
In eastern Washington, Short said, groundwater is primarily used for irrigated agriculture. 
The Odessa region showed the most significant groundwater level decreases over the largest geographic area in Washington. 
The study notes that groundwater is the main water supply for the Odessa area. 
If groundwater levels continue to decrease at their current rate, the Odessa region will likely lose 10% of accessible groundwater by 2040 and 50% within the next 70 years, according to the study. 
The Yakima Basin showed steep declines in the deepest aquifer layer, making it more difficult to address the groundwater loss, McLarty said. 
The study confirms what the Department of Ecology and local stakeholders have known for decades, said Department of Ecology hydrogeologist Chris Beard.  
“Where it’s declining, it’s been declining for a long time,” Beard said. 
In general, communities in areas where groundwater levels are dropping have already initiated efforts to mitigate and reverse the decline, Beard said. 
The Department of Ecology and communities that depend on the Odessa Subarea Aquifer have been aware of declining groundwater levels since the 1960s, according to Smith. 
A consortium of state, local and federal partners has been working since 2013 on a project to swap groundwater with surface water supplies from the Columbia River for agricultural users, so they can eventually stop using their wells. 
The Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program secured nearly $45 million in this year’s capital budget to build a new irrigation system.
The project has so far eliminated the use of 16 wells and conserved 5.3 billion gallons of water annually in the Odessa Subarea Aquifer. 
In the Yakima Basin, state, federal, tribal, business, and community organizations partnered in 2009 to develop the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan, which established a 30-year resource management strategy for the basin. 
Of the 15 subareas in Washington included in the study, 12 showed groundwater levels dropping every year, while three — Spokane, the Lower Snake River and Klickitat — were found to be gaining water. 
The positive trends in those areas are primarily due to active management and monitoring efforts, according to McLarty.
While communities that know they’re losing groundwater have taken action to mitigate that loss, there are significant gaps in groundwater level data around the state. 
“Our groundwater data measurements are actually pretty clustered in certain areas, so there are large parts of the state where we simply don’t have data,” Short said. 
Most of those data gaps are in areas that are not heavily populated, according to Short. 
Filling in those data gaps so researchers can track groundwater trends statewide over time is a goal for the Department of Ecology, Short said. The Washington State University study was part of the ongoing effort to do so.
It emerged from a legislatively-mandated project established in 2006, which calls for an estimate of current and future water supply and demand to be collected every five years. 
This year’s study was the first to incorporate an observation-based analysis across the whole Columbia Basin Aquifer, McLarty said.

Progressives and voting rights advocates are divided on whether California and New York should fight the Texas power grab by gerrymandering their own states, creating more safe Democratic seats, even if that means undermining fair maps and the authority of those states’ nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
In Wisconsin, which just got out from under one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the U.S., and the impenetrable, outsized Republican majorities in the state Legislature it protected for a decade and a half, this issue hits particularly close to home.
It’s head-spinning to hear arguments for Democratic counter-gerrymandering in other states from the same people in Wisconsin who were recently crying out for fair maps. 
If Democrats are going to mount a serious challenge to the fascist takeover of our country by Trump and his minions, it’s hard to see how ceding the moral high ground and running roughshod over the principle that the will of the majority of voters should prevail is going to help. 










If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law. 


I get that it’s more satisfying to imagine a quick fix to the fascist takeover of every branch of government than to listen to a lot of vague talk about long-term plans to rebuild democracy. After all, election deniers and the architects of the Jan. 6 attack are now running the federal government, demanding access to voter lists across the country and deploying the FBI to arrest political opponents, including the Texas Democrats who’ve fled their state to stall the gerrymandering scheme there. 
But here in Wisconsin, where we’ve just finally beaten back the most gerrymandered map in the country, it’s depressing to imagine Democrats abandoning the high ground and scrambling to do exactly what Republicans did when they controlled all three branches of government, attempting to lock in permanent political control against the will of the people.
If we want democracy, fairness, and the rule of law, we need to champion, well, democracy, fairness and the rule of law. 
In this most extreme political moment, with every public institution and the continued existence of U.S. democracy in doubt, I understand why the long view frustrates people. The emergency is now. I understand that many voters want to see Democrats “fight fire with fire,” as Newsom put it.
But consider this: Republicans control more state legislatures (28 Republican versus 18 controlled by Democrats) and have trifecta control of all branches of government in more states (23 all-GOP states versus 15 all-Democratic). JD Vance just launched a tour of Republican states to encourage more mid-decade gerrymandering. And Trump wants to hold a new census for the purpose of redefining who can vote. Even if Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul succeed in gerrymandering California and New York, Democrats are not likely to win the nationwide redistricting war.
Meanwhile, democracy will be the first casualty of that war. California and New York would have to suspend the work of their nonpartisan redistricting commissions — the gold standard for fair, nonpartisan map-drawing — and take back partisan control of the process in order to carry out their threats. If they succeed, it is beyond unlikely that the politicians who pull off that short-term victory will ever cede back their power over the voting maps to the nonpartisan commissions again.
On a deeper level, the Democratic gerrymandering fantasy takes the whole movement to oppose Trump in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of building grassroots support to counter an unpopular, authoritarian leader, it rigs the system to benefit a party whose whole problem is that it has lost the broad, popular support it needs to win elections and create a better, more enlightened government. 
Instead of trying to rig the maps to ensure a Democratic House majority in the next election, Democrats need to focus on winning elections and flipping seats in areas of the rural and industrial Midwest that were once reliably blue but have turned deep red.
To do that they need to make the case that health care, education and an adequate social safety net are bedrock rights in the richest nation on earth, and that we should not be giving tax breaks to billionaires by taking food out of the mouths of hungry children. 
They need to offer something to the farmers and factory workers and disaffected voters in rural and urban areas alike that is clearly different and better than the hate, corruption, and a determination to run roughshod over democracy that Republicans offer.
In Wisconsin, voting rights groups have been working on a campaign to push through a constitutional amendment modeled on one in our neighboring state of Michigan, to make sure that our voting maps are never again drawn up by partisan legislators.
That’s the kind of grassroots fight that helped Wisconsin finally overcome Republican gerrymandering. One important aspect of the fair maps movement is the way it engaged citizens to feel like participants, not spectators, in democracy, and to find their common interests instead of focusing on the politics of division. This, not more politicians in safe seats who don’t have to listen to voters, is what we need right now. 
The battle to beat back fascism does not turn on a handful of Democrats in protected districts. It turns on an organized uprising by the majority of people in the U.S. who are willing to join together despite their differences because they are sick and tired of having their democracy stolen from them, along with their health, safety, opportunity and hope. There’s no short cut to leading that fight.

(Arielle Zionts/KFF Health News)EKALAKA, Mont. — There was no doctor on-site when a patient arrived in early June at the emergency room in the small hospital at the intersection of two dirt roads in this town of 400 residents.
There never is.
Dahl Memorial’s three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. So, she made a call for a medical plane to fly the patient to treatment at Montana’s most advanced hospital. Dowdy also called out medications and doses needed to stabilize the patient as a paramedic and nurses administered the drugs, inserted IV lines, and measured vital signs.
Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.
A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. Like Dahl Memorial, more than 90% were in low-volume or critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small, rural hospitals.

The results come from the 82% of hospitals that responded to a survey sent to all emergency departments in the country, except those operated by the federal government. The study is the first of its kind so there isn’t proof that such staffing arrangements are increasing, said Carlos Camargo, the lead author and a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common.
Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn’t without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians’ extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them.
The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation.
Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP.
“It’s important that folks in those areas have equal access to high-quality emergency care to the greatest extent possible,” Haddock said.
Other health care providers and organizations say advanced-practice providers with the right experience and support are capable of overseeing ERs. And they say mandating that a physician be on site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can’t afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors.
“In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,” said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs.
“I’m not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said.

Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn’t unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup.
The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments.
But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. In Montana it was 46%, the third-highest rate.
None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Neither does Wyoming or Idaho.
But Sanford Health, which bills itself as “the largest rural health system in the United States,” is launching an emergency medicine residency in the region. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based program is intended to boost the ranks of rural emergency doctors in those states, the residency director said in a news release.
Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state’s northeast. Working in such a rural area has given him nuanced views on whether states should require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs.
Adelman said he supports such laws only where it’s feasible, like in Virginia. He said the state’s emergency physicians’ organization pushed for the law only after doing research that made it confident that the requirement wouldn’t shutter any rural hospitals.
Camargo said some doctors say that if lawmakers are going to require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs, they need to pay to help hospitals implement it.
Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn’t possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren’t refraining just to save money.
He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state’s hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. The report was part of a mandated process to improve the state’s troubled health care system.
Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians.
Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Few NPs have emergency certification, an analysis found.
Planned Parenthood to close Louisiana clinics; Landry, Murrill applaud news

The Society of Emergency Medicine PAs outlines training and experience PAs should have before practicing in rural areas or without on-site doctors.
Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night.
Haddock said ACEP wouldn’t want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded.
Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms.
She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said.
She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn’t enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways.
Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn’t had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there’s a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. Other rural hospitals, he noted, may have physicians either as permanent staff who leave after a few years or contract workers who fly in for a few weeks at a time.
People eating at Ekalaka’s sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital’s clinic all told KFF Health News that they’ve been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers.
Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who’ve been treated for more serious problems.
“We’ve got to have this facility here because this facility saves a lot of lives,” Bruski said.

(Douglas Rissing/Getty Images)As dissatisfaction with the two-party system grows in the United States, the idea of an alternative, however unlikely, gains traction. Elon Musk’s recent call for an America Party may be unserious, but it speaks to something real.
Surveys consistently show that millions of American voters feel they lack real choices. They believe the two major parties don’t reflect their values, and they are exhausted by the constant polarization.
The bigger question isn’t whether Musk succeeds. As a public policy scholar, I think it’s why the U.S. political system is so hostile to new voices and ideas in the first place.
 
Why third parties rarely succeed
If he follows through on his idea, can Musk’s America Party actually take off? Probably not. History isn’t on his side.
That’s because the U.S. political system is structurally rigged against third parties, with deeply entrenched legal and procedural barriers that make it nearly impossible for new parties to gain traction.
In most states, getting a new party on the ballot is a formidable task. It involves gathering thousands of signatures, meeting stringent deadlines and complying with obscure filing requirements.
Even if a party gets on the ballot in one state, replicating that effort nationally is extremely difficult. Each state has different laws, deadlines, signature requirements and legal demands.
Ballot access, campaign finance, news media coverage and election rules overwhelmingly favor the existing Republican and Democratic parties. Even the Federal Election Commission is designed for partisan deadlock, with an even number of members from each of the two major parties.
In a 2025 article on election administration in America, my colleagues and I analyzed all 50 state election codes. We found widespread legal and administrative barriers that systematically exclude independents and minor parties.
In 45 states, only major party members can serve on election boards, local or state bodies responsible for overseeing the administration of elections. In 27 states, judges must be registered with a major party. Campaign finance laws, access to voter data and registration rules also tilt the field to the major parties.
These structural barriers exist in both red and blue states. We found no statistical correlation between partisan leanings and these restrictions. That’s telling. It suggests that both parties, regardless of their ideological differences, are united in protecting their duopoly.
 
The founders’ warning
This entrenched two-party control runs contrary to the vision of the U.S. Constitution’s framers, who intentionally excluded political parties from the founding document.
This was no accident. The founders viewed parties as “factions” that had no legitimate place in the republic.
George Washington in 1796 warned that parties would inflame animosity and that the nation could not do enough to protect itself from this. John Adams worried that “a division of the republic into two great parties … is to be dreaded as the great political evil.” Likewise, Alexander Hamilton feared parties as “the most fatal disease” of government and hoped America could dispense of such groups.
 
An appetite for alternatives
Enter Elon Musk. His suggestion to create the America Party taps directly into a growing national frustration with the two-party entrenchment.
Public trust in major political parties is at historic lows, particularly among young voters and independents, who do not identify with any major party and may register as “no party preference,” “unaffiliated” or “independent” depending on state laws.
Despite Musk being widely unpopular, prone to conspiracy theories and exhibiting erratic and unpredictable politics, his proposal resonates with many Americans. An October 2024 poll found that 58% of U.S. adults say a third party is needed.
Additionally, the number of American voters identifying as politically independent continues to exceed each of the major political parties.
 
What do Americans really want?
Even if Musk never follows through, the idea of a new party highlights how undemocratic U.S. elections have become. It opens the door to conversations about reforms that give independents and third parties a fair shot and reflects the growing demand for alternatives to the two-party system.
Voters are frustrated by limited choices that fail to capture their full range of political views.
There are models to learn from. Most democracies use a nonpartisan election administration and don’t let political parties control the rules.
In the U.S., partisans referee contests in which members of their party directly compete. That conflict of interest would be unacceptable in business or sports. So why is it tolerated in elections?
Structural reforms and designs have been implemented to varying degrees in the U.S. with a goal of making democracy more responsive, fair, transparent and representative.
Reforms such as open primaries, which allow voters of any party affiliation to participate in any party’s primary election, proportional representation in places such as Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Portland, Oregon, where political parties gain seats in proportion to the number of votes they receive, and independent redistricting commissions have helped create more competitive electoral districts by reducing partisan gerrymandering.
So, too, have ranked-choice voting and fusion voting. In ranked-choice voting, voters rank candidates by preference. If no one gets a majority, the lowest-ranked candidates are eliminated and votes are redistributed until someone wins. In fusion voting, multiple political parties can endorse the same candidate, who then appears on the ballot under each endorsing party’s line.
However, implementation of such reforms has been limited. Opposition to these reforms by the Democratic and Republican parties has, in many cases, been fierce.
 
It’s the system
The two-party system has insulated itself from competition.
The consequence is that today America has an impenetrable two-party system, the very scenario the framers and reformers feared most. Rather than focusing solely on Musk’s ambitions, the more pressing question is how to build an electoral system that reflects a modern, diverse democracy.
If Americans want more choices, and polling suggests they do, then they may want to examine the legal and procedural barriers that lock in the current system, which fails to address and accommodate their political preferences.

Fortunately, she has drawn up a list to help get us started.","The U.S. population is aging, and Maryland's is aging at a slightly faster pace, and state officials need to take steps now to be prepared, writes Allison Ciborowski. (Photo by Getty Images)The recent article, “Maryland aging slightly faster than U.S. as a whole,” underscores a reality that those of us working in aging services have long anticipated. As the CEO of LeadingAge Maryland, a not-for-profit association representing over 150 organizations who provide housing, care, and services to more than 20,000 older Marylanders every year, I see the challenges — and opportunities — daily.
While Maryland has made meaningful strides to prepare for this demographic shift, more is needed, particularly as federal funding cuts threaten critical support like housing, nutrition, and community services. Gov. Wes Moore’s Longevity Ready Maryland Initiative offers a promising blueprint by promoting a whole-of-government, cross sector approach to aging policy.
We must reframe aging policy as cross-generational. When we invest in safe housing, accessible transportation, resilient communities, and better care systems we’re not just helping older adults, we’re building a more livable state for everyone. To be proactive, we must act with urgency and vision to ensure older Marylanders — and all Marylanders — can age well with health, dignity and purpose.
As the proportion of Marylanders 65 and older continues to grow, we urge policymakers, community leaders, and residents to focus on these critical priorities:

Recognize the economic power of aging: Older adults are not a burden — they are contributors to Maryland’s economy as workers, volunteers, caregivers and consumers. With smart policy, we can grow Maryland’s “longevity economy.”

Fully implement and fund the Longevity Ready Maryland recommendations: Ensure every state agency coordinates efforts to support Marylanders across the lifespan, and not just at certain points in time.
Accelerate the development of affordable, accessible senior housing, particularly in rural and underserved areas: The newly released Maryland Housing Needs Assessment highlights the growing number of older adults in Maryland as well as the challenges facing low-income older adult renters. An estimated 55% of this population is housing-cost burdened, compared to only 12% of older adult homeowners. Maryland’s Department of Housing and Community Development could designate part of the state’s Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program funds for age-restricted developments that would provide more affordable rental options and offer coordinated on-site services. Outcomes for older adults vary widely by race, income and geography. Rural and underserved communities lack access to housing, care and transportation. A true longevity strategy must emphasize rural and underserved areas.
Support family caregivers: They are the invisible backbone of the long-term care system, and would benefit from respite, education and financial resources.
Address the direct care workforce crisis: Remove barriers to accessing education and licensure, ensuring sufficient state Medicaid rate increases to support increased wages and benefits, and strengthening transportation, child care and housing support for caregivers.
Expand home- and community-based services, like PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly): Such programs reduce reliance on institutional care. PACE provides comprehensive health care services to eligible seniors in the comfort of their own home, versus living in a nursing home. Lifting arbitrary caps (like the 200-person limit per site) and opening more opportunities for community-based aging innovations further reduces reliance on institutional care.
Bridge the digital divide: Many older Marylanders remain excluded from telehealth, benefit enrollment and even basic internet access. A comprehensive aging strategy must include digital literacy and broadband access as core components.
Leverage Maryland’s innovation ecosystem: Our state is home to world-class research universities, tech hubs and health systems. Maryland should lead in developing and testing new models of care, workforce development, and aging-in-place technology.
Include older adults in climate resilience planning: Aging Marylanders face rising risks from extreme weather and natural disasters. Emergency management, housing, and public health planning must explicitly account for the vulnerabilities of older populations.

Maryland has the infrastructure, talent, and political will to become a national model for aging well. What we need now is coordinated action, sustainable funding and a shared vision that embraces aging and longevity as an opportunity — not a liability.
We can rise to meet this moment with tenacity and collaboration. Together, we can show the nation what it means to truly embrace longevity — and what it means to lead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1397344056-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 04:57:07.533409

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)An increasing number of people with developmental disabilities are falling through the cracks of Medicaid, going months without health care coverage because the state can’t keep pace with new applications and wrongful termination appeals.
Concrete numbers are hard to come by, but providers and developmental disability advocates attest to several dozen cases where recipients are left waiting to hear back from Medicaid officials about their coverage after submitting a new application or challenging what they believe are erroneous Medicaid terminations
“Some participants, because of the backlog of scheduling cases to be heard, are waiting six months, eight months, an entire year to get resolved,” said Randi Ames, managing attorney for Disability Rights Maryland, which has been helping frustrated families and Medicaid recipients through various administrative hurdles.
Between limited staffing within the Maryland Department of Health and inadequate communication between branches of the agency, people with developmental disabilities are falling through the cracks and losing Medicaid coverage for crucial services.
“I know they’re aware of this,” Ames said of state officials. “They’re trying to work toward certain solutions, but we’re at that impasse where it’s just not happening quickly enough and people are being harmed.”
Ames and other advocates suspect that there are probably many more cases across Maryland, and her organization is considering legal action if those administrative delays continue.
The Department of Health did not respond to several requests for interview, though said in a written statement that agency is “working in partnership with stakeholders and providers to enhance and improve the process for these complex Medicaid eligibility reviews.”
  Disability Rights Maryland has been advocating for clients to get Medicaid coverage amid administrative hurdles at the Department of Health. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“People with developmental disabilities and the families and providers that care for them deserve accessible services and supports,” the department statement said. “It is a top priority of the Maryland Department of Health to continually improve the systems and processes for Medicaid waiver programs that provide services and supports to applicants, participants, and community providers.”
At issue are Medicaid waivers that allow people with developmental disabilities to get a wide variety of services, from live-in caregiver support to transportation, respite care, employment services and more.
Those waivers are jointly funded by state and federal governments, with each responsible for roughly 50% of the funding. The state is responsible for administering the program.
Each year, waiver recipients must prove to state health officials they are still financially eligible and still need coverage for their disability, in a process known as “redetermination.”
Over the last few years, the Department of Health and the Developmental Disabilities Administration have been struggling to pull out of several controversies while undergoing leadership changes and attempting to fill vacancies within those departments.
The Department of Health was also stung during the 2025 legislative session, as lawmakers made budget cuts to help close a $3 billion deficit. Those cuts included $164 million in fiscal 2026 from the Developmental Disabilities Administration, an agency that was experiencing unsustainable growth in enrollment and spending.
Despite the agency’s financial challenges, Ames believes that the backlog of application determinations is not “budget motivated.”
“Unfortunately, I think prior to the pandemic, the system was not great — but it was kind of functioning,” she said. Ames believes that the problems were exacerbated after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the state had to determine whether 1.8 million Maryland Medicaid recipients, many added to the rolls during the pandemic, were still eligible in 2023, in a process known as the “Medicaid unwinding.”
She noted that during this time, the department lost experienced staff and added newer employees who had to learn the complex Medicaid determination process.
‘Erroneous’ disability waiver terminations stoke anger, confusion for family members

“When you don’t have the appropriate staff, if you have staff that is not knowledgeable or trained, it all starts to build up and cause this backlog,” Ames said.
Meanwhile, the health department’s top Medicaid and health care financing officer Ryan Moran is leaving the position this month for a top health care job in Washington state.
Providers taking on ‘uncompensated care’
The sudden loss of coverage is also taking a toll on providers of developmental disability services, many of whom have clients who have been receiving Medicaid care for years. Many providers have been pulling from reserves to continue that critical care for clients while they wait for coverage issues to be resolved.
The providers, many of them nonprofits, have been dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars into what may end up as “uncompensated care” while they work to get clients reinstated.
“The deficits, the uncompensated care, ranges from, maybe the lowest being $100,000 to the highest being around $7 million,” said Ande Kolp, executive director of The Arc Maryland. She noted that most, if not all, of the nine Arc facilities across the state have struggled with clients falling off Medicaid.
“It just kind of speaks to the continued chaos,” Kolp said.
David Erving, CEO of Makom, a nonprofit that provides residential options for people with disabilities, said that he’s noticed “a different level of responsiveness” from the state over the last two years when trying to resolve eligibility issues with his clients.
“Resolving these issues has historically always been very, very expeditious and very, very collaborative with our partners at the state, and we’ve seen some changes to that dynamic,” Erving said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Erving said that some of his clients over the past year and a half were disenrolled from Medicaid due to a variety of “procedural terminations,” meaning that for one reason or another, the application for coverage renewal did not get processed — or people whose “Medicaid redeterminations did not go smoothly,” in Erving’s words.
Erving said his agency has provided more than $1 million in services for a handful of clients who lost Medicaid waivers over the past 16 months.
His most significant case was that of a 65-year-old man with Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s who lost his waiver status in February 2024. Makom continued providing care for the man as the facility worked to reinstate his Medicaid eligibility, until he died last month.
Erving said that, because of the man’s age, disability and significant health needs, Makom provided more than $650,000 in unreimbursed services during the man’s gap in coverage. He believes the department owes Makom for the services provided that would have been covered if the man was still on the Medicaid waiver.
The reasons people “fall off” of Medicaid vary.
Some providers reported issues with the health department’s mail notifications for annual renewals, meaning that families of the Medicaid recipient don’t know when to send over the application for redetermination.
Another common problem is when a recipient’s income appears “above the asset limit,” meaning they have a higher balance in their accounts than is allowed, even if it’s just by a couple dollars at the end of the month. They have to spend those extra dollars down to maintain coverage.
For these reasons and more, waiver recipients can be disenrolled from Medicaid, even if their financial situation and their needs have not changed. Those who would otherwise still qualify are supposed to have 120 days to appeal the termination and get reinstated.
Audit: DDA failed to collect nearly $119 million after shift to new payment system

It’s not unusual for there to be a lapse in coverage while these issues are worked out. Providers continue services and expect to be reimbursed when the client’s Medicaid is restored. But as Erving and other providers note, it’s taking longer to correct those issues.
Daria Cervantes, CEO for The Arc Montgomery County, says that about 50 out of 100 Medicaid waiver recipients in their community living program are in similar situations.
“The number continues to grow as people continue to go through the process and fall out of the waiver for our community living or residential program,” Cervantes said. “The fact that half the people in our community living program are out of the waiver, that’s extremely significant for us.”
Other administrative hurdles occur with new applicants. Ames described a client of hers who received disability services from the state school system, but had to apply for a Medicaid waiver as he aged out of school. His family had submitted an application, she said, but it’s “taking months and months to get that transition over.”
She said another client applied for a Medicaid waiver but never heard whether it was accepted. After Ames reached out to the department, she learned that the agency had not started the approval process at all until she called for an update.
Laura Howell, CEO for the Maryland Association of Community Services, says it’s hard to judge the scale of how many waiver recipients are stuck in this administrative limbo.
That said, Howell believes that officials within the health department seem interested addressing some of the concerns identified in the “complex” Medicaid redetermination process, though it is not clear what the path to fixing it will look like.
“We appreciate that the department is engaging in discussions with us,” Howell said. “But we continue to have a lot of questions about how this will be addressed and how we’ll make sure that people don’t have gaps in services and that community providers are paid as appropriate for these lifeline services that they provide.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_nov19_selfdirected_disabilityrally2_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-09 02:56:34.130399

Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, joined demonstrators outside the U.S. Supreme Court on May 15 to protest the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, as justices heard a challenge to the order. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Greenbelt ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that would have denied citizenship to any baby born in the U.S. after February unless at least one of the parents is a citizen.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to  block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide stays.
But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions if the lawsuits were class-action suits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected by the executive order. Which is what Boardman did Thursday
Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit. But she identified a nationwide class of children born on U.S. soil who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order,” an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”
She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or have children who were born in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.
While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government to temporarily extending the practice of birthright citizenship that has been recognized in the U.S. for well over a century.

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should restrict her injunction just to Maryland.
“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.
A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned. But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.
“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women.
The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.
The order was swiftly challenges and three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.
Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.
Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.
Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”
She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision, but predicts that the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.
“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all. putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law and it is going to remain the law.”

Brown/Maryland Matters)Editor’s note: Yesterday and today, Maryland Matters is offering a preview of the newest edition of the Almanac of American Politics, the classic political reference book for political junkies.
For more than five decades, the Almanac of American Politics has set the standard for political reference books. In September, the Almanac will be publishing its 2026 edition, with more than 2,000 pages offering fully updated chapters on all 435 House members and their districts, all 100 senators, all 50 states and governors, and much more.
Below are excerpts from the new chapters in the 2026 Almanac on the state of Maryland, written by Louis Jacobson — a senior correspondent for PolitiFact, a contributor to eight editions of the Almanac and, this year, its chief author — and Lou Peck, a co-founder of Maryland Matters and a senior author of the Almanac.
More than a year before the 2022 primary election, Democrat Wes Moore launched his campaign for Maryland governor as a political outsider who hadn’t sought elected office. Early polls put him in the low single digits, but Moore presented a compelling résumé — Rhodes scholar, Afghanistan War veteran, bestselling author and CEO of a large antipoverty foundation — with a charismatic personality and a stump style to match. He became only the third Black person to win a U.S. gubernatorial election since the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era, and the first in Maryland.
Westley Watende Omari Moore was born in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Takoma Park. Moore was just 3 when his father, a news anchor for a Washington radio station, died in front of him because of a misdiagnosed case of acute epiglottitis, a rare virus that causes the air passages to the lungs to shut down. Moore’s mother, an immigrant from Jamaica, moved him and his two sisters to live with her parents in the Bronx, New York. The neighborhood in which they resided suffered from crime and drug use; Joy Moore worked several jobs so her son could enroll at Riverdale Country School, a private school in an upscale Bronx neighborhood.
At the school, Moore was a C student and had behavior problems, prompting his mother to enroll him in Pennsylvania’s Valley Forge Military Academy when he was 12; her parents mortgaged their house to help pay the tuition. At first, Moore was miserable, but his seven years at the academy put him on a successful trajectory. He became first captain in command of 800 cadets and graduated with an associate degree. He then earned his bachelor’s degree at Johns Hopkins University, won a Rhodes scholarship, and earned a master’s in international relations from Oxford University.

Moore was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon graduation from Valley Forge and remained a U.S. Army Reservist until 2014. In 2005, he was called to active duty, serving with the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan and rising to captain.
Moore became a White House fellow at the State Department, then spent five years in New York as an investment banker with Citibank. During this period, he wrote and published a book entitled “The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates,” which told his own story and that of a man with the same name and similar age from Baltimore who is serving a life sentence for killing a police officer.
The future governor also started his own production company to generate programming for several TV networks, including the Oprah Winfrey Network, on which he hosted a show. Winfrey, a former local TV news anchor in Baltimore, helped to push “The Other Wes Moore” onto bestseller lists in 2010 and, more than a decade later, delivered an influential endorsement of Moore in the gubernatorial primary’s closing weeks.
From 2017 to 2021, Moore served as CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization addressing poverty in New York City. He also appeared frequently as a commentator on cable news. He announced his candidacy for Maryland governor after rejecting entreaties to run for Congress or Baltimore mayor when openings arose. Early polling in the gubernatorial race showed two initial frontrunners: four-term state Comptroller Peter Franchot and former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, who had run for governor four years earlier, largely because of name identification.
Leveraging his extensive and varied background, Moore scored a major political breakthrough in early 2022, when the first campaign disclosure reports were filed. He reported an eye-popping haul of $4.8 million, far outdistancing two former members of President Barack Obama’s Cabinet: ex-Labor Secretary Tom Perez, also a former Democratic National Committee chair,with $2.7 million, and former Education Secretary John King, with $2.5 million.
This helped Moore secure a March 2022 endorsement from Baker’s successor as Prince George’s executive, Angela Alsobrooks. (Moore returned the favor a year and a half later, helping get Alsobrooks elected as Maryland’s first Black U.S. senator.) Alsobrooks’ backing in the primary was crucial in majority-Black Prince George’s County, the state’s second most populous county. Moore added momentum with endorsements from establishment figures in the state Democratic Party, including then-U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and key legislative leaders.
Baker dropped out before the July primary, citing a lack of money, and King, the third Black candidate in the primary, struggled, finishing sixth in the 10-candidate field. Ultimately, Moore edged out the heavily union-backed Perez, 32%-30%, or about 15,000 votes. Franchot finished third with 21 percent.
It was the third straight gubernatorial election in which Democrats had put forward a Black nominee in Maryland — a state one-third Black — but Moore was the first one to succeed. Moore downplayed the precedent-setting prospect of his election, choosing instead to emphasize a series of lofty policy goals. “We’re not running to make history,” he said repeatedly. “We have a unique opportunity to make child poverty history. We have a unique opportunity to make the racial wealth gap history.”
As Democrats united around Moore, the Trump-backed candidate, hard-right delegate Dan Cox, won the Republican primary, defeating Kelly Schulz, a candidate endorsed by term-limited Gov. Larry Hogan as more electable, 52%-43%. After the primary, Hogan publicly dismissed Cox as a “QAnon whack job” and refused to support him. On Election Day, Moore overwhelmed Cox, 64.5%-32% — the biggest landslide in a Maryland gubernatorial election in more than three decades.

Beginning in the campaign and stretching afterward, Moore faced charges he’d embellished his résumé and failed to correct the record. One involved reports that Moore, on at least two occasions, had not recanted statements during television appearances that he had received the Army’s Bronze Star, for meritorious service in combat zones, His commanding officer had approved the medal but, partly because of paperwork glitches, he had never received it. During his governorship, in August 2024, the New York Times uncovered evidence that Moore had claimed to have received the Bronze Star while applying for a White House fellowship in 2006.
Moore told the Times he had “made an honest mistake by including something because my commanding officer thought it was a good idea.” Moore finally received the award in December 2024 at a private ceremony at the governor’s mansion.
In office, Moore pursued several progressive initiatives. He signed one executive order issuing pardons for more than 175,000 marijuana convictions, and another declaring the state a sanctuary for individuals seeking, receiving or providing gender-affirming care without being prosecuted under another state’s laws. Inspired by his military background, Moore won legislative approval of an increased tax break for veterans, albeit in watered-down form. Another priority for Moore, a “Service Year Option” for recent high school graduates, won enactment, but at a level well below what he had proposed as a candidate — 200 slots in the first year, rising to 2,000 in 2026.
On the economy, Moore was cautious about using tax increases to close deficits. Slower economic growth in Maryland had left Moore with a nearly $3 billion budget deficit for fiscal 2026, with projections for a $6.2 billion hole by fiscal 2030. This posed obstacles both for the state’s existing commitments and Moore’s expansive agenda, which include moving to 100% carbon emissions-free energy over the next decade. In the 2024 legislative session, Moore aligned himself with Senate Democrats to oppose several aggressive tax increases pushed by House Democrats.
In March 2024, Moore entered the national spotlight when a huge cargo ship rammed into and toppled Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge. Moore grappled with the economic and human recovery, including the idling of 15,000 port workers for nearly three months.
“This is not a Baltimore catastrophe, not a Maryland catastrophe. This is a national economic catastrophe,” Moore said. He lobbied more than 150 members of Congress for recovery funding. After lobbying from Maryland’s congressional delegation, Congress included full federal funding for a new Key Bridge, at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. Those costs are currently pegged at $2 billion, but are subject to change.

Moore has sought to diversify Maryland’s economy into such sectors as artificial intelligence and offshore wind. He aimed to move away from relying on the federal government, which accounts for about 6% of the jobs in Maryland, plus another 10% when federal contractors are counted. Donald Trump’s election in 2024 threatened to reduce those numbers, and also scuttle the FBI’s 2023 announced move to Maryland — with FBI leadership announcing in July that it was abandoning a Maryland site for new headquarters in downtown Washington.
Heading toward fiscal 2026, Moore proposed to close two-thirds of the $3 billion budget gap he was facing with spending cuts, with the rest coming from tax and fee increases. His plan targeted the 18% of Marylanders earning more than $500,000 annually, while proposing to give two-thirds of taxpayers some relief. His positioning on tax policy spoke to political concerns: Republican Larry Hogan, who preceded Moore, won two terms in a blue state by capitalizing on voter fatigue over tax hikes instituted by Gov. Martin O’Malley, Hogan’s Democratic predecessor. Hogan, despite a loss to Alsobrooks in the 2024 Senate race, has worked to remain visible politically and speculation arose that he could vie for his old job by challenging Moore in 2026.
Moore, who is in his mid-40s, attracted chatter as a future presidential contender. He’s been coy, vowing during the 2022 gubernatorial race to serve all eight years he’d be allowed in Annapolis. Nevertheless, his frequent out-of-state travels, including as a surrogate for Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, fueled speculation about a 2028 presidential bid, which would come during a potential second gubernatorial term.

(File photo courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)A police officer is dead after a gunman opened fire in Atlanta as the work day wrapped up Friday, apparently targeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention main campus.
Bullet damage was seen in the walls and windows of buildings on the CDC campus. A suspect is dead, according to Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum.
“We at CDC are heartbroken by today’s attack on our Roybal Campus, which remains on lockdown as authorities investigate the shooting,” CDC’s director Susan Monarez said in a statement late Friday night. “A courageous local law enforcement officer gave their life, and another was injured, after a gunman opened fire on at least four CDC buildings.”
Police said the suspect opened fire shortly before 5 p.m. Friday from a building in Emory Point, a mixed-use development near Emory University and the CDC. The officer who died was shot while responding to the scene and died of his injuries at a hospital.
Nearby residents reported fear and chaos as businesses went into lockdown and residents sheltered in place. More than 90 young children were in a day care center on the CDC campus during the attack. Police said no children were harmed and teachers were working to reunite the kids with anxious parents at a nearby school into Friday night.
Friday’s attack comes on the heels of a Wednesday shooting at Fort Stewart near Savannah, where an Army sergeant opened fire, injuring five fellow soldiers. Other high-profile shootings have rocked Georgia in recent years, including last year’s attack at Apalachee High School in Winder, which claimed four lives.
State Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Lilburn Democrat and microbiology professor at Emory, said she wasn’t on campus at the time of the attack but learned about it through a text message sent to students and faculty notifying them of the active shooter situation and advising them to “Run. Hide. Fight.”
“As a professor at Emory University, and a parent, I am horrified that this took place in a place where I recently stood with CDC protesters, next to a day care center full of small children, and just weeks before thousands of students are set to return for the first day of classes,” said Clark, who is also running for Congress in Georgia’s 13th District.
Clark called on her colleagues to support legislation aimed at improving gun safety.
“The Legislature could do so much with the political courage and political will to fight gun violence,” she said. “While we don’t know much about the shooter and about the motives, what we do know is ‘guns everywhere’ policies do not make our communities safer, and also put the lives of law enforcement at risk.”
In the wake of Apalachee and other high-profile shootings, Georgia Democrats have called for tightening regulations, including by requiring gun owners to safely secure firearms. In recent years,  Georgia’s GOP-dominated Legislature has moved toward loosening gun laws, including ending a state permit requirement to carry concealed handguns in 2022.
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running for governor next year, recently signed on in support of a lawsuit against Savannah Mayor Van Johnson over a law penalizing gun owners from leaving firearms in unlocked cars.
State Sen. Elena Parent, an Atlanta Democrat whose district includes Emory and the CDC, indicated Democrats in the Legislature will resume pushing for tighter gun regulations when lawmakers reconvene in January.
“The availability of guns has endangered the lives of thousands of people at the CDC and Emory, which is exactly why I have fought so hard for gun reform,” she said in a statement. “Unfortunately, Republicans have been an obstacle as they endanger our communities by passing laws to make guns more prevalent and deadly in the state of Georgia.”
“This is yet another stark reminder of why we must continue to fight for gun safety legislation,” she added.
In public statements, the state’s top Republican lawmakers focused on honoring the bravery of the first responders who stopped the shooters in the two recent attacks.
“Twice this week, deranged criminals have targeted innocent Georgians,” Gov. Brian Kemp said in a social media post shortly after Friday’s attack. “Each time, brave first responders rushed toward the danger to subdue the shooter and save lives, reminding us of just how crucial they are. Marty, the girls, and I are thankful for all those who answer the call to serve and who protect their fellow Georgians. We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers, along with those harmed this evening near the CDC Center.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.
The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
“Thousands of Maine people stood to benefit from lower energy bills delivered by the Solar for All program,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office. “Terminating this funding doesn’t help Maine people, it only hurts them.”
In April 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded Maine $62 million through the federal Solar for All program that supports the state’s clean energy workforce, in addition to expanding solar to low-income households. Just last month, the EPA approved the state’s plan to implement the program so benefits could reach Mainers by 2026, according to a Friday news release from the Governor’s Energy Office. 
However, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on social media  that the new law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.
“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”
Solar for All was projected to help over 20,000 low-income Maine households save between $380 and $1,400 annually on their energy bills through incentives for rooftop solar and a new community solar and storage program. 
Solar can lower costs and improve reliability by reducing demand on the electrical grid, lowering wholesale energy prices and circumventing the need for costly transmission and distribution investments, the state energy office noted. It also lessens the reliance on fossil fuels, which come with volatile price tags while exacerbating climate change.
Part of the funding was also earmarked to support workforce training for over 700 Maine residents in essential building trades including electrical work, construction, maintenance and repair. 
“Canceling the program deprives Maine of access to affordable solar, energy storage, and the skilled electricians, installers, and construction workers needed to meet our energy and economic needs now and in the future,” Burgess said. 
He added that the state remains committed to the program and will explore options to preserve it. His office is consulting with the Office of the Maine Attorney General on next steps. 
When Maine received its Solar for All grant in 2024, the state had 977 megawatts of solar energy installed, an increase from the 62 megawatts that were in place five years earlier. The majority of solar arrays in Maine are small-scale, less than 5 megawatts.
Democrats created the Solar for All fund as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the law they passed without any GOP support in either chamber and President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.
The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Asked about the program’s termination, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins told the Portland Press Herald it “would be unfortunate news,” but that underscored the risk of including such a grant program in a “completely partisan bill.”
“Not one Republican voted for the Inflation Reduction Act that included this grant program,” Collins reportedly said. “While it is no surprise now that control of the White House has changed that the new administration would consider terminating this IRA program, my staff has asked the EPA for additional information.”

U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate issued his order in response to an emergency request from Mayor John Horhn. Wingate said it was a “temporary humanitarian measure.”

“Judge Wingate’s decision to turn the water back on gives us the critical time we need to help our neighbors get to a safe place,” Horhn said in a statement.
In the days before taps ran dry at Blossom, the city’s privately operated water utility company, JXN Water, had indicated water shutoffs were possible but not imminent at Blossom and other complexes with large overdue bills.
Many of Blossom’s low-income residents receive housing vouchers. Their water service is included as part of the rent they pay.
The apartments’ owner, Tony Little of Monroe, Louisiana, told Mississippi Today that he has a longstanding dispute with JXN Water over the amount the utility company says he owes.
Wingate wrote Friday that his ruling does not reduce or forgive the unpaid bills at Blossom.
“This Court recognizes that the property’s owners are in arrears on water bills and that condemnation proceedings may be ongoing,” Wingate wrote. “This Court further recognizes that to reactivate water for Blossom Apartments despite the Court’s warnings of a potential shutoff and Blossom Apartments’ continued nonpayment would be windfall to Blossom Apartments if it is allowed to receive free water under these circumstances.”
Wingate wrote that the absence of potable water “creates immediate and significant public health risks, depriving residents of the ability to meet their basic needs for drinking, cooking, sanitation, and hygiene.”
Horhn’s statement said the mayor, who took office July 1, has been communicating with Mississippi Home Corp., which has agreed to provide financial help for people to move out of Blossom. That includes down payments for new apartments, the first month’s rent and relocation expenses. The money will be delivered through Stewpot Community Services, which is coordinating relocation and support services.

Region 6 Housing Authority is speeding up the availability of vouchers to help Blossom residents find different housing, and Jackson Housing Authority is providing caseworker support and housing placement, the mayor said.
Stewpot CEO Jill Buckley has organized a relocation assistance meeting for Blossom residents at 5 p.m. Tuesday at Stewpot headquarters.
Blossom Apartments is a 72-unit property initially built in 2004 through low-income housing tax credits administered by the state to offer affordable rents to Jackson residents.
Earlier this year, JXN Water released a list of multi-family accounts that had more than $100,000 in unpaid water fees. Blossom was on the list.
JXN Water said it has tried to work with Little on Blossom’s overdue bills. The utility company said he has leaks on the property and it has offered a bill adjustment if those leaks are repaired.

Terry Rice (R) listen to Arkansas Board of Election Commissioner Director Chris Madison discuss a new voter registration rule during a legislative committee meeting on May 2, 2024. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A co-chair of the Joint Performance Review Committee said it would hold a hearing to allow the public to speak on the proposed Franklin County prison, in response to a request for an investigation into the site selection.
However, Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs, said he and his fellow co-chair Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, had ruled out actually conducting an investigation.
The plans for the still-unscheduled hearing come after more than 1,200 people signed an online petition in support of an investigation.
“We do not do investigations. That would have to be the AG [Attorney General] or somebody like that,” Cozart said. “We’ll let them come in and talk as long as they stay in the parameters, don’t get too far out. We’ll hear what they’ve got to say.”
The petition says the “highly secretive” prison project “threatens to upend the lives of no less that 605 Arkansan families” living near the site, and “represents government overreach at the highest levels and pays no respect to either local control or the most basic levels of human respect.”

JPR – Citizen Complaint – Franklin County Prison 
The request, dated July 23, asked the committee to investigate the process for selecting the Franklin County site. Opponents of the prison argue the 815-acre site near Charleston is unable to support the 3,000-bed prison envisioned by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
The state unveiled its plans for the prison site late last year, taking the local community, elected officials and members of the state Board of Corrections by surprise.
The lack of engagement from state officials prior to and after the site selection has frustrated locals. The nearby town of Ozark passed a resolution in February opposing the prison, noting that it would “put a great and severe strain” on the city’s budget, as well as its infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Board of Corrections member Lee Watson wrote to legislators that while he was “acutely aware” of the state’s need for a new prison, he’s seen no evidence that such a large facility is needed to alleviate overcrowding.

The prison divided Republicans in the Senate during this year’s legislative session; a group of senators blocked a $750 million appropriations bill for the prison’s construction five times. The bill died on the Senate floor when the Legislature adjourned in May.
“We kept hearing that, you know, President Pro Tem [Bart Hester] didn’t want to do hearings before session started, because there’d be ample opportunity to investigate and ask questions and testify during session. And that didn’t happen,” said Adam Watson, one of the petition drafters and an outspoken critic of the prison. “We were shut out of every conversation, of every vote. … Joint Budget refused to take comments before they voted.”
Prison appropriation bill remains stuck in Arkansas Senate

When told by the Advocate that Cozart said the Joint Performance Review Committee would have a hearing, but wouldn’t investigate, Watson expressed both frustration and gratitude.
“I’m still trying to walk a fine line of being appreciative for the opportunity to speak with them — I think that’s that’s super helpful — but I’m disappointed that they’re saying that they’re, for whatever reason, not able to go further than that,” Watson said. He said it was a step in the right direction after not being heard at all.
Still, he pointed out that the description of the committee on the Bureau of Legislative Research’s site explicitly says it can conduct investigations. “I would think this is within their scope,” he said.
“This committee makes random and periodic performance reviews of specific governmental programs and agencies” and “conducts investigations into specific problem areas of the administration of state government as may be brought to the attention of the committee,” the website says.
The website also says the committee “serves as a forum for citizens to air their complaints and suggestions regarding the operation of state government” and that it “conducts hearings on citizen complaints and views regarding the operation of state government.”
The petition asks the committee to investigate:

The prison site selection process;
If any standards, rules or best practices were ignored when selecting the site
Whether any legal or ethical guidelines were violated during the selection processes for the contractors working the project
Whether the state is or was violating state spending laws by starting work on the prison project “without sufficient funding”

The request criticizes Department of Corrections staff for allowing “inexperienced state employees” to lead the site selection process instead of relying on Vanir Construction Management’s “expert analysis.”
“As a result, critical due diligence was skipped, key infrastructure and environmental concerns were overlooked, and a deeply flawed site was chosen,” according to the petition, driving up projected costs by “hundreds of millions of dollars.”
The prison is currently expected to cost taxpayers around $850 million. The number is a preliminary estimate, so the price could ultimately change.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In a major departure from decades of state and federal policy, Oklahoma’s top education official said Friday his administration doesn’t plan to administer statewide reading and math tests this school year. 
Instead, state Superintendent Ryan Walters suggested Oklahoma should collect data from benchmark assessments that individual school districts select and purchase from private vendors. Oklahoma would be the first in the nation to replace its statewide exams with a patchwork of district-chosen tests.
The plan requires permission from the U.S. Department of Education, and Walters said he expects a “very, very quick” approval from the Trump administration. The Oklahoma State Department of Education is accepting public comment until Sept. 8 on the idea before submitting its final request to the federal government.
“I was elected to make changes, serious changes,” Walters told Oklahoma Voice. “I have done all that I can to bring the changes into place that the voters demanded. And so, that’s where you’ve seen an overhaul of an education system that was failing our kids.”
If the Trump administration agrees to the plan, Oklahoma could “open the floodgates” for other states to do the same, said Dale Chu, a school policy expert and senior visiting fellow at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a national education think tank. 
State leaders in Texas, for example, also are considering replacing their state testing system.
Federal law requires every state to test their public school students in reading and math from grades 3-8 and once more in high school. These tests are intended to hold schools accountable to providing a quality, equitable education to every student, and they inform families of their children’s academic results.
Oklahoma law similarly mandates that the state Board of Education adopts a statewide system of assessments that complies with federal regulations.

Walters, though, said he doesn’t intend to bring his idea to the state Board of Education for a vote. He said making this change falls within the Education Department’s authority to choose testing vendors and assessment schedules.
“We don’t need a vote from the state board,” Walters said. “We’ve already done everything we need to, so we’re moving forward.”
For several years, Oklahoma’s state tests have found a majority of students performing below their grade level. This was the case last year even after the state lowered the standard for students to meet grade-level targets in reading and math. Test scores are expected to have another downturn this year after state officials again raised expectations for student performance.
Walters said he’s not trying to avoid accountability for state test results. Eliminating these tests could remove a barrier that parents and teachers want out of the way, he said, and benchmark assessments could provide more helpful and timely data instead.
Many Oklahoma districts already use benchmark assessments in addition to the annual state tests. Students take benchmark assessments multiple times a year for more up-to-date information on their academic progress, and their scores are comparable to the millions of children in other states whose schools administer the same exams. 
There is a trade-off, though, Chu said. These benchmark assessments aren’t deliberately aligned with the Oklahoma Academic Standards, which dictate what topics local public schools must teach to students in each subject area.
“This is why I always say all the time there’s no single assessment that can do everything,” Chu said. 
Each state develops its own set of academic standards to dictate what its public schools must teach to students. Their statewide assessments then test students’ knowledge of those standards. 
They also ensure the test scores of every public school and district in Oklahoma are directly comparable.
Chu said he’s not yet seen a statewide assessment system where each individual district, rather than the state, decides which test to take.
“To ensure consistency and comparability and move (the decision) to the district level, I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I haven’t seen a reliable and valid method to do what I’m talking about,” Chu said.
The benchmark system is possible, but implementing it is more complicated than one end-of-year test, said Maria D’Brot, who formerly oversaw state testing and school accountability at Oklahoma’s Education Department. 
Using multiple testing vendors could undermine comparability between districts, she said. Fairness issues could emerge if students don’t have equal access to testing formats, or if students with disabilities don’t get the same accommodations or accessibility tools.
“The success of Oklahoma’s transition will depend on embedding strong psychometric infrastructure, disciplined operations, and fairness safeguards from the outset,” D’Brot said. “Without these, the accountability system risks losing its credibility, jeopardizing federal and state compliance, and failing to deliver fair and actionable information to students, families, and educators.”
Walters said his administration already has the proper infrastructure in place to make the change this year. He said the Education Department will make sure scores from different benchmark tests are evenly compared.
His proposal has faced skepticism from both sides of the political aisle. 
“While we can all agree that the status quo isn’t working, tossing out the tests without thinking through next steps can be short sighted,” said Nellie Tayloe Sanders, education secretary for Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt.

Sanders leads the Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability, a small state board that shares authority over state testing with the Education Department. She said she looks forward to working with the Education Department to “find a path forward to ensure our kids have the skills they need for their futures.”
State lawmakers indicated they want input, too.
“We look forward to continued collaboration with Superintendent Walters and school districts so that any proposed changes to student testing align with state law and provides clear, actionable information on student college and career readiness,” said Rep. Dell Kerbs, R-Shawnee, who leads the House Education Oversight Committee.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said legislative Democrats are open to moving on from state testing, but the timing of Walters’ announcement is “reckless.” 
Many districts are only days away from the first day of school, and some already have welcomed students back to class.
“Absolutely we should have a conversation about what testing is appropriate and when, and we’ve been bringing up that conversation up for years,” Kirt said. “But him doing it this way, I don’t think complies with state law, and it makes us all have to do a bunch of scrambling to figure out what’s happening.”

Gavin Newsom and Texas Democrats jointly promoted California’s plan to redraw congressional lines and offset a redistricting scheme in Texas. The proposed map is expected to be made public next week.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom and Texas Democrats jointly promoted California’s plan to redraw congressional lines and offset a redistricting scheme in Texas. The proposed map is expected to be made public next week.


As pressure mounts for their return, half a dozen Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to stop a Republican-led redistricting scheme traveled to Sacramento on Friday to urge on California’s retaliatory response.
The Texas delegation appeared at the historic governor’s mansion alongside Gov. Gavin Newsom, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top legislative leaders, who publicly endorsed for the first time Newsom’s plan to redraw California congressional lines in the state to favor Democrats. They expect to make the proposed map available next week.
“We are here because we do know that courage is contagious,” Texas state Rep. Ann Johnson said, “and we are here to give hope to others to stand up and be courageous in this moment.”
Nearly the entire Democratic caucus of the Texas Legislature left the state earlier this week to deny Republicans a quorum and prevent them from taking up their redistricting proposal. At the request of President Donald Trump, who is seeking to protect a narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Texas Republicans are advancing a plan that could flip five seats currently held by Democrats.
It’s unclear how long the Democrats will be able to hold out as GOP leaders demand their return. The House has issued civil arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers, who also face $500 fines for each day they are absent, while the FBI is getting involved in tracking them down. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Friday sued to expel 13 of them from office. 
“We take this fight one day at a time. We fight to win today and tomorrow we assess,” said Texas state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, one of the legislators Paxton is seeking to have removed.
This is the second time in two weeks that Newsom has hosted Democratic legislators from Texas at the governor’s mansion as he seeks to drum up public enthusiasm for his redistricting plan. He wants to call a special election on Nov. 4 and ask California voters to replace congressional district lines drawn by the state’s independent commission with a new map crafted to benefit Democrats.
Initial internal polling, shared with state lawmakers in private meetings on Sunday, showed a feeble majority of 52% of California voters in support — enough to win in November, but perhaps not enough to withstand a combative fall campaign that will almost certainly draw national attention and resources.

“I think the voters will approve it. I think the voters understand what’s at stake,” Newsom said Friday. “We live in the most un-Trump state in America.”
Legislature will quickly take up redistricting
With time running short to meet an Aug. 22 statutory deadline for the November special election, California can no longer wait to see if Texas acts. Democratic leaders in California are still finalizing the language and district lines for their proposal, which the Legislature is expected to take up as soon as it returns from summer recess on Aug. 18.
Newsom has said the California redistricting measure will also include trigger language, with the new map only taking effect if Texas or other states redraw district lines before the 2026 midterms.
Sources who were not authorized to speak publicly have told CalMatters the redrawn map broadly aims to shore up Democrats in several swing seats while flipping five Republican-leaning districts to solidly Democratic, offsetting the potential gains in Texas.
It could spell the end for Reps. Doug LaMalfa of Chico, who represents California’s northeastern corner; Kevin Kiley of Rocklin, whose sprawling district runs down the eastern border of the state; Darrell Issa of Escondido, who straddles southern Riverside and eastern San Diego counties; and David Valadao of Hanford and Ken Calvert of Corona, perpetual Democratic targets in the Central Valley and Riverside County, respectively.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas on Friday dismissed criticism from Republicans that the new map has been drawn in secret without input from voters.
“Once these maps are released, voters will have the opportunity to digest these maps, review them for weeks and months leading to this election,” Rivas said. “If there is another state with a more transparent process, where voters will get the ultimate say in these new maps, please let me know what it is.”
As California and Texas accelerate their efforts, other states are still weighing whether to join a national arms race for control of the House. After a visit this week by Vice President J.D. Vance, Indiana’s Republican Gov. Mike Braun was noncommittal about redistricting the state, where Democrats hold two of nine congressional seats.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, who chairs California’s 43-member Democratic House delegation, said Friday that every single one of them supports the redistricting plan.
That includes Pelosi, who accused Trump and congressional Republicans of trying to rig the next election because they cannot defend their agenda and have no winning ideas to present to the American people. She said California was right to fight back to protect democracy.
“We have a responsibility to prove through the night of this Trump administration, the darkness of it all, that our flag is still there, with liberty and justice for all,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080825-Texas-Democrats-Presser-FG-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-08 20:56:11.969191

The last few weeks of summer, heading into Labor Day weekend, can sometimes mean vacations and driving more miles on the road for all people, including teens.
Traffic crashes are the No. 1 cause of death for teens, and the crash rate for teen drivers is disproportionately higher than the share of licensed teen drivers.
In addition to this grim statistic, summer is the riskiest time for teen drivers. The 100 deadliest days represent the period from Memorial Day to Labor Day when the number of fatal crashes involving teen drivers dramatically increases. A third of each year’s teen driver crashes occur during the summer.
We are scholars who research transportation safety and teen driver behavior. Our expertise helps us understand that these 100 days are not just a statistical fluke – they reflect a dangerous intersection of factors such as inexperience and a propensity to take risks.
What makes summer different?
Regardless of the season, some teen drivers engage in risky behaviors that increase their likelihood of a fatal crash, such as getting distracted, driving with friends in the vehicle, driving under the influence, not wearing seat belts and a lack of hazard awareness.
Teens also have more free time in the summer, since most aren’t in school. Combined with the longer days and better weather, teens drive more over the summer. More time on the road means more risk, especially for inexperienced drivers.
Teens may also be more likely to drive after dark during the summer, in comparison to more experienced drivers. But nighttime driving is also when visibility is reduced and crash risks are higher, particularly for teens who haven’t fully developed the skills necessary for night driving. This increased exposure, in addition to teens’ general risky driving tendencies, contributes to the 100 deadliest days for teen drivers.
The increased crash risk for teens over the summer isn’t equally distributed either. Crashes with teen drivers that lead to serious injuries are more likely to occur with male drivers, in rural areas, for those of lower socioeconomic status and for those with disorders, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.
Teaching young drivers
Driver’s education programs are the formal method to teach teen drivers the rules of the road.
In driver’s education programs, teens receive information about driver and road safety though classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction in preparation for the licensing exam. Some states require teens to complete a driver’s education course if they want to receive a license under the age of 18. Of teens who have a license, nearly 80% of them have gone through some form of driver’s education.
Though driver’s education programs can be helpful, their effects are not equally felt. In some states, teens and their guardians must pay out of pocket for driver’s education courses to obtain a license. This makes driver’s education and, as a consequence, obtaining a driver’s license inequitable.
There are also driving school deserts – areas where the poverty rate is 20% or above and there are no behind-the-wheel driver education courses within a 10- to 15-minute drive. This makes driver education courses inaccessible. Many of these driving school deserts happen to be in areas with high populations of minorities.
Over 20 years ago, graduated driver licensing was introduced to reduce teen crash rates. This is a phased licensing system wherein teen drivers are restricted in terms of when, where and with whom they can drive until they turn 18. Such a system allows teens to gradually learn and gain experience with driving over time.
Graduated driver licensing has been implemented in all 50 states, and it has been shown to reduce teen driver crash rates. However, its effectiveness is limited to those who participate in the system. A large number of teens are unlicensed and are of low socioeconomic status. Many of these unlicensed teens forgo the entire process and remain unlicensed but still drive, well into their 20s when the graduated driver licensing restrictions are lifted.
Making summer safer
There are two things people can do to turn the 100 deadliest days into the 100 safest days.
First, it is important that communities offer free supplementary training programs for teen drivers, because becoming a safe and responsible teen driver shouldn’t be limited to those with resources. As one example, in collaboration with industry partners, we have developed a program called Risk-ATTEND. It is a free, online, evidence-based program that teaches teen drivers how to anticipate risks while driving. Our research has shown that programs such as these can improve teen driving skills and may be especially effective for teen drivers in high-poverty areas.
Second, our research has shown that parents and guardians still play an important role in influencing teen driver behavior. Studies show that teens mirror the behaviors they observe: If they see adults text and drive, they’re more likely to do the same.
Once teenagers become old enough to drive, it is also important to establish rules and guidelines about expectations to establish clarity and accountability. Written agreements or checklists can address high-risk conditions such as nighttime driving, driving with other young passengers, phone use and adherence to speed limits.
Systems to help monitor and enforce rules have been shown to be effective in improving teen driver behavior. One such program is Checkpoints, which is a Connecticut-based program in which families agree to limit teen driving during high-risk conditions. Teens face consequences for violating these limits, such as a temporary loss of driving privileges. However, the limits are gradually lifted as they gain driving experience.
More than rules matter
Ultimately, preventing crashes in the summer and beyond extends beyond mere adherence to regulations. Avoiding them fundamentally hinges on cultivating a robust safety culture that emphasizes a collective commitment to risk reduction and continuous improvement in driving practices.
For teens, the summer months present unique challenges and opportunities.
Drawing on best practices, such as training programs, teens can build essential skills in varied conditions before gaining full, unsupervised privileges.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska State Board of Education signed off on steering $80 million in federal and private funding over the next five years to boost literacy for K-12 students.
The eight-member education board Friday unanimously awarded the first two years of a $55 million federal grant to 46 recipients and accepted $25 million in new private funding for a similar purpose from the Sherwood Foundation. Both buckets of funds will be doled out over the next five years. Board members will consider how to spend the private dollars at a future meeting.

Board member Lisa Schonhoff of Bennington called the $80 million “a huge, huge, huge deal, and it is very clear and evident that we are all taking it very seriously.”
She said, “I think that we need to continue, now that we’ve got this money in front of us, to continue asking the tough questions, not going along to get along, but having these really tough conversations with each other and holding each other accountable.”
Focus on accountability
This February, board members voted 7-1 to approve the Nebraska Literacy Project Plan, which includes a goal to boost third grade reading proficiency to 75% by 2030. State reading tests deemed about 59% of third graders proficient in the 2023-24 school year, according to test data released last fall.
“If there’s not accountability, and our kids aren’t reading by 2030, then we need to have some serious conversations with each other,” Schonhoff continued.
In addition to the federal and private dollars, the Legislature, led by former State Sens. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area and Lynne Walz of Fremont, secured $6 million over three years for educational service units to employ regional coaches who will mentor teachers teaching reading to children between 4 years old and third grade — a key time in child development.

Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher confirmed that resources aren’t an issue. He said his department is focused on ensuring students are reading better tomorrow than they are today.
Schnohoff, a classroom teacher for more than 20 years before joining the state board in January, was the lone vote against the Nebraska Literacy Project Plan in February. She had voiced concerns about a focus on “high-quality instructional materials” and worried those materials could get in the way of students reading real books or writing.
The Nebraska Literacy Project Plan also has two other goals: to increase the percentage of K-3 students who meet Nebraska Reading Improvement Act standards and ensure all Nebraska teacher preparation programs implement evidence-based instruction for teachers grounded in the “science of reading.”
‘Everything that we need’
Board Vice President Deb Neary of Omaha called the federal Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grant a “gold standard project” as the Nebraska Department of Education has a vision, plan, science, research, data and professionals.
“We have everything that we need to be successful,” Neary said.
The federal dollars are designed to advance literacy skills for all children from birth to grade 12, and at least 95% of the grant funds must be distributed to eligible entities. Awardees can receive more funds if they serve more students.
  State Board of Education member Sherry Jones. Aug. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Funding must be allocated at different ages or grade levels as follows:

15% to entities serving birth to kindergarten ($8.26 million).
40% to entities serving grades K-5 ($22.02 million).
40% to entities serving grades 6-12 ($22.02 million).


Board member Sherry Jones said she was disappointed with those funding distributions because there was more demand for the K-5 age bracket than funding. Meanwhile, applicants seeking funds to help students in the other age brackets were fully funded. Jones said the K-5 age group is a critical time to teach reading.
“This is, I believe, an example where state and local decision making would have been better, in my opinion, than the federal government dictating to us how we should use this $55 million,” Jones said.
Nebraska Department of Education staff, responding to a question from Board President Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte, said it’s possible that schools denied funding can reapply in the future. It’s also possible that some allocated dollars won’t be spent, with an expectation that some funds might be redistributed to new applicants or previous applicants who succeeded.
Public-private partnership
The Sherwood Foundation funds, which Neary praised as an “extraordinary” investment, will create the “Nebraska Literacy Leadership Network.” The network plans to convene up to 75 instructional leaders and higher education partners so they can better coach classroom teachers on how to teach literacy.

State Education Department staff pursued the public-private partnership with the Sherwood nonprofit after identifying a potential gap in school leader training and support.
“This isn’t a small project or amount,” Neary said. “This is a really big deal, and it is going to be transformational.”
Schonhoff said the professional development is critical, highlighting “no strings attached” compared to the federal dollars that she initially opposed but ultimately supported.
‘Thank you’
When Tegtmeier was elected president in 2024, she pledged to make literacy a focus, and on Friday, she credited state lawmakers, department staff, teachers and more for joining the efforts.

She credited early work done in 2017 and 2018 by former State Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks of Lincoln and Linehan. The two lawmakers studied literacy and dyslexia, including tours of multiple school districts, which led to new support for reading and dyslexia, including the Nebraska Reading Improvement Act, which allows students to be placed on reading improvement plans for focused interventions and support.
Tegtmeier said the state Education Department also hired a literacy director as well as a new deputy commissioner in the last year. She said many teachers spent parts of the summer attending related trainings and workshops.
Another supporter, Tegtimer said, is Gov. Jim Pillen, whose office reached out Thursday to express Pillen’s support for the Sherwood dollars ahead of Friday’s meeting.
Said Tegtmeier: “To everyone who has picked up their oar and chosen to row with us, I say, ‘Thank you.’”

Article Summary

A judge has denied former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan’s motion to remain free as the legal appeal process plays out for both his corruption conviction and prison sentence.
Madigan is due to report to a yet-to-be-named federal prison in mid-October after his February convictions on 10 corruption charges, including bribery.
The former Democratic power player has hired a well-known team of appellate attorneys to handle his appeal, while those convicted of bribing him are also preparing to argue their case to higher court.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO — A federal judge on Friday denied former Illinois Speaker Michael Madigan’s legal arguments that he should remain out of prison while his appeal of both his corruption convictions and 7 ½ year sentence play out.
Madigan is scheduled to report to prison on Oct. 13, though the federal Bureau of Prisons has not yet assigned him a facility. The former speaker, whose 36-year reign in Springfield made him the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history, has already begun the appellate process, though his full arguments aren’t due for another few weeks.
U.S. District Judge John Blakey, who presided over Madigan’s lengthy trial this past fall and winter and sentenced Madigan to his lengthy prison term in June, wrote in a 44-page order Friday that the ex-speaker’s “entire motion rides on routine, and meritless” objections.
“As such, he clings to false hope,” Blakey wrote.
In February, a jury delivered a split verdict for Madigan, convicting him on 10 of 23 corruption-related charges, including bribery and wire fraud. The jury acquitted Madigan on seven counts and deadlocked on another six, but the 10 on which he was convicted involved electric utility Commonwealth Edison and dealings with Chicago alderman-turned-FBI mole Danny Solis, who introduced Madigan to high-powered real estate developers as potential clients for the speaker’s property tax appeals firm.

Blakey wrote that Madigan’s arguments to remain free during his appeal don’t meet the high bar of raising “a substantial question of law or fact.”
The ex-speaker recently hired a team of attorneys who have years of experience arguing at the U.S. Supreme Court. Madigan’s legal strategy centers around the definition of “bribery,” which the high court last summer examined in a case that delayed the former speaker’s case.
Some of those convicted of bribing Madigan, including former ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore and longtime Springfield lobbyist and Madigan confidant Mike McClain, are also planning appeals on the same grounds.
Earlier this summer, Pramaggiore, McClain and the two other members of theso-called “ComEd Four” were sentenced to prison terms ranging from a year and a day to two years for their roles in orchestrating the bribery scheme.

The post Wyoming newspaper owners, staffers race to rescue community news appeared first on WyoFile .","Hope arrived in the form of a caravan winding its way down the dirt road to Marie Hamilton’s home out on the eastern Wyoming prairie where her family’s ranching and farming roots run generations deep. Spotting the unusual amount of traffic from the washroom, the Platte County Record-Times managing editor and reporter went out to the patio.
“I’m confused,” she said, seeing community members and neighbors gathered at her door. The day before Hamilton had suddenly lost her “dream job” reporting on her hometown of Chugwater.
But the mood on the porch didn’t match that news.
“They all have these weird, funny faces,” she recalled, and appeared “super excited.” 
Asking to remain anonymous, they told her that they trusted their local newspapers, so they were collecting donations to make sure Hamilton and two other now unemployed reporters got paid until things got sorted out. 
They told her, “we did this for you girls. Whatever work you do, we want you to get paid,” she said. “I was just bawling.”
The community has rallied behind her and other reporters who are well known for consistently showing up to cover local government meetings and community events. 

Efforts to rescue The Platte County Record-Times and other legacy papers are underway after their Illinois-based parent company closed eight Wyoming newspapers.
The outpouring comes after News Media Corporation announced Wednesday that it was closing its doors immediately and “permanently” — abruptly shuttering the Record-Times in Wheatland and other papers in Torrington, Evanston, Pinedale, Kemmerer, Lusk, Lyman and Guersney. However, efforts are now underway to revive many of the publications that had been owned by the Illinois-based company and to keep the company’s employees.
“We’ve been scrambling the last two days to figure out ways to help,” said Darcie Hoffland, executive director of the state’s newspaper trade group, the Wyoming Press Association, “and that’s not going to stop.”
Hoffland said Friday that other Wyoming newspaper owners are exploring ways to get the papers back up and running.
“I genuinely believe that it will happen,” she said, adding, “There’s a lot of people who care about these communities [and] are working really, really hard to get the job, to get these papers open as quickly as possible.”
‘Tragic timing’
For Chugwater resident Keith Miller, the stakes couldn’t be higher for his community right now, making the loss of the county’s newspaper of record, the Platte County Record-Times, all the more devastating. 
“We are in a battle of possibly transitioning our agricultural lands and heritage to industrial operations,” Miller said in an email to WyoFile. “To some of us, we will die of broken spirits if that happens.”
The Platte County Record-Times has been closely following NextEra Energy’s pursuit of local approval for the Chugwater Wind, Solar and Battery Storage Project. But Wednesday’s abrupt closure left Hamilton without a job or place to publish her ongoing reporting. 
Instead of filing for unemployment, she joined fellow eastern Wyoming newspaper staffers in searching for a solution to keep their longstanding papers of record in production. 
“We’ve got big city issues in small towns. So this is really very tragic timing.”Marie Hamilton
“We’ve got big city issues in small towns,” Hamilton said. “Platte County, Goshen County, is at a crucial point. So this is really very tragic timing.”
A group has stepped up to figure out how to get the Platte County Record-Times, Torrington Telegram and Lusk Herald back into production. With a deal still in the works, Hamilton said she could not yet disclose potential backers aiming to save the legacy papers. Hamilton and Cali O’Hare, the managing editor of The Pinedale Roundup, said the impacted newspapers on the western side of the state are working separately to salvage their publications.
In the meantime, Hamilton has been able to update the Record-Times’ website with this week’s e-edition and hopes to see a barebones edition printed on schedule next week “to maintain our status” as a newspaper of record.
State law says newspapers must publish an edition at least once a week to be deemed an “official” newspaper and eligible to print legal notices — a coveted source of revenue that’s helped keep Wyoming newspapers afloat.

The Pinedale Roundup is at-risk of breaking its streak. O’Hare was instructed to cancel the Roundup’s Aug. 7 print edition, which had already been reported, edited and designed. She then broke the news of the closures on the paper’s Facebook page and website.
On Friday morning, Hamilton and reporter Lisa Phelps were back at the Wheatland office collecting legal notices and selling hard copies, still in demand among readers of all ages who avoid social media or prefer paging through a physical paper. 
Hamilton had not received her last paycheck, which she had planned to spend on her three sons, ages 11, 13 and 15.
“We were all planning to go back-to-school shopping with our checks,” Hamilton said of herself and fellow employees. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay for back-to-school pants, but I’m still going to push on and figure out how to still protect my community.”
In a Wednesday memo to employees, News Media Corporation CEO J.J. Tompkins said the company would “make all reasonable efforts” to issue final paychecks, while health insurance coverage was terminated immediately.
Hamilton had to call off health appointments for her sons and pay a $25 penalty for canceling within seven days of the appointment.
WyoFile reached out to Tompkins but did not get a response by the time this article was published. Phone calls to the corporate office phone number went to voicemail, which was full.
Swift closures
Eight Wyoming newspapers, with 30 employees, were among about two dozen newspapers across five states suddenly shuttered. In the memo to employees, Tompkins cited “financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an attempt to sell the company…” 
He said the company had explored “every possible avenue” to continue operating, but “reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible.”
Rob Mortimore, who oversaw News Media Corporation’s publications in Wyoming and Nebraska, had informed staff in late July that a potential plan to sell the company to the Alabama-based Carpenter Media Group was no longer in play. However, Mortimore said Wednesday’s sudden shutdown came as a “shock” to him alongside the other employees.
News Media Corporation owned a significant chunk of Wyoming’s legal newspapers — eight of 39. After the news of the closures broke, Hoffland said the Wyoming Press Association immediately heard from other papers asking how they could help.
“They care, and they’re working hard” on a solution, she said.
On Friday morning, Hamilton announced to readers on social media that they could come by and pick up or purchase copies of The Guernsey Gazette and Platte County Record-Times at the Wheatland office. 
“Thank you for the growing commitment and support to your PCRT,” the post read. “Good things are coming. Stay tuned.” 
The newspaper’s landlord, a longtime subscriber, saw the post and came by Friday afternoon to check on the staff and pick up his copy of the Platte County Record-Times.

The council held a make-up meeting in Jackson late Friday afternoon after a virtual session was derailed by hackers last week. Many committee members, including council chair Attorney General Lynn Fitch, were not in attendance.
One of Fitch’s special assistants, Caleb Pracht, and her Chief of Staff Michelle Williams provided the council members draft versions of committee rules, funding priorities and materials for applicants before the meeting started.
The new draft documents included some changes the members suggested from the last completed meeting, such as a scoring rubric and definitions for qualified applications. The grants would be available to organizations interested in addressing opioid addiction.
The members made a series of amendments to the procedures, such as adding language to encourage applications from underserved and under-resourced communities, encouraging applicants to submit matching funds and emphasizing that these dollars go toward helping Mississippians.
Pracht told council members he will spend the weekend making approved changes and hopes to make the application live on Monday. Williams said the grant materials will be accessible on Fitch’s website.
While the state Legislature has tasked the council with soliciting applications, reviewing them and making funding recommendations by early December, council members worried about whether they could meet that deadline and mused about asking lawmakers to push it back. Committee member Joseph Sclafani, an attorney for Gov. Tate Reeves, asked his peers if they thought all those tasks were doable in four months.
“If it’s not, perhaps we could beg some grace from our legislative members,” he told the council.
Although the council is tasked with developing the grant process quickly, Mississippi is behind most states in distributing its opioid settlement dollars. Every state that borders it has started allocating money.
Williams said Fitch’s office would be reluctant to request more time. But she said the Attorney General and the council are committed to making sure their work would be completed by the 2026 regular legislative session, when the Legislature is expected to approve or deny applications.
“We’re going to do everything we can to make sure they get the recommendations when they’ve asked for them,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/09155555/3X0A7470.jpg,,,2025-08-08 19:56:16.192854

Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an agreement Wednesday between the state’s economic development commission and Israel’s National Technological Innovation Authority, her office announced Friday.
The memorandum of understanding “recogniz[es] the longstanding friendship and shared values between the State of Arkansas and the State of Israel” and expresses the two entities’ mutual goal of “fostering research, development, [and] technological innovation,” according to Friday’s news release.
The agreement “is non-binding and does not create legal or financial obligations” for either party and will be valid for 10 years. Sanders signed the memorandum in Israel’s capital of Jerusalem as part of her trade mission to the Middle Eastern country this week.
Under the agreement, Arkansas and Israel will “support and promote exchanges and visits by delegations and businesses between both entities” and facilitate the exchange of information, attendance of economic development events and cooperative research and development projects.
Such projects would create “technologically innovative products or processes based on new innovative technologies to be commercialized in the global market,” according to the agreement.
“Implementation may include the organization of delegations, technical workshops, joint research initiatives, and investment forums,” the memorandum states.
Sanders has repeatedly expressed support for strengthening the relationship between Arkansas’ defense industry and Israel. In October 2023, Raytheon Technologies and Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense System partnered to build a $33 million missile plant in East Camden.

The missiles are part of Israel’s Iron Dome defense system and Skyhunter, the American equivalent, and production at the South Arkansas plant began this year.
South Arkansas is a hub of defense contracting, and American technology company L3Harris invested in a rocket motor production campus in Camden after Sanders met with company leaders in June. The meeting was part of a trade mission to France and Switzerland, and Sanders’ trip this week is her fifth international trade mission since taking office in January 2023.
Sanders has visited Israel several times throughout her life. Her father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, is the current U.S. ambassador to Israel.
Sanders also visited the United Arab Emirates this week. She met with UAE aerospace companies with the goal of bringing “more foreign investment and jobs to Arkansas,” she announced in July.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-08 22:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,This New Haven haunt has attracted legendary musical acts for 50 years,Dave Collins | The Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/toads-new-haven-bar/,"Toad's Place has featured artists ranging from The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen to Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Cardi B.","NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — Nestled on a narrow, one-way street among Yale University buildings, a pizza joint and an ice cream shop, Toad’s Place looks like a typical haunt for college kids.

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
But inside the modest, two-story building is a veritable museum of paintings and signed photos depicting the head-turning array of artists who’ve played the nightclub over the years:
The Rolling Stones. Bob Dylan. Billy Joel. Bruce Springsteen. U2. The Ramones and Johnny Cash. Rap stars Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Kanye West, Cardi B, Run-D.M.C., Snoop Dogg and Public Enemy. Blues legends B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and John Lee Hooker. And jazz greats Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie and Herbie Hancock.
This year, the New Haven institution is celebrating 50 years in business. And the people who made it happen are reflecting on Toad’s success in attracting so many top acts to a venue with a standing-only capacity of about 1,000.
“You know, I thought it would be good for a few years and then I’d be out doing something else,” said owner Brian Phelps, 71, who started as the club’s manager in 1976. “And then the thing started to happen when some of the big bands started to come here.”
Music and cheap beer fuel success
Original owner Mike Spoerndle initially opened Toad’s Place in January 1975 as a French restaurant with two friends he later bought out. Before that, the building had been a burger and sandwich joint.
But when the restaurant got off to a slow start, Spoerndle had an idea for bringing in more customers, especially students: music, dancing and beer. A Tuesday night promotion with bands and 25-cent brews helped turn the tide.
Among the acts who performed was New Haven-born Michael Bolotin, who would change his name to Michael Bolton and go on to become a Grammy-winning ballad writer and singer.
The gregarious and charismatic Spoerndle, who died in 2011, endeared himself to bands and customers. A local musician he tapped as Toad’s booking agent used his connections to bring in area bands and, later, major blues acts.
Then, in 1977, came a crucial moment. Spoerndle met and befriended concert promoter Jim Koplik, who would bring in many big names to Toad’s over the years, and still does today.
“Mike knew how to make a really great room and Brian knew how to really run a great room,” said Koplik, now president of Live Nation for Connecticut and upstate New York.
A year later, Springsteen stopped by Toad’s to play with the Rhode Island band Beaver Brown after he finished a three-hour show at the nearby New Haven Coliseum.
In 1980, Billy Joel stunned Toad’s by picking it — and several other venues — to record songs for his first live album, “Songs in the Attic.”
That same year, a little-known band from Ireland would play at Toad’s as an opening act. It was among the first shows U2 played in North America. The band played the club two more times in 1981 before hitting it big.
An unforgettable show for $3.01
On a Saturday night in August 1989, Toad’s advertised a performance by a local band, The Sons of Bob, and a celebration of Koplik’s 40th birthday, followed by a dance party.
The admission price: $3.01.
After The Sons of Bob did a half-hour set, Spoerndle and Koplik took the stage.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Spoerndle said.
Koplik followed with, “Please welcome the Rolling Stones!”

The stunned crowd of around 700 erupted as the Stones kicked off an hourlong show with “Start Me Up.”
“Thank you. Good, good, good. We’ve been playing for ourselves the last six weeks,” Mick Jagger told the crowd.
The Stones had been practicing at a former school in Washington, Connecticut, for their upcoming “Steel Wheels” tour — their first in seven years — and had wanted to play a small club as a warmup. The band’s promoter called Koplik, who recommended Toad’s. The band agreed, but insisted on secrecy.
Those at Toad’s kept a lid on it for the most part, but swirling rumors helped pack the club.
Doug Steinschneider, a local musician, was one of those at the venue that night after a friend told him the Stones would be playing. He wasn’t able to get in, but managed to get near a side door where he could see Jagger singing.
“It was amazing!” said Steinschneider. “For being a place where major bands show up, it’s a tiny venue. So you get to see the band in their real element. In other words, you’re not watching a screen.”
A few months later, Bob Dylan’s manager reached out looking for a club where he could warm up for an upcoming tour.
Dylan’s 1990 show at Toad’s sold out in 18 minutes. He played four-plus hours — believed to be his longest performance — beginning with a cover of Joe South’s 1970 song “Walk a Mile in My Shoes” and ending with his own “All Along the Watchtower.”
“That was a good one,” Phelps recalled.
Variety is the key to longevity
Phelps — who bought out Spoerndle’s stake in Toad’s in 1998 — believes the secret to the venue’s longevity has been bringing in acts from different genres, along with events such as dance nights and “battle of the bands”. Rap shows especially draw big crowds, he said.
Naughty by Nature and Public Enemy played Toad’s in 1992. After releasing his first album, Kanye West played there in 2004 with John Legend on keyboards. Drake played Toad’s in 2009, early in his music career. And Snoop Dogg stopped by to perform in 2012 and 2014.
“When you have all these things, all ages, all different styles of music, and you have some dance parties to fill in where you need them, especially during a slow year, it brings enough capital in so that you can stay in business and keep moving forward,” Phelps said.

On a recent night, as local groups took the stage for a battle of the bands contest, many were in awe of playing in the same space where so many legends have performed.
Rook Bazinet, the 22-year-old singer of the Hartford-based emo group Nor Fork, said the band members’ parents told them of all the big acts they’d seen at the New Haven hot spot over the years. Bazinet’s mom had seen Phish there in the ’90s.
“Me, the Stones and Bob Dylan,” Bazinet added. “I’m glad to be on that list.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25130590863338-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

(Courtesy of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association)More and more often, people in the journalism business talk about “news deserts,” those places that have no newspapers or other local news coverage. I always felt sorry for those places. Now I live in one. 
Journalists and people who care about the news were stunned Wednesday when News Media Corp. announced it was closing its newspapers, including four in South Dakota: the Huron Daily Plainsman, The Brookings Register, The Redfield Press and the Moody County Enterprise in Flandreau. 
The sudden closing of those newspapers will make life tougher for subscribers and advertisers, not to mention the employees who are out of work. It’s tough news for me because I have a connection to all four papers. 
Company’s sudden shutdown closes four newspapers in eastern South Dakota

I was raised in Huron. The Plainsman was my hometown paper, not that I paid much attention to it. My love of newspapers was developed later in life. The Huronite, as old-timers have been known to call it, didn’t really get on my radar until my mother-in-law started working there as the secretary to the publisher. At the time, I was the editor of the Milbank Herald Advance. As a rookie editor, it was heady stuff for me when she would slip one of my editorials onto the publisher’s desk to show off what her son-in-law was up to. Bless her heart, sometimes those editorials would be reprinted in the Plainsman. 
My newspaper career started at The Brookings Register where I spent five years selling advertising. It was there that I fell in love with newspapering. I made three attempts to move from the sales department to the newsroom. The third time seemed like the charm. It tells you something about the way people are valued at newspapers in that I had to agree to take a cut in pay to become a reporter. At the time, the paper was owned by Stauffer Communications. Some bean counter at the home office cut the position. 
While I thought my dreams of being a journalist had been crushed, the editor at the Register had other ideas. She had come to Brookings from The Redfield Press and knew that the owners there were having a tough time keeping editors. Their plan was to hire an editor and get that editor coached up on how to sell advertising. Once the editor was adept with a rate card, the owners would move on to another weekly newspaper and complete the process again. Their goal was to own a chain of weekly newspapers. However, they were stuck in Redfield because the news/editorial graduates they were getting from South Dakota State University had no interest in learning how to sell ads. 
I was hired as editor and general manager of The Redfield Press because I already knew how to sell advertising and I had a keen interest in learning about writing and presenting the news. The lessons I learned in Redfield stuck with me my entire professional life. 
From Redfield I went to Milbank and then on to the Capital Journal in Pierre. After stops as a writer for Game, Fish and Parks and University Relations at SDSU, my wife and I retired in Brookings. In retirement, one of the first freelance jobs I had was filling in as the editor at the Enterprise in Flandreau. I’ve been back to Flandreau a few times, filling in again just this past June. 
I’d hate to think that I’m the common denominator as to why these four newspapers closed. It’s more likely that the cause is some sort of corporate mismanagement as anyone could look at the Register or the Enterprise and see that they have plenty of advertising to support their woefully small staffs. 
The evening of Aug. 6, when the internet was roiling with news of the closures, I heard from a Brookings businessman who was incensed at the turn of events. He was an occasional subscriber to the Register. He spends his advertising dollars in the competing shopper. Yet he was angry, as we all should be, at the notion that there is no one in our community chasing and reporting the news.

These closures bring home the fact that the vital job of journalism has to be sustained by the communities that are served by newspapers. Certainly you should subscribe, but there’s more that you can do. Invest your advertising dollars in the publication that’s watching out for your best interests by reporting the news. Frequent the advertisers in the newspaper, telling them that you saw their ad in the local newspaper. 
The template for bringing news back to these four communities has already been created. When the Gannett newspapers in Sioux Falls, Aberdeen and Watertown turned into ghosts of their former selves with shrunken staffs and little or no local news, startup weekly newspapers stepped in to fill the news void. There’s no reason to believe that the same formula won’t work in Brookings, Huron, Redfield or Flandreau. The Dakota Scout of Sioux Falls has already announced plans to expand into Brookings and Flandreau.
We can only hope that someone with more money than sense will try to fill the news voids in Huron and Redfield. For everyone who still has a newspaper in their community, take the time and spend the money to nurture it and help it grow. Do otherwise and you’ll wake up one day to find yourself living in a news desert.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Brookings-Register.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

ICE has stepped up arrests of migrants in Vermont recently, but advocates say the raid marks a new tactic.

Following a monthslong investigation, federal immigration officers performed a targeted raid at Lamell Lumber in Essex on Saturday, arresting several migrant workers.
While U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has accelerated its arrests of migrants in Vermont in recent months, advocates say the raid marks a new tactic. 
“ICE arrests at the workplace are still not the norm,” said Will Lambek with Migrant Justice, a group that advocates for immigrant workers. “Most arrests are conducted in public places, so this is something of a departure from what we are usually seeing.”
According to Lambek, the officers arrested three men. The raid follows an investigation of Lamell Lumber’s employment practices, during which the federal Homeland Security Investigations unit in Burlington allegedly discovered counterfeit documents that led to the arrests.
Federal court records show that two men from Mexico — Alejandro Monfil Carballo, 40, and Artemio Cordova Mendez, 36 — have been accused of reentering the country illegally after being deported. They are currently being held at Northwest State Correctional Facility. 
A judge decided that the men must remain detained at Northwest while they wait for their trials.
The third man who was arrested has not been criminally charged, according to Lambek. He was originally detained in Northwest like the others, but Migrant Justice only became aware of his detention on Tuesday, Lambek said. By then, the man had already been transferred and is currently being held at Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. 
According to Lambek, the man was unable to make a phone call in Vermont and could only alert his family when he was granted a phone call in Massachusetts.The Vermont Department of Corrections didn’t respond to an inquiry about whether the man was allowed to make an initial phone call. As of Thursday afternoon, the man had not been able to contact a lawyer yet, Lambek said.
The investigation and arrests come after lingering strife at the business related to workers’ rights.
On Feb. 7, migrant workers at Lamell Lumber staged a protest claiming the company fired them for demanding higher wages. When they asked to have their jobs back, the company allegedly  offered to rehire them at $14.50 per hour instead of the $16 they were paid before. According to Lambek, the workers involved in the protest took severance pay and left Lamell Lumber.
Monfil Carballo was hired by the company shortly after the protest, Lambek said, whereas Cordova Mendez had been working there longer but was not involved in the February protest.
The investigation began in February when the Homeland Security Investigations unit in Burlington received information indicating that Lamell Lumber employs and provides housing to their workforce through Agri-Placement Services, an employee placement company, according to affidavits submitted by border patrol agent John McGarghan.
In March, HSI submitted a notice of I-9 inspection and subpoena, requiring Lamell Lumber to submit original I-9 forms, which are used to verify identity and employment eligibility. Federal officials also asked for payrolls from January onward, lists of current and terminated employees from December 2024 onward and other personal information on the workers.
As a result of the investigation, HSI said it found fake documents that led to the arrest of the two men.
“This is the first, to our knowledge, set of arrests that followed an I-9 audit,” Lambek said. “In that sense, it is unique.”
Brett Stokes, director of the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at Vermont Law and Graduate School, agreed with Lambek.
“Is it possible that ICE could have been doing this before? Yes, absolutely. But the fact of the matter is they haven’t been,” Stokes said. “I certainly have never heard about it happening in Vermont.”
During the Biden administration, a Deferred Action for Labor Enforcement program allowed people to report workplace violations and abuse without fear of retaliation. Immigrants could request to defer removal and be legally present in the U.S. for limited periods while investigations into the companies moved forward. Many workers benefited from the program, but it was terminated after Trump’s inauguration, Lambek said.

“The threat of retaliation from ICE is something that can create a chilling effect for immigrant workers and prevent them from advocating for their rights and denouncing labor abuses,” Lambek said.
Neither Immigration and Customs Enforcement nor Lamell Lumber responded to requests for comment.
The next court hearing for Monfil Carballo and Cordova Mendez is scheduled for Aug. 18 in Burlington. Since they are facing criminal charges, the two were assigned a public defender.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador also signed the letter, which was was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard. This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter.
According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023. For instance, in 2023, the Idaho Legislature passed, and Gov. Brad Little signed, House Bill 191, which restricts the state from using environmental, social and governance criteria in evaluating contract bids.
“Contract awards, including for public works projects, must be based on competitive pricing, contract requirements and contractor qualifications,” the law’s statement of purpose states. “The state cannot consider unrelated, subjective ethical or sustainability criteria when determining whether a contractor is qualified or a bid is awarded.”
 State attorneys general say ESG hurts competition

Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 23 states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting. The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”

(Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife)A coalition of outdoor sporting groups intend to appeal the decision of a federal judge in Montana made earlier this week that directed the federal government to reconsider whether gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains require additional protections under the Endangered Species Act.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance Foundation, Safari Club International and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation on Wednesday submitted their notice to appeal the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy of Montana to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
“This ruling is the latest string of nonstop litigation by environmental groups seeking to frustrate the original intent of the ESA, which is to recover endangered species and return them to state-based management, not keep them perpetually listed and under the authority of the federal government,” Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President and CEO Kyle Weaver said in a press release. “Whether it’s the wolf or the grizzly bear, once an animal receives ESA protections, it becomes nearly impossible to remove them, even if populations meet recovery criteria over an extended period of time. The ESA needs an adjustment to renew its focus on real species recovery.” 
In Tuesday’s ruling, Molloy vacated a 2024 determination made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that gray wolves in the western United States do not need increased federal protections.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as an endangered species in the contiguous 48 states, except in the Northern Rockies — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington — after management of the species in those regions was given over to the states following Congressional action in 2011.
A coalition of more than 70 environmental and conservation organizations submitted a petition to the federal government in 2021, asking FWS to relist gray wolves in the Northern Rockies, or create a western Distinct Population Segment, or DPS, for the species with added protections.
The coalition argued in its petition, and subsequent lawsuit following FWS’s determination against added protections, that due to concerns that states are using inadequate scientific methods to assess population statistics, harsh political rhetoric and increased mandates in Montana and Idaho to reduce wolf populations, and because wolves do not inhabit the full extent of their historic range — which once broadly comprised the entire western U.S — the species meets the criteria for reconsideration under the ESA.
“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote, adding that the federal government had “failed to use the best available science” in its species analysis.
Molloy’s ruling requires FWS to reevaluate whether gray wolves should receive increased federal protections.
While members of the conservation coalition praised Tuesday’s decision, officials in Montana, which joined the lawsuit as an intervenor-defendant, and Idaho, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government, disagreed with the ruling by an “activist judge.”
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists.”
Price said that if FWS appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks “will be there to support them.”
Price could not be reached before publication about whether the state and FWP would sign on to the current notice of appeal.
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Idaho Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement.
Molloy’s ruling does not currently change the status of gray wolves, which are managed by each state’s respective wildlife agency.
In Montana, where gray wolves number approximately 1,100, FWP has proposed new hunting and trapping regulations for the upcoming wolf season that would set a statewide quota of 500 animals — up from 334 in 2024 — and would significantly increase bag limits allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
Arguments from the coalition in support of its appeal are expected to be filed soon, according to Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation staff.

Leaders of the environmental groups Conservation Voters of New Mexico and New Mexico Wild presented U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, both Democrats, with framed photographs of picturesque New Mexico public lands during a Friday event at Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge. 
Amid all of the other environmental threats that President Donald Trump’s administration poses, from increasing energy extraction, rolling back environmental reviews, or repealing the “roadless rule,” cause for celebration exists due to the removal of a provision in a recent spending bill that mandated the sale of millions of acres of public lands, said Demis Foster, executive director of Conservation Voters of New Mexico. 
“The list just goes on and on and on,” Foster said of the Trump administration’s environmental degradation. “But there really is some light cracking through this unprecedented darkness.”
Stansbury and Heinrich both briefly recounted how a diverse coalition defeated the provision from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that would have mandated the “disposal” of between .5% and .75% of all United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land across the West, which means up to 3.2 million acres or 5,000 square miles.
Both mentioned a deluge of calls from the public as playing vital roles in convincing Republicans to vote against the provision. Heinrich said a coalition from “birdwatchers to bowhunters” mobilized across party lines to oppose the measure, which he said demonstrated to his Republican colleagues in the Senate that touching public lands was deeply unpopular.

“They knew that their voters, their hunters, their fishermen, their hikers, the people that choose to live in their states because of those public lands, wanted nothing to do with this,” Heinrich said. “And so quietly, when the final bill was filed on the floor, there was a big black Sharpie marker through all of those pages.”
Lee said he wanted to sell the public lands to housing developers, citing a nationwide housing shortage. In a brief interview with Source New Mexico after his speech, Heinrich dismissed that explanation as a “pretext” and said the coalition that emerged to save public lands will stay intact.
“It doesn’t matter what the pretext is” going forward, he said. “What a lot of my colleagues learned is that the policy was deeply out of step with the American people, and it didn’t matter where you were on the political spectrum.”

He hopes the same coalition rears its head to fight the Trump administration’s effort to divert funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which purchases land and easements.
 “I hope we can just use this coalition for other things that are deeply popular with the American people, like predicting the Land and Water Conservation Fund,” he said. 
Stansbury told attendees to celebrate themselves for the pressure they put on Congress, and she called for a round of applause for the United States Fish and Wildlife Services employees who were in attendance. Fish and Wildlife manages the Valle de Oro refuge and also has employees across the state, including some who were fired earlier this year. 
“Our federal workforce is under attack,” she said. “That includes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, countless New Mexicans and Americans all across the country to get up every day and put their uniform on and go to work on behalf of the American people, including right here in this wildlife refuge.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0523-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-08-08 18:56:30.096488

Gretchen Whitmer addressed questions from reporters on the state's lagging budget negotiations following the signing of an executive order on health care in Traverse City, Mich. Aug. 8 2025 | Photo By Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceTRAVERSE CITY – Republican Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall’s reported budget alliance with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer might not be so cozy after all.
Whitmer on Friday spoke to reporters in Traverse City following the signing of an executive directive to raise awareness on health care impacts from Republicans’ latest federal budget, giving the governor an opportunity to talk shop on Michigan’s own budget woes.
The Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-led state Senate have yet to come to terms on a budget plan funding the state, its agencies and its K-12 schools. The two chambers blew past the statutory – albeit toothless – deadline to have an agreement reached by July 1, and there is no clear path to reaching a deal in sight.
Hall for months has said that he and Whitmer were aligned on a vision to fund roads and that the issue was the main holdup in the budget fight with Senate Democrats, who at present have a loose plan, at best. But the House has yet to deliver a full budget funding the entire state, giving the Senate little to work with at the negotiating table.
Although Whitmer has been more on the offensive in her approach to get the two chambers together on a roads plan, the executive office has said little about which side it supports in the talks.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Advance asked Whitmer if there was any truth to that, and if she was truly as aligned with House Republicans as Hall has said.
Whitmer brushed the narrative off as political posturing.
“Listen, this is the budget process. I’ve done 20 some budgets in my time as a legislator and now as governor, and they always go this way,” Whitmer said. “This is going a little later than I think any of us want it to, but there’s going to be all sorts of posturing. I am not going to get distracted by posturing.”
Whitmer said she was proud of the work the state has done in its past budgets under her watch, and she was committed to getting a balanced budget done soon that protects people, health care systems, funds roads and ensures competitiveness for good paying jobs.
“Those are my north stars,” Whitmer told the Advance. “I’m not going to play … the games they like to play in Lansing. I just want to get it done.”
Whitmer has been playing harder ball on the roads issue, however.
On Thursday, the governor called on the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity to compile and release data on the impact of the state’s looming road funding cliff, including info on federal funding rollbacks and policies that could have an effect on Michigan’s economy and employment.
The funding cliff is being complicated by the international tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump, which Whitmer said were slowing business growth and raising unemployment – as well as economic uncertainty around the nation.
Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday that a bipartisan roads plan would improve the outlook given that uncertainty.
“With just weeks left to go until our state budget deadline, expiring federal and state resources to fix our infrastructure, and massive national economic uncertainty, Michiganders deserve to know what’s at stake if the legislature does not get a bipartisan roads deal across the finish line,” Whitmer said. “If Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature do not come together to get a roads deal done, we could lose thousands of good-paying jobs and stall dozens of infrastructure projects statewide, creating unsafe driving conditions for families, further straining already crumbling local roads, and jacking up the cost of future fixes.”
On Friday, Whitmer told the Advance that the budget won’t be complete with a clear and unified roads plan.

President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs on countries across the globe took effect this week — a move experts have said will further disrupt trading patterns and increase prices for U.S. consumers on goods from clothes to food to appliances.
The impacts are somewhat complicated for goods imported to the U.S. from Canada, which data shows is by far Vermont’s largest trading partner. Here’s the latest:
Canadian imports to the U.S. now face, broadly, a 35% duty. That’s an increase from the 25% tariffs that had been in effect since March. (The new rate for Canadian goods took effect Aug. 1, while revised duties on other countries took effect Thursday.)

Trump increased levies on Canadian imports after failing to reach an updated trade agreement with the country’s leaders by the start of August. The president has tied the tariffs, in part, to what he maintains is Canada’s failure to reduce the cross-border flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. — though Canadian leaders have disputed that claim. 
It’s not clear when a deal between the two countries might be reached.
The latest tariffs have a critical exception, though: the 35% duties don’t apply to goods covered by an existing deal called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump signed in 2018, during his first term. That agreement allows many products to be traded duty-free if they largely originate from within North America.
Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said between 85% and 90% of Canadian exports likely fall under that agreement. Meanwhile, he said, all of the energy that Vermont imports from Canada appears to also be covered by the agreement.
The latter is particularly important since Vermont gets about a quarter of its electricity from Hydro-Quebec, based in the province of the same name, while about a third of the fuel used to heat homes and businesses in the state comes from Canadian dealers.
The tariff situation is further complicated by the fact some products have been facing separate levies for months, Pieciak said. Imports of Canadian steel and aluminum have faced 50% tariffs since June, he said, and aren’t exempted under the 2018 deal.
Meanwhile, 25% tariffs on foreign imports of automobiles and auto parts have been in effect since earlier this year, though there are certain exemptions to those levies. 
Pieciak said the tariffs on metals have already affected some businesses in Vermont this summer. He recalled conversations with housing and business developers who are concerned that future projects could be plagued by higher material costs. 
“A lot of the projects that are up and running had to source their steel well before they started construction. And they largely have missed the recent imposition of the tariffs,” he said. “But I do worry about what it means for projects that are on the drawing board — projects that will come to fruition in the months and years ahead.”
Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made cars have not yet been reflected in the prices consumers see at dealerships around Vermont, said Matt Cota, who represents auto dealers in the state. That’s because there is often a long gap between when a new car leaves a factory and when someone buys it at a dealership, he said.
But “unless things change,” Cota said, higher vehicle prices are on the horizon.
Pieciak also noted Vermonters can still expect new expenses in the coming months, across the board, due to Trump’s tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab estimated this week that some of the sharpest immediate impacts will be to apparel costs — with near-term price increases expected at 39% for shoes and 37% for clothing. 
Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, said at a press conference Thursday that the new slate of tariffs would only further strain the U.S.-Canada relationship. He predicted further detrimental effects on tourism in Vermont as a result.
“I think it’s going to be a while before they start trusting us again,” Scott said.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard. This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter. According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023.

Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting. The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”

Dias Goncalves was arrested by federal immigration authorities shortly thereafter. (Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff's Officer YouTube)Mesa County is suing top Colorado officials over a state law that limits the type of information local law enforcement can share with federal immigration authorities, continuing fallout from a June traffic stop in the county that led to a Utah college student’s 15-day detention.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Denver, alleges that the Colorado law, known as Article 74, is vague to the point of being unconstitutional and interferes with the federal government’s constitutional discretion over immigration.
“The vagueness and lack of clarity surrounding the operation and scope of Article 74, coupled with the severe penalties and hardships for noncompliance, has caused confusion among law enforcement agencies, systemically chilled Plaintiffs’ interactions with federal law enforcement, and caused the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office to pull back from cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies,” the lawsuit says.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Article 74, created through bills passed in 2021 and this year, prohibits local law enforcement and government officials from sharing certain information with federal agents for the purpose of immigration enforcement. There are exceptions for active criminal investigations.
Earlier this summer, Mesa County Sheriff’s Deputy Alexander Zwinck pulled over a 19-year old college student from Utah, Caroline Dias Goncalves, for trailing a semitrailer too closely. Zwinck let Goncalves go with a warning, but told immigration officials about her presence in the county through a Signal group chat meant for drug enforcement operations. Goncalves, who is from Brazil and has applied for asylum, was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for nearly two weeks.
Afterwards, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell placed Zwinck on a three-week unpaid leave and Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against the deputy.
Rowell is a plaintiff in the county’s lawsuit against the state.










We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs.


– Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr


“The statute’s lack of clarity creates a significant risk, as we’ve already seen, of arbitrary enforcement, which could lead to substantial fines and legal challenges against our employees,” Mesa County Attorney Todd Starr said during a county commissioner meeting on Tuesday. “This action sends a clear message: We will not stand by while our employees are targeted for doing their jobs. This step is not just lawful, it’s necessary. It protects those who protect our community and ensures they can continue to work without fear of politically motivated litigation.”
The lawsuit alleges that Article 74 has compromised criminal investigations in Mesa County related to drug smuggling, child exploitation and sex crimes because it limits collaboration with local and federal law enforcement.
The county wants a federal judge to clarify that law enforcement and government employees violate Article 74 only if they disclose personal information for the “sole” purpose of helping with immigration enforcement, and that local law enforcement can inquire about someone’s immigration status for “reasonable and legitimate law enforcement purposes.”
Weiser and Gov. Jared Polis are named as defendants.
In a statement, Weiser spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco wrote that Colorado’s law is clear that state law enforcement does not do federal civil immigration enforcement.
“It’s unfortunate that Mesa County filed this lawsuit. The Department of Law has a responsibility to follow facts and defend and enforce state law. We’ll continue to take this duty seriously,” he wrote.

Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton confirmed the news that 45-year old Michael Brown was apprehended to several news agencies on Friday afternoon.
Shortly after, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced the news in a social media post.
“The Anaconda shooter Michael Brown has been apprehended,” the governor posted on X. “Incredible response from law enforcement officers across Montana. Thank you to all partners for your commitment to the search. May God continue to be with the families of the four victims still grieving their loss.”

Our thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families.”
Local, state and federal law enforcement agencies had been looking for Brown for a week.
At around 10:30 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 1, Brown walked into the Owl Bar at 819 E. 3rd St. in Anaconda and began firing.
According to the Montana Standard, the suspect was a U.S. military veteran, serving in the Army from 2001 to 2005. He was then in the National Guard from 2006 to 2009, reaching sergeant in the force, the newspaper reported.

Free.,Trump EPA claws back $7B in solar funding already promised to states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-epa-claws-back-7b-solar-funding-already-promised-states,,"Several congressional Democrats on Friday slammed the Trump administration’s announcement it will cancel nearly $7 billion in grants to fund solar energy projects for low-income households, saying the move was illegal and would raise families’ energy prices if allowed to proceed.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”The move sparked a backlash from Democrats in Congress and the states, who said that rescinding the already-obligated funding violated the law.“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program,” the five Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation wrote in a Friday letter to Zeldin and White House Budget Director Russell Vought.“Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution.”Letters to 60 states, organizationsThe 60 recipients of the grant awards, mostly state governments but also tribes and some multistate projects, received letters from the EPA on Thursday informing them the grants were being cancelled.The letter sent to Oregon’s Department of Energy said the reconciliation bill Trump signed on July 4 rescinded the authorization and appropriations for the fund.“Any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,” the letter said.“The EPA has been weighing options for the future of the Solar for All program and has made the decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants because the EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering and overseeing the nearly $7 billion outlay to approximately 60 grant recipients.”The letter said the EPA realized that recipients “may have begun to rely” on the program for preliminary budgeting and staffing decisions. But it said that “due to the early nature of such expenditures, we expect any harms to interests suffered to be remedied and remediable.”In a statement Friday, the Oregon Department of Energy said it had already spent “significant administrative funds” to launch the program later this year, and hinted a legal challenge may come soon.“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read. “We are surprised and disappointed to hear the U.S. EPA is moving to rescind these already-obligated funds. ODOE will work with our partners, the Governor’s Office, and Oregon’s Attorney General to consider next steps to ensure these funds continue to serve Oregonians as intended.”‘A betrayal’Like the Oregon Democrats, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, the ranking member on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the move was illegal and predicted it would raise energy prices.“The Trump Administration is stealing from working families in broad daylight,” Pallone said in an early Friday statement. “This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills. Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal – it’s a betrayal by this Administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”Other Democrats, including Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, also focused on the economic impact.“President Trump ran on lowering costs and creating jobs,” Hobbs wrote on X. “Gutting Solar for All will do the exact opposite. It makes our air dirtier, our energy bills higher, and our economy weaker.

The firefighters, 14 of whom still work for the city, allege that over a period of several years, the city misclassified them as exempt from the federal Fair Labor Standards Act’s provisions on overtime pay due to their status as lieutenants or captains.

The FLSA provides that some employees with managerial duties are exempt from overtime pay due to their role as salaried personnel — but also says first responders generally do not meet the requirements for that particular exemption.

According to the lawsuit, the city “was put on notice” of the misclassification sometime prior to September 2023 — after which it implemented a 14-day work period for some firefighters. The firefighters allegedly worked more than 106 hours during those 14-day work periods and, according to the lawsuit, the city failed to compensate them for those additional hours at the legally required rate of overtime pay.

The lawsuit does not specify the total number of uncompensated hours, or the total dollar cost associated with the work.
The plaintiffs include West Des Moines residents Neil Weglarz, Joshua Schut, Jacob Shapansky, Paul O’Connell and Robert Monson; Ryan Gordon and Derrik Bingham of Grimes; Timothy Hostetter, Kristopher Ruszkowski and Vince De Boer of Urbandale; Corry Dolbeer of Ankeny; John Carlson of Indianola; James Kirkman of Clive; Jeremy Nelson of Jefferson Township, and Michael Staiert of Norwalk.
All of the plaintiffs are currently employed by the fire department except for Bingham, who was employed by the city from January 2006 through March 2024.
Each of the plaintiffs are seeking compensation for unpaid overtime, plus interest and attorneys’ fees.
The City of West Des Moines has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was initially filed in Polk County District Court before being transferred to federal court. City Attorney Greta Truman did not return a call seeking comment Friday.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/federal-cutbacks-could-cost-ct-food-stamp-program-180m/,The memorandum issued Friday did not project added costs tied to Medicaid that will pump nearly $7 billion in federal funds into CT this year.,"Connecticut could face close to $180 million in annual extra costs to its supplementary nutrition and food stamps program within the next five years, according to a very preliminary analysis of recent federal budget cuts by Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration.
But the memorandum Lamont’s budget office issued Friday did not project added costs tied to the biggest area that President Donald Trump and Congress targeted for cutbacks: the Medicaid program, which will pump nearly $7 billion in federal funds this year into Connecticut nursing homes, hospitals, health clinics, social service programs and into health coverage for low-income adults and children.
Some policy changes in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” enacted in July to finance huge federal tax cuts, took effect immediately. But many don’t kick in until after the November 2026 elections, and others have no financial impact on Connecticut until 2028 or later.
The Connecticut legislature directed the Lamont administration to provide lawmakers with an update in early August, once all federal budget levels had been set.
Lamont’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, noted that despite the bill’s passage in July, it doesn’t represent final congressional action, and federal officials won’t fix many spending levels until this fall or later.
“We anticipate additional federal actions will be adopted in the coming months for which the state will also need to consider what response, if any, is appropriate,” Beckham wrote in his memo to the General Assembly. “Finally, we note that many provisions in the act have future effective dates, and even those that were effective on passage require additional clarity and guidance from the federal government before we have a full understanding of all of the impacts, both primary and secondary.”
In other words, Connecticut officials likely will be making program adjustments and spending decisions related to this for years to come.
The General Assembly is expected to meet in special session in late September or early October, and leaders have left open the possibility of making some adjustments to state spending to response to the federal cutbacks.
Leaders of the legislature’s Democratic majority have said for months they expect that Connecticut may want to invest hundreds of millions more of its own dollars annually — starting in the near future — to blunt the pain of federal cutbacks.
And while most of that pain is expected to come in the Medicaid program, Beckham wrote that there are issues already identified in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a joint effort by federal and state governments to provide food stamps and other aid to low-income adults and children.
Connecticut serves more than 391,000 residents yearly through this program, providing $894 million in benefits.
The Lamont administration estimates Connecticut could lose up to $130 million annually, by 2029 or 2030, because Congress has tightened rules for states with high “error rates.” This refers to how often they issue food stamp benefits to ineligible households, or how frequently they issue the incorrect amount.
Washington also has indicated it will cover a small share of the SNAP program administrative costs, which should add $43 million per year to Connecticut’s expenses by 2027.
Congress and Trump also are ending a national obesity prevent grant offered through the SNAP program. That’s another $4.6 million Connecticut must do without.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CT-state-capitol-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-08-08 17:56:39.250059

SNAP and Food Stamps provide nutrition benefits to supplement the budgets of disadvantaged families. (Getty Images)A group of West Virginia advocacy and food assistance organizations is calling on Gov. Patrick Morrisey not to comply with a request from the federal government for personal information belonging to recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps. 
The 22 organizations — which include the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the ACLU of West Virginia, Facing Hunger Foodbank and the West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition — called the request an “outrageous act of federal overreach” without clear parameters for how the federal government intends to use the personal data. 
“West Virginia SNAP recipients share their personal information with the state SNAP agency because they trust it will be used only to help them access food assistance,” the letter says. “That trust is grounded in longstanding state and federal laws and standards that strictly limit how this data can be used. Now, the USDA is attempting to bypass those protections — pressuring states to hand over sensitive data for unrelated and undisclosed purposes.”
Earlier this year, the federal Department of Agriculture asked states to turn over SNAP recipients’ sensitive information to comply with an executive from President Donald Trump called “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.”
The request included recipients’ names, dates of birth, personal addresses and Social Security numbers along with records to calculate the amount of SNAP benefits they got over time. 
“President Trump is rightfully requiring the federal government to have access to all programs it funds, and SNAP is no exception,”  USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement at the time. “For years, this program has been on autopilot, with no USDA insight into real-time data. The Department is focused on appropriate and lawful participation in SNAP, and today’s request is one of many steps to ensure SNAP is preserved for only those eligible.”
The federal agency later broadened the request to other data points including recipients’ immigration status and household members. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service said it would use the data to “ensure program integrity,” including verifying recipients’ eligibility and would follow up with states as necessary regarding next steps. 
Late last month, a coalition of 21 states and Washington D.C. led by Democrat attorneys general in California and New York sued the federal government over privacy concerns with the data request. They asked a judge to stop the government from making the demand or stop it from withholding funding from states that don’t comply. 
In their letter, the West Virginia organizations write that complying with the request would compromise SNAP recipients’ personal data and cause fewer people to feel comfortable participating, undermining Morrisey’s efforts to improve health in the state through his “Four Pillars of a Healthy West Virginia” plan.
In West Virginia last year, SNAP provided food assistance to 277,400, or one in six people, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It fed more than 41 million Americans that year. 
A spokesman for Morrisey did not respond by deadline to a request for comment.

The South Burlington School District is expected to hire an investigator to look into a complaint about a mysterious notebook pillorying the former superintendent that was reportedly circulated at some teachers’ social gatherings.
The investigation comes after a July 23 formal complaint filed with the school board by Kristin Romick, the district’s executive director of educational support services who just this week assumed the temporary role of acting superintendent. The district’s former superintendent, Violet Nichols, resigned the position effective Aug. 1.
According to the complaint, Romick was made aware by some district employees about an after-graduation celebration held at the Saint John’s Club, a bar in Burlington, on June 13, where an elusive book, dubbed by the complainant as the “black book,” was being circulated among staff. The book, Romick alleges, was handmade and included questions written down for teachers and staff to answer.
The party was advertised in an email to all high school staff, and according to an email, began at noon on the day of graduation.
The employees who reported the incident to Romick stated that they were asked to answer the question for that day and sign their name. One of the questions, according to the complaint, read, “What is the next lie the superintendent will tell us?”
The employees told Romick the book is mostly circulated during social gatherings after teachers’ paydays on Fridays and is usually kept in teachers’ cars. According to the complaint, it contains ongoing commentary relating to district leadership, often in a negative tone.
Romick alleged that, according to reports from staffers, the book was being circulated at this post-graduation party by Beth Adreon, co-president of the teachers’ union.
Romick, apart from allegations of the book, also claims that separate conversations held at the party suggested a “premeditated” and “coordinated” effort to remove district leaders, including Nichols.
While a public records request sent by The Other Paper to the district to see the book was denied by Adreon, it has been described by some district staff as a sort of “burn book,” a term used to refer to a collection of negative comments or opinions about a certain group or person. The term gained popularity in 2004 after the movie “Mean Girls” used the term.
Adreon, in an emailed reply to the public records request, said the union is a private institution and is not subject to public records requests.
“Further, the South Burlington Education Association is not in possession of a ‘black book,’” she wrote.
In a phone call, the other South Burlington Educators’ Association Co-President, Noah Everitt, also asserted that he was not aware of any “Mean Girls-style burn book existing at any level, SBEA-wise or non-SBEA-wise.”
He did say, however, that he was aware that a book does exist, primarily as a way for teachers to annotate their thoughts.
“It’s not a burn book, and it also has absolutely nothing to do with the SBEA,” he said, adding that the book is mostly associated with teachers’ social gatherings every “Payday Friday.”
Meanwhile, the Vermont NEA has filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Vermont Labor Relations Board, alleging Romick’s investigation is intended to “harass, threaten and intimidate the union president for the work that she did on behalf of her 400 union members.”
The filing calls on the Vermont Labor Relations Board to rule that the investigation is unlawful and find that Romick has “interfered with, restrained, and coerced” the union’s leadership team and members.
But Romick, in her complaint, says these reports from employees have only amplified her growing concern about “fear for my own position and well-being” from retaliation by the South Burlington Educators Association.
“I believe my fears are justified,” Romick wrote. “It is now evident that there may be a coordinated and targeted plan, orchestrated in part by members of the SBEA and co-president Beth Adreon, to undermine and remove certain employees, including myself, due to internal political alignment or professional associations.”
That professional association, Romick said, is her open support of Nichols.
Nichols’ resignation came amid simmering tension between the South Burlington Educators’ Association and Central Office leadership. The turmoil bubbled over in April when some union members began publicly voicing their grievances about Nichols, citing toxic working conditions, fear of retaliation and questionable decision-making. The call for a new superintendent came after the union engaged in a “listening tour,” which surveyed nearly 300 of its members.
Romick, among other district staffers, has stood firm in her support of the former superintendent, even sending another email to the board in June that outlined a growing concern that she may be targeted next.
In a statement to The Other Paper, Everitt and Adreon said the complaint can only be described “as retaliation for protected union work,” asserting that they expect a speedy conclusion to this “distraction.”
“As a union, we will vigorously defend our right to organize,” the co-presidents wrote. “To that end, we will actively support our members and protect them from this type of retaliation intended to punish and intimidate those who advocate for our students, schools, and profession.”

Romick’s complaint asks the board to launch a formal investigation into the use and distribution of the book during school-affiliated social gatherings and the possible orchestration of leadership changes.
School board Chair Seamus Abshere said that while he is unable to comment on the investigation as it remains open, he did confirm that the board is tapping a third party to investigate the complaint.
“If the facts turn out to be as represented in the complaint, it would be a matter of significant concern,” he said. “However, I believe we should not draw conclusions until the facts are understood through a prompt and thorough investigation.”

Gretchen Whitmer took executive action on Friday to help Michiganders maintain affordable access to health insurance following congressional Republican’s moves to make it harder for people to get and keep their federal marketplace health plans.
Whitmer signed an executive directive for the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services to raise awareness and educate residents on their options to keep or get insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplace plans when enrollment opens in November.
“We wanted to make [this effort] formalized because it’s crucial that we maximize our ACA enrollment,” Whitmer said. “It’s crucial that people across Michigan know that they have the tools and the ability to get answers to their questions.”
Whitmer added that she can’t unilaterally shield Michigan from all the impacts of the Republican “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” now that President Donald Trump has signed the bill into law, nor can she reverse the impact of the majority Republican Michigan congressional delegation’s votes to push it through.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“What I can do is whatever it takes to help make life a little easier for Michiganders, and the work we can do in state government to ensure that people have a little help in these challenges,” Whitmer said. “No Michigander should have to choose between paying their bills and getting to the doctor or buying groceries.”
The federal program’s enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year, which were key aspects of former President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act and extended via the Inflation Reduction Act. The subsidies worked to lower health insurance premiums in the wake of the COVID pandemic.
Trump’s signature budget bill includes potentially significant changes to the Affordable Care Act and steep cuts to Medicaid, which Democrats have warned would affect scores of Americans and Michigan residents, especially in rural areas represented by Republicans.
As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, the Republican budget bill did not extend enhanced premium tax credits for marketplace plans, according to the Center for American Progress, an independent nonpartisan policy institute. That could mean 20 million federal marketplace insurance enrollees could see their premium costs spike when open enrollment opens in November.

Whitmer’s office on Friday elaborated on the impact of those credits ending, noting that residents on marketplace plans would see the cost of health care rise by $700 per person, or roughly $2,400 for a family of four people.
Michigan families will also have a shorter window to enroll due to changes made in the budget bill.
Whitmer’s executive order signed Friday would direct the Department of Insurance and Financial Services to increase awareness on the changes spearheaded by Trump and Republicans in Washington, D.C.
“[Trump’s budget bill] threatens to really devastate health care writ large, but especially in rural areas,” Whitmer said. “This is why it matters not just to one community or another, whether or not you get your health care through Medicaid or through your workplace or another method. Everyone pays a price if these systems are not supported and maintained. When you need care, you need it close and you need quality.”
DIFS Director Anita Fox said access to affordable quality care wasn’t just a cornerstone of good medical health, but also economic and financial security.
“We are proud that Michigan currently has the lowest uninsured rate in history, but new federal changes will raise out-of-pocket costs and make it more difficult to apply for and stay enrolled in health insurance, jeopardizing Michiganders’ health,” Fox said.
The governor added that she hoped the executive order would help people hold on to their health care or find another plan that works for them – and one they can afford – and without mounting debt from being uninsured or underinsured.
“This is one way we’re seeking to mitigate the harm that’s coming from the bill that passed in Congress recently,” Whitmer said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8084332-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

(Martina Nolte, Creative Commons CC-by-sa-3.0)Montana’s U.S. senators submitted a letter this week urging Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to “identify a path forward” to maintain sufficient water levels in Flathead Lake in future years facing drought conditions.
The Aug. 5 letter signed by Republican Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy asks the secretary to collaborate with local and regional stakeholder groups to find a solution that balances the myriad uses of the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.
“I request that you … identify a solution that maintains hydropower production and economic development, abides by statutory requirements and other legal obligations, including President Trump’s recent Executive Order 141554-Unleashing American Energy, respects property rights, promotes outdoor recreation, has the support of the local communities, and minimizes future conflict,” the letter states.
While above-normal precipitation in July has kept Flathead Lake closer to normal levels than was anticipated earlier this year, the senators wrote a holistic approach to lake levels should be considered in the long term, as opposed to requiring one-off fixes every time there are drought conditions and potential low-water years.
Montana’s elected federal and state officials have mounted political pressure on dam operators and federal officials to maintain water levels on Flathead Lake for several years, following drought conditions in 2023 that led to record-low lake levels more than two feet lower than the lake’s full-pool elevation of 2,893 feet by summer’s end.
The primary ask from the state has been for the federal government to approve water releases from Hungry Horse Reservoir upstream, while Energy Keepers Inc., the tribal corporation that operates Se̓liš Ksanka Qĺispe̓ (SKQ) Dam at the lake’s southern end, decrease outflows to the lower Flathead River.
As lake levels dropped in late June of 2023, economic concerns in the region grew as boat launches and docks were largely unusable, farmers in the region dealt with decreased abilities to irrigate crops, and power generation from the SKQ Dam, which controls the lake’s output, slowed.
In early 2025, Energy Keepers stated that streamflow conditions in the Flathead Basin were “similar to 2023 and 2024” and the dam was being operated to increase the likelihood of filling to full pool. To that end, dam operators requested, and received, approval from the federal government to make temporary modifications to outflows from the dam to maximize the chance of refilling under drought conditions, including reducing outflows in June and July.
However, by June, dam operators announced they did not expect the lake to reach its full pool, with forecasts showing the lake dropping more than a foot by July.

Low levels of snowpack and warm weather throughout the spring led to the Flathead River basin sitting around 59% of its average snow water equivalent — the amount of water is contained within the snowpack — which Energy Keepers said was not enough to fill the lake, despite plans to reduce outflows through mid-July.
But precipitation in the region in July was nearly 300% of normal, according to the latest Energy Keepers update last week, which altered the lake’s late-summer fate. Recent streamflow forecasts estimated “the lake will remain in the top 12 inches through most of August,” according to Energy Keepers, a full half-foot higher than originally anticipated.
Despite the better-than-expected conditions, the letter submitted to Secretary Burgum, which praised his agency’s actions granting the temporary modifications to SKQ operations, focused on an expected future of droughts in the region.
“Over the last several years, we have seen unseasonably warm conditions that have resulted in accelerated runoff in the northern reaches of the Flathead basin. Decreased inflows into the lake have precipitated lower lake levels, adversely affecting environmental and economic conditions for residents and visitors alike,” the letter states. “I urge you to identify a path forward that does not depend on granting annual emergency authorities to maintain sufficient lake levels for the local communities that call Flathead Lake home.”
During the 2023 drought, which ultimately saw Flathead Lake’s surface level at 31 inches below full pool by the end of August, tensions around who gets a say in the lake’s management ratcheted up.
Some groups in the region, led by members of the Flathead County Republicans and local property owners, blamed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, who operate SKQ Dam through the tribally-owned corporation Energy Keepers Inc. Those groups challenged the scientific consensus that the low lake levels were due to historic warm and dry conditions that saw a rapid melt off of the area’s snowpack.
Complaints filed against Energy Keepers with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission led to FERC issuing an analysis that found the dam operators did not violate their operating license by allowing the lake level to drop.
Under the FERC license, Energy Keepers is able to regulate the top 10 feet of the dam-controlled lake, amounting to 1.2 million acre-feet of water storage.
Under normal operating procedures, the dam-controlled lake drops to its lowest point by April 15 to provide flood control across the region, then rises to 3 feet from full pool by Memorial Day, hitting a full pool elevation of roughly 2,893 feet by June 12. The goal is to then operate in the full-pool range through Labor Day, according to Energy Keepers CEO Brian Lipscomb, before lowering the levels in October to mitigate erosion from fall storms. However, there is no legal obligation to maintain a full pool in the license.
SKQ Dam is part of the greater Columbia River Basin network of hydroelectric dam projects that regulate waterways for hydropower generation, flood control, navigation, fish and wildlife preservation, irrigation and recreation. A key part of the operating considerations for the region’s dams are to protect and preserve threatened and endangered fish species including salmon and bull trout, the latter which are found throughout the Flathead River basin.
However many businesses in the region rely heavily on Flathead Lake’s recreational opportunities, with studies from the University of Montana shoring that roughly $600 million is spent in Flathead County from anglers, boater and other tourists visiting the lake.
Montana politicians at the county, state, and federal level have voiced that concern, including in a resolution brought to the 2025 Legislature by Senate President Matt Regier, a Flathead Republican, which sought increased prioritization of recreation in management decisions.
Changes to outflows from any one project can have a ripple effect downstream. The Columbia River Basin Technical Management Team (TMT), comprising of representatives from four states, the Bureau of Reclamation (BoR), Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bonneville Power Administration and six tribal nations, manages the regions federally-operated dams as a whole system.
During the 2023 drought, in subsequent legislation introduced in Congress by Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, and in a 2025 letter from Zinke to Burgum, requests were made to authorize the release of water from Hungry Horse Dam into Flathead Lake. However, due to the size discrepancy between the two reservoirs, it would take roughly 15 feet of water from Hungry Horse to add eight inches to Flathead Lake.
“I humbly ask you to authorize the release (of) more water from the Hungry Horse Reservoir … to ensure viable lake levels for recreation on Flathead Lake this summer,” Zinke wrote. “I understand the lake will not get to full pool using these measures, however if we can prevent it from dropping to catastrophic levels, it will save small businesses and local tax revenue that is sorely needed.”
Studies published by the U.S. Geological Survey have indicated that releasing vast amounts of water from Hungry Horse dam would be detrimental to endangered bull trout in the Flathead River by decreasing habitat space and impacting the life cycle of aquatic insects, a primary food source for native fish.
“A big release would lead to cascading impacts to the entire aquatic ecosystem,” Clint Muhlfeld, the researcher who authored several studies, told the Flathead Beacon in 2023.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SQK_Dam_DSC_3657-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

It wasn’t a repeat of 2023, when an unmanned Chinese balloon flew across much of the United States. This week’s balloon was part of an U.S. military exercise taking place in Alaska.
The exercise is being organized by U.S. Northern Command, which covers North America, and NORAD — the North American Aerospace Defense Command, a unified Canadian-American group.
Maj. Jhanelle Haag, director of public affairs for the Alaskan Command and the Alaskan NORAD region, said the balloon was part of Arctic Edge 2025, taking place this month at sites across the state.
The exercise, pointed toward Russia, includes activities in Nome, Kotzebue, Cold Bay and other sites near the U.S.-Russian maritime border.
Some of the training includes practice in how to track and intercept incoming cruise missiles, according to information published by U.S. Northern Command, which covers North America.

This week’s balloon launch was from a South Dakota firm called Aerostar.
Russ Van Der Werff, vice president of stratospheric solutions for Aerostar, said in an interview his firm has been in the Alaska area several times, both for commercial flights and testing, “but you know, it never fails — we’re down here in South Dakota, and we fly lots of these every year, and we still get, about every two years, a news story from the local folks going, what is this? It catches the attention.”
Van Der Werff said Aerostar makes a variety of products, including high altitude balloons like the one tested this week in Alaska.
The company’s balloons are designed for missions that require eyes in the sky, but ones that can fly longer and higher than drones or manned aircraft.
Launching a satellite can be expensive and take time, he said, but a balloon can be brought into place quickly.
Balloons move at the orders of the wind, but Aerostar’s balloons are designed to change altitude, using outside air as ballast, which can change its altitude and stability. If the wind isn’t blowing the right way at a certain altitude, the balloon can rise or fall to a place where the wind is blowing the correct direction.
This spring, Aerostar tested a balloon that flew for 336 consecutive days over South Dakota, the longest flight ever by a controlled vehicle.
“We build a variety of different products, but within the high-altitude balloon space, we do equipment for commercial use, whether that’s disaster response, communication, environmental monitoring, scientific work, a lot of stuff with NASA, and then also the defense-related work, like we’re talking about here,” he said.
Neither Van Der Werff or military officials were willing to discuss details about what this week’s balloon was carrying, but typically, the company’s balloons are used for communication and “remote sensing,” putting cameras or other sensors above a particular target.
“It’s not all defense and those kinds of things,” he said, explaining that some balloons have been used to provide long-term aerial coverage of wildfires, and that the same balloon can track the spread of flames and provide a cellphone signal in remote areas.
“That’s a good example of how … a communications and sensing platform regionally positioned and persistently stationed in one location over multiple months can really connect, protect and save lives,” he said.

The order and opinion was issued by U.S. District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin in response to a lawsuit filed by the West Virginia Rivers Coalition last year over continued and excessive pollution from Chemours’ Washington Works plant.
“This case is simple and all too familiar. For years, Defendant Chemours Company has discharged pollutants into the Ohio River. The level of discharge far exceeds the legal limits that bind Chemours,” Goodwin wrote in his opinion and order. “Those pollutants endanger the environment, aquatic life and human health. Today, that unlawful, unpermitted discharge stops.”
A representative for Chemours told Mountain State Spotlight reporter Sarah Elbeshbishi that the company was “disappointed” in the ruling and “strongly disagree[d]” with the court’s characterizations. Chemours plans to appeal the decision.
The Ohio River supplies drinking water to 5 million people across several states, though not all of them are downstream from the Chemours facility.
The Rivers Coalition filed its initial suit in December 2024. A preliminary injunction hearing for the case was held in May. Goodwin said on Thursday Chemours continues to “boldly violate” discharge limits set in its state-issued permit and, in that hearing, “admitted as much.”
In a statement Thursday, members of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition celebrated the court’s order.
“This is a victory for public health and the Ohio River,” said Autumn Crowe, deputy director of West Virginia Rivers. “The court recognized what communities have known for years: Chemours has been polluting our water and ignoring its legal obligations.”
Representatives for Chemours previously told the court that it would take more than two years for the company to come into compliance with discharge limits. Attorney Dave Yaussy said in May that the court shouldn’t issue a preliminary injunction to stop the facility from operating because even that “won’t stop necessarily exceedances from occurring.”
In Thursday’s order, Goodwin didn’t much care for this argument. He said the company should “take any measures necessary to achieve and maintain compliance.”
“[Chemours] could shut down its plant, modify its manufacturing processes, reduce production or send process wastewater off-site to achieve compliance,” Goodwin wrote. “Compliance may be expensive and burdensome, but it is possible.”
Goodwin said the preliminary injunction to order Chemours to stop exceeding discharge limits is in the public interest due to the environmental and health harms known to be associated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.
PFAS, called “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down in bodies or the environment, are known carcinogens, and exposure to them has been linked to reproductive health issues, fetal development complications, thyroid diseases, various cancers and more. They also can endanger aquatic life and alter ecosystems where they are present.
States and the federal Environmental Protection Agency set certain standards for how much of specific pollutants companies are allowed to discharge into waterways. Those standards are based on research showing what exceedances could pose a threat to human and environmental health and are often enforced through the federal Clean Water Act as well as in permits issued to companies by states for operation.
According to documents provided to the court, Chemours’ Washington Works plant has been accused of at least 199 violations of its state permit, and therefore the Clean Water Act, for discharge exceedances.
“[Chemours’] permit is not a suggestion; rather, its permit protects public health and environmental life while balancing the needs of manufacturing,” Goodwin wrote. “But I cannot weigh the scales of that balance to inflict further harm on the communities that rely on clean water for life and livelihood. The Clean Water Act protects the public, and I will enforce it.”
Attorneys for Chemours previously argued to the court that the harms of these exceedances are too difficult to quantify and, therefore, impossible to prove to a degree appropriate for court action or to render relief for.
Goodwin said the harm of PFAS exposure is clear. To argue that relief can’t be sought due to difficulty in quantifying the actual harm, he wrote, is “dangerous.”
“[Chemours’] argument posits a dangerous premise: exposure to a harmful pollutant like [PFAS] is acceptable on some average, despite many permit violations, and the purpose of the Clean Water Act. Under this theory, a plaintiff exposed to concentrations of [PFAS] has no recourse until she develops a serious illness. This theory of irreparable harm cannot be,” Goodwin wrote. “Instead … all those who use the Ohio River suffer irreparable harm with each incremental exposure to [PFAS]. Incremental exposure, resulting in incremental harm, is irreparable harm. It need not be calculable.”
The order issued Thursday is not the end of this case; a trial is set for Sept. 16. Jennie Smith, the executive director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, said the organization is “looking ahead” to the trial in hopes it will “resolve remaining issues, namely civil penalties, and to a full and fair process that reflects the public’s interest in clean, safe water.”

Roger Marshall takes flight for appeal on improving air ambulance reimbursement,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/08/08/u-s-sen-roger-marshall-takes-flight-for-appeal-on-improving-air-ambulance-reimbursement/,Air ambulance personnel meet with Sen. Roger Marshall to make a case for improving Medicare reimbursement system to guarantee access to rural Kansans.,"U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, takes part in a briefing by an air ambulance crew before a flight from Newman Regional Health in Emporia. He was told Medicare reimbursement rates should be increased to better support aviation resources used to care for rural Kansans. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)EMPORIA — U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall squeezed into the back seat of the helicopter, adjusted a headset so he could communicate with the pilot and nurse, and lifted off on a 10-minute flight to quickly expose him to sounds and sights of an emergency medical flight.
Marshall, a Republican senator by election and a physician by profession, was no novice to the value of air transportation when caring for people in life-or-death circumstances.
“I practiced medicine in Great Bend for 25 years. I delivered a baby every day and would use helicopter services once a month. Every minute counts,” Marshall said. “Obviously, if you’re in Wichita and you need transportation, it’s going to be quicker to go by ground. If you’re in Atwood, Kansas, you need the helicopter. That’s just life in rural America.”
Marshall was on the Newman Regional Health helipad Friday to learn more about financial obstacles faced by air medical carriers.
He was a guest of LifeSave Kansas, a subsidiary of the Air Methods company that operates from more than 300 bases in 48 states. LifeSave has the helicopter based in Emporia and fixed-wing aircraft stationed in Liberal and Wichita. The company’s goal has been to sustain a network of aviation resources to transport patients at more than 100 mph from place to place, especially Kansans who live the greatest distance from major hospitals.
Carolyn Mayle, a vice president at Air Methods, said 40% of the company’s flights involved Medicare patients and 25% of flights were for Medicaid patients. She said state and federal government programs didn’t pay the full cost of emergency flight services.
Congress has an opportunity to work toward a more equitable compensation system for air carriers, she said.
“Medicare is used as a benchmark,” Mayle said. “Which is fine if Medicare pays their costs. For most providers, they pay 80% to 90% of costs. For air ambulance, it’s about 50%. Our reimbursement has not been updated by the government in over 20 years.”
She touted a bill cosponsored by U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kansas, that would update Medicare reimbursement rates for emergency air services by requiring compensation to be linked to data on actual costs. The bill has been reintroduced in the House and Senate.
“The bipartisan bill … is a common sense way to ensure all Americans have emergency access to hospitals and specialized providers regardless of their location,” Estes said in a statement. “When seconds matter, air ambulances have proven to be the best way to care for patients in need, and under this legislation, the work of the pilots and medical professionals on board will continue to save lives.”
Brittany Cox, area manager of the LifeSave, said the legislation would be an important step in solidifying emergency air transport operations.
“Being part of the emergency medical system gives me an up-close look at the challenges facing rural Americans when it comes to accessing critical trauma care,” said Cox, a nurse who had worked in western Kansas. “Timely access to emergency care can mean the difference between life and death.”
Marshall made no commitment on the pending legislation but said he was interested in creating savings in the Medicare Advantage program by deterring the practice of service providers reporting diagnosis codes to made patients appear sicker than they were.
He estimated the epidemic of upcoding Medicare patients cost the federal government a couple of hundred billion dollars each year.
“I would like to take some of that savings and then figure out an increase reimbursement for Medicare for this type of thing. There’s plenty of money being spent in Medicare, but it’s not always being spent the most efficient way,” the senator said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Marshall-air-ambulance-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

Federal judges Thursday ordered the state to retain a congressional map drawn by a special master in 2023 through the 2030 U.S. Census. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)A three-judge panel Thursday denied a request from plaintiffs in Alabama’s redistricting case to put the state back under “preclearance,” which would subject any future congressional maps to approval by the court.
In a separate order, the three-judge panel — U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, and U.S. District Judges Anna M. Manasco and Terry F. Moorer, both appointees of President Donald Trump — barred Alabama from using a map the Legislature passed in 2023 to conduct elections.
The judges also ordered the state to administer future congressional elections under the current congressional map, drawn by a special master in 2023, until the state enacts new congressional maps based on the 2030 U.S. Census. The map resulted in the election of U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, in the 2nd Congressional District last November. That election marked the first time in history that Alabama elected two Black U.S. Representatives at the same time.
“We have no doubt that the remedial rulings we have entered fully redress the constitutional and statutory violations we have found. We do no more than enter a remedy designed to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct. Accordingly, we decline at this time and on these facts to bail Alabama back into federal preclearance,” the judges wrote.

The court ordered the state to draw a new congressional map in 2023 after nearly two years of litigation with two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The panel ruled that the Legislature-approved map did not give Black voters the ability to choose their preferred leaders, and ordered a majority-minority congressional district and a district with a near-majority of Black voters to be drawn. 
After a trial earlier this year, the court ruled in May that Alabama had intentionally discriminated against Black voters by approving a map in 2023 that initially only had one majority-Black district.
Plaintiffs’ attorney Deuel Ross with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund expressed both disappointment and gratitude regarding the decision.
“We, as in the parties, the plaintiffs and the defendants, all asked the court to move quickly and not wait on issuing an order,” Ross said in an interview Friday. “Just as I said, disappointed that the court did not impose preclearance, but grateful for the court’s ruling that will keep in place, a fair remedy through 2030.”
Ross said that the ruling provides a “specific remedy that is fair to all voters” and that he is “excited because this is a hard fought one.”
The Alabama Attorney General’s office stated it was pleased with the ruling.
“We are pleased that the Court accepted our arguments and rejected the plaintiffs’ far-reaching request,” said William Califf, a spokesperson for the office in an email.
The state of Alabama has a brief due on September 4th, asking the Supreme Court to hear the case a third time, with the plaintiffs’ response due a month later. Ross also mentioned that the court’s decision provides clarity as the case is currently on appeal to the Supreme Court.

Olmscheid/Senate Media Services.Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, pledged to introduce legislation next year closing a “loophole” in Minnesota’s regulation of so-called ghost guns — untraceable firearms without serial numbers.
The declaration comes after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that state law doesn’t clearly restrict Minnesotans from possessing guns without serial numbers. The high court stated in its ruling that Minnesotans can possess a gun without a serial number as long as it complies with federal law.
The case originates from a 2022 car crash in Fridley. A state trooper responding to the crash found a Glock pistol without a serial number in the car, and the driver — Logan Vagle — was charged with felony possession of a self-assembled gun without a serial number.
The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday reversed an appeals court decision that upheld the felony charge and sent the case back down to the district court for further review. 
“Minnesota has not established an independent firearm serial number regime, and federal law does not require that Vagle’s pistol have a serial number,” Associate Justice Paul Thissen wrote in the majority opinion, joined by justices Anne McKeig, Gordon Moore and Sarah Hennesy.
Chief Justice Natalie Hudson wrote the dissent, which was joined by Associate Justice Karl Procaccini. 
In a statement, the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus praised the court’s ruling and said, in particular, it will impact lawful gun owners who manufacture firearms for personal use or own firearms manufactured before 1968 — the year the feds mandated gun manufacturers to include serial numbers on their firearms.
“Minnesotans who lawfully build personally manufactured firearms and possess pre-1968 firearms have always acted within the law. The court’s decision … confirmed that fact,” said Gun Owners Caucus Chair Bryan Strawser in a statement. 
“In the end, the final decision on whether and how to regulate ghost guns rests with the Legislature,” Thissen wrote in his opinion.
Latz, who serves as chair of the Senate’s Public Safety Committee, interpreted the Supreme Court opinion as a call to action. 
“No one could’ve foreseen a world where you could print the parts to make a gun at home, but that’s the world we live in today,” Latz said in a statement. “This decision makes it clear that our state gun laws need to reflect this new reality and the increasing prevalence of ghost guns.”
It’s unclear whether this Latz’s proposal will gain bipartisan support, which will be required to pass the Minnesota House and also the Senate, depending on the results of two special elections. The House is expected to return to a tie between Republicans and Democrats after a special election.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250303_AO_1482.jpg_1741201019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

Long’s sudden departure was first reported by the New York Times.Long wrote on social media that Trump will now appoint him to be U.S. ambassador to Iceland. The White House confirmed Long’s statement.“It is a honor to serve my friend  President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!” Long wrote.The former lawmaker’s ouster comes as the IRS must begin to implement changes to the tax code championed by Senate Republicans and signed into law by Trump just last month. Those include temporary tax relief for some tipped and overtime workers, as well as permanent changes to the child tax credit and several clean energy tax credits.The agency, which collects the lion’s share of the country’s revenue from individual taxpayers, lost more than 11,000 employees, or 11% of its workforce, either through deferred resignations or mass firings of probationary workers since Trump began his second term, according to a May 2 report from the agency’s inspector general.Confirmed in JuneLong, who represented Missouri in the U.S. House from 2011 to 2023 and then worked many years as a talk radio host, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a 53-44 vote on June 12.The former lawmaker and media personality faced scrutiny during his confirmation process from Senate Democrats who demanded an investigation into Long’s work with two companies, Capital Edge Strategies and White River, where he allegedly peddled fake tax credits.Senate Democrats also scrutinized donations Long received to his defunct Senate campaign after Trump announced in December he intended to install the former congressman at the helm of the IRS.Long denied any wrongdoing, and received the support of all Senate Republicans, including Senate Committee on Finance Chair Mike Crapo, of Idaho, who praised Long’s promise to “implement a top-down culture change at the agency.”‘One corruption bombshell after another’Sen.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Butler Hospital announced Thursday it will close its addiction treatment unit next week, leaving the Providence psychiatric facility at about half its full capacity of 197 beds.
The addiction unit comprises 29 beds and serves patients with substance use disorders who want detox treatment. The hospital noted in a news release that emergency departments statewide are able to care for these patients while the unit is closed. Two other units totalling about 70 beds were closed in July, making this the third unit Butler has closed since the strike began.  
The Providence psychiatric hospital has cited the ongoing SEIU 1199NE strike, now in its 12th week, as the impetus for the closures. The unionized workforce of nurses, mental health workers, and dietary, clerical and support staff — about 724 workers in all — have been on strike since May 15.
“Because of their unrelenting labor strike, we have had to close another 29 beds and shutter our addiction unit, reducing capacity for people struggling the most,” Mary Marran, the hospital’s president and COO said in a statement Thursday. “If SEIU’s political leaders truly cared about the vulnerable patients who rely on Butler Hospital, they would stop moving the goal posts and work in good faith to end this strike.”
Rhode Island Current reached out to SEIU 1199NE for comment but had not heard back by press time.
On Wednesday, the union and hospital negotiated formally, with a federal mediator present, for the first time in about six weeks. But in an email obtained by Rhode Island Current, Michael Wagner, the CEO of Butler’s owner Care New England, wrote that the talks were not much more productive this time around, despite a promising beginning. 
“Early in the session, the union restructured its health plan proposal to remain within our proposed financial framework,” Wagner wrote. “While the new structure was not our preferred approach, we acknowledged it was a step forward. Unfortunately, as the day and night progressed, the union introduced additional proposals — both economic and non-economic — that would significantly increase the cost of the contract.”

The negotiating session lasted 15 hours overall, and ended after 3 a.m. Wagner wrote that the union “shift[ed] the goal posts” and “introduced complexities,” including larger wage increases, that he argued the hospital and Care New England could not sustain. 
“There were several moments yesterday and into the night when an agreement could have been reached — moments when the union could have claimed real progress for their members,” Wagner wrote. “Instead, they pushed for more.” 
A video posted on Aug. 5 to the strikers’ new website counters the hospital’s leadership narrative, and claims that the union’s bargaining committee is made up entirely of frontline Butler workers and that it crafts counterproposals and contract priorities based on its membership’s input.
“No one tells us what to fight for,” Catherine Maynard, a registered nurse, says in the video.
“We decide together as a union,” adds John Cabral, an occupational therapy assistant, speaking after Maynard.
Union members have previously criticized Butler’s offer as inadequate, citing what it calls “poverty wages” of a little over $18 for housekeeping and food service staff as unsustainable given Rhode Island’s cost of living. That wage works out to about $37,500 a year, but the hospital claims that, with all benefits included, the total compensation for these workers is closer to $75,000.
A full breakdown of the hospital’s July 11 proposal, which it has repeatedly called its “last, best, and final” offer, remains available on Butler’s website.

Article Summary

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made her second visit to Illinois Friday to call on the state to end “sanctuary” immigration laws.
Barbara Hernandez filed a bill in Springfield to ban federal law enforcement from covering their faces while in the field.
Noem said federal agents have seen a massive increase in assaults against them, and supervisors decide what situations require officers to conceal their identity.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made her second visit of the year to Illinois on Friday to condemn the state’s immigration laws and defend the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.
At a news conference in west suburban Lombard, Noem highlighted four individuals arrested in Illinois and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement while arguing Illinois has given safe harbor to violent criminals. She also defended controversial tactics federal officers have used to arrest people.
“These individuals would still be out on our streets today, committing crimes and attacking people and harming them and hurting our children, if Gov. (JB) Pritzker and (Chicago) Mayor (Brandon) Johnson had their way,” Noem said of the four deported people pictured behind her while standing in front of a table filled with confiscated guns, drugs and cash.
Noem said people in Illinois – a state with 1.8 million foreign-born residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau – should focus on the needs of “American citizens” and “make them the priority, because they’re the ones who invested in this country.”
While Noem touted the thousands of people who have been deported since President Donald Trump took office in January, ICE’s methods for detaining people have generated controversy. Videos have gone viral on social media showing masked federal agents without uniforms surprising people as the agents jumped out of unmarked cars.
Noem defended agents using masks, claiming federal agents have seen a 1,000% increase in assaults against them in recent months. She also said agents do identify themselves with either something they are wearing or verbally.
“ICE is always wearing something that identifies them, who they are and what operation they’re out on,” Noem said. “I would say that they wear masks at times to protect their identities from dangerous situations. With the leadership teams, we leave that up to them to discern what’s necessary in certain situations.”

Some Illinois Democrats are seeking to ban federal agents from wearing masks in many cases. Rep. Barbara Hernandez, D-Aurora, filed House Bill 4086 in July that would prohibit law enforcement officers operating in Illinois from wearing masks while interacting with the public with exceptions for surgical masks for medical reasons and masks to protect police from smoke or gas.
It would also require officers to wear something identifying their name or badge number as well as the police agency they work for. The bill makes an exception for undercover officers.

“What the federal government’s doing is not in a line of duty where chemicals are going to be around or anything,” Hernandez said in an interview. “To my knowledge, it’s just people getting arrested at homes, at stores, at parking lots, so why should they hide who they are?”
She acknowledged Noem’s concerns about officers’ safety but argued that police officers have a public-facing job and should identify themselves when they’re working with the public.
“I want to be supportive of officers overall, however, these are officers that have been told to deport families, to spread fear, to do a lot of illegals actions – in a way they’re law enforcement and they’re not following certain laws either by not having a search warrant,” Hernandez said.
But Hernandez acknowledged the Illinois Attorney General’s Office has shared with her that her bill is likely unconstitutional as state laws cannot regulate the federal government.
“I know that this is something that my community wants to see and even though if (federal regulation) gets removed from the bill itself, we want to make sure people are aware of this; we want people to be sure that we are fighting for this,” Hernandez said.
Sanctuary policies 
Noem’s first visit earlier this year to Springfield was met with protests as she visited a Homeland Security detention facility and invoked the death of local activist Emma Shafer, despite objection from Shafer’s parents.

During her Springfield visit, Noem, alongside Republican state legislators, called on Pritzker to end the state’s “sanctuary” policies. She repeated her demands Friday.
“Kristi Noem is trying to make an example out of us because we refuse to join her in kissing the dirt under Trump’s shoes,” Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said during a news conference Friday. “And I’m sure it only infuriates her more that the law is simply on our side.”
State law does not protect people in Illinois from deportation. Federal officers under Noem’s leadership can still make arrests and deport people in Illinois. Under the 2017 TRUST Act signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, Illinois law enforcement is prohibited from arresting a person based solely on their immigration status and in most cases, cannot assist immigration officials with detaining people based on immigration status, according to the Illinois Attorney General’s office.
Noem said ICE has issued more than 1,600 detainers – a request to hold someone in local custody for ICE to pick up and process for deportation – in recent months, but only 8% have been fulfilled.
“Anybody who serves in law enforcement would say they’re used to partners,” Noem said. “They’re used to being able to call up a local law enforcement officer, a sheriff, a highway patrol officer, and say, ‘Hey, do you have any information on this individual that is a murderer that’s been cited in your city?’ That’s not happening in Illinois.”

Act 73 creates new provisions around school construction aid, giving some districts hope that the state could soon help fund school building renovations.

The Woodstock Union High School and Middle School building is in bad shape. Its HVAC, electrical and sewage systems — products of the mid-1960s — are now well past their useful life, according to school officials.
Sherry Sousa, superintendent of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union that operates the school, said the district “can’t guarantee, based on where our systems are now, that our sewage system is going to work.” 
For those familiar with Vermont’s public education system, this sort of story is hardly new. Districts throughout the state routinely deal with general disrepair and disruption caused by aging school buildings.

Over the years, education officials have pleaded with the state to restart a long-dormant state aid fund for school construction, which previously supported up to 30% of construction costs. But Act 73, the new education reform bill Gov. Phil Scott signed into law last month, is creating optimism among education officials that state aid could begin again.
Mountain Views Supervisory Union officials are banking on that. Last week, members of the school board and central administration announced they would press ahead with a new working committee to oversee plans for a new high school and middle school building under the terms of Act 73.
“We’ve decided that we can’t wait. We have to move forward. We need a new school,” Keri Bristow, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s board chair, said in an interview. “We have to do something before we have a catastrophic failure.”

‘Cart before the horse’
Vermont’s new education law seeks to address the state’s “languishing” school infrastructure through implementation of a new state aid for school construction fund. Act 73 provides preliminary rules around what schools could be eligible for state aid, and which projects should be prioritized.
The newly created State Aid for School Construction Advisory Board, set to first meet on or before Sept. 1, according to state Board of Education Chair Jennifer Samuelson, will work with the Agency of Education to further develop and finalize those parameters before the School Construction Aid Special Fund is officially created July 1 next year.
The advisory board is one of the first facets of the new law to get off the ground. The School Redistricting Task Force has already started work to consolidate Vermont’s 118 school districts, contained within 51 supervisory districts or supervisory unions, into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts. The school construction advisory board will work concurrently with that task force.

David Epstein with the Burlington architecture firm TruexCullins has worked with a number of Vermont’s school districts’ on facilities needs. He called the new framework in Act 73 a “positive sign.”
But he and others have cautioned that while the law sets up a framework for a revived school construction fund, the law does not directly address where funding will come from.
“Until a funding source is identified and the scale of that funding source is understood, it’s hard for me to be too optimistic,” Epstein said.
In a press conference Thursday, Scott said school construction is “going to be very important” once new school district maps are drawn and plans for consolidation are considered by the Legislature.
“That’s an appropriate time to talk about school construction,” he said. “We should be prepared for that, I realize that, but I think we’d be putting the cart before the horse in terms of school construction.”

To bond or not to bond
Vermont’s schools are the second oldest in the country and have continued to depreciate since state lawmakers paused construction aid nearly 20 years ago.
The Agency of Education has previously estimated schools will need upward of $6 billion in infrastructure investment over the next two decades.
“The level of investment has not been keeping up with the needs, and so there’s a tremendous amount of need,” Epstein said.
The disrepair in school facilities has forced districts to try and finance fixes through voter-approved bonds. Last year, the Colchester School District put forward a $115 million bond to modernize its aging schools — which, similar to the Woodstock High School, were built in the mid-20th century.
Colchester residents narrowly approved the bond proposal in November, but other districts that have floated bonds have not had such luck.
In March 2024, residents of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s seven member towns voted down a $99 million bond measure — throwing in flux plans to replace the Woodstock High School building.

And in 2021, voters in the member towns of the Harwood Unified Union School District sunk a $59.5 million construction bond. Without voter approval, the district is now stuck using general fund dollars to complete patch work repairs.
“We’re spending a lot of money on capital needs for things that really require wholesale renovation, new construction,” said Michael Leichliter, Harwood supervisory union’s superintendent.
Leichliter said the Harwood school district hired TruexCullins to conduct a review of its buildings, which he said should be completed by the end of August.
The Orleans Central Supervisory Union also hired TruexCullins to conduct a facilities assessment of school buildings. Dan Roock, the chair of the facilities committee there, said the district has $108 million in deferred maintenance across its eight school buildings.
Officials there are hoping to begin a community outreach campaign to gauge willingness for any new renovation projects.
Uncertainty over taxpayers’ appetite for million-dollar bond investments has created a tricky calculation for districts that fear catastrophic failure in their school buildings.
The more they wait, the more expensive repairs will cost, Roock said.
“We know we’ve got to do something,” he said. “We know it’s going to cost a lot of money — even if it’s no new construction, just fixing what we have.”

‘We’ve been patient’
For districts with construction plans in the works, like Orleans Central Supervisory Union, the decision whether to proceed with bond votes has been further complicated by the redistricting process underway.
“Some districts are waiting to see what the new districts are like,” Epstein said. “Some districts want to move forward with projects while they still can, while they still have control of their destiny, so to speak.”
Uncertainty around whether state lawmakers will even fund the new state aid construction fund only complicates that decision.

Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, chair of the Senate Education Committee, said there is “a general recognition that we have to figure out a way to help with school construction funding.”
“But there’s also a recognition that, right now with what’s happening nationally, we’re in uncharted waters, and we’re really going to have to see where we are come January and see what kinds of immediate crises we may be facing, or not,” he said.
In the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, officials say they can’t afford to wait any longer.
“I think we’ve been patient, and the board has been really responsible,” Sousa said. “Now, we really have to fill in the gray spaces of Act 73. We want to work with the Agency of Education to fill in that gray space and acknowledge, how does this school district move forward?”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) State utility regulators have filed a complaint with a federal agency, saying a regional electrical grid planning group’s system for assessing power line needs is misguided and will cost North Dakota ratepayers money. 
The North Dakota Public Service Commission on July 30 filed the complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The complaint is against the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages a regional electric grid that serves 15 states, including part of North Dakota, and parts of Manitoba, Canada. 
In December, MISO revealed a plan for 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion.
But the PSC says the group has changed the way it evaluates the costs and benefits of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.

During a meeting Thursday, Commissioner Jill Kringstad said the 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.
She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota. 
Commissioners estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades. 
Of the 22 projects, two reach into the eastern edge of North Dakota. The rest of the projects are in the northern tier of MISO states, from eastern South Dakota to western Ohio. 
Christmann said his objections aren’t over individual projects, but about how MISO changed its method to justify the projects. 
“There is nothing to justify the kind of costs imposed on our people,” Christmann said in an interview. 
North Dakota received support in its complaint from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana. 
The southern states are not being asked to help pay for the project in the northern MISO area but Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis objects to the cost-benefit analysis that was used. 
The cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.
MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South. 
“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The (proposed) portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”
While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Lewis said.
In a news release, the North Dakota PSC said its concerns were brought up to MISO during the stakeholder process but were not addressed.
MISO has 20 days from the date of the filing to file a response or request an extension with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


–  Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Tom Hartnett Jr. of Charleston. (Photo by Ed Wray/provided by The Citadel)With more than 1,100 miles to think while driving from Charleston to Galveston, Texas, three years ago, state Rep. Tom Hartnett Jr. found himself asking the same question again and again.
Why doesn’t South Carolina have its own maritime academy?
Hartnett was taking his son, Rhett, to the Texas A&M maritime academy — one of just seven such schools nationwide — for his freshman year.

Months later, the Charleston Republican won his first election to the Statehouse. Rhett, who plans to become a merchant mariner, will graduate later this year.
Since that trip, the elder Hartnett — a former stevedore turned real estate appraiser — has been taking steps to bring a new maritime academy to Charleston. Palmetto State residents interested in jobs on commercial vessels or along the waterfront shouldn’t have to face long distances — and expensive out-of-state tuition — to reach their goals, he said.
Earlier this week, Hartnett met with Brig. Gen. Sally Seldon, provost and dean of The Citadel, to discuss the potential creation of the South Carolina Maritime Academy at South Carolina’s military college.
“She was very receptive,” Hartnett told the SC Daily Gazette, adding he hopes a working group of education and maritime industry leaders will be formed in the coming months to discuss the next steps.
The academy would integrate with The Citadel’s existing infrastructure, reducing startup costs and accelerating the academy’s launch timeline. Hartnett said he hopes the academy will be up and running within two years.
A spokesperson for The Citadel did not respond to a request for comment, but the idea already has strong backing.
“The maritime industry faces significant challenges in meeting the growing demand for a skilled workforce,” Bradley Kerr, director of sales and marketing at Detyens Shipyards, said in a written statement.
“To ensure the future security and resilience of our nation’s maritime infrastructure, we must establish accessible and robust pathways for local and state students to pursue careers in critical fields such as marine engineering, naval architecture, marine mechanics and logistics, thereby fortifying our shipyards and logistical framework,” Kerr said.
John Cameron, executive director of the Charleston Harbor Pilots, said merchant marine officers who go on to leadership roles with shipping companies, insurers, admiralty law firms and port administration are more likely to be from a state with a maritime academy.
“South Carolina ought to be one of them,” Cameron said in a written statement.
Hartnett said the Port of Charleston and the area’s well-established maritime industry offer ready-made training opportunities.
“Our back yard is nothing but a classroom — a training area for mariners,” he said.
A spokesperson for the S.C. State Ports Authority, which owns and operates Charleston’s port, said in an email that the state agency is “thankful for Hartnett’s continued support of the maritime industry and expects to participate in conversations with him to support his efforts.”
A handful of private and public maritime training programs already exist in the Charleston region, including at Trident Technical College which offers an associate’s degree in marine engineering technology.
But existing programs aren’t on the scale of what an academy recognized by the U.S. Maritime Administration would offer. Such academies must provide all of the instruction and at-sea training needed to become a commissioned officer and U.S. Coast Guard-licensed Merchant Mariner. The proposed Citadel program would also offer four-year degrees in marine engineering, logistics and transportation.
The federal Maritime Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, provides training vessels and some funding, although the S.C. Legislature would likely need to kick in additional state money for a South Carolina academy.
It’s still too early to know how much that might take, Hartnett said.
“By leveraging Charleston’s port infrastructure and The Citadel’s military structure, the academy would provide immediate access to real-world maritime experience through partnerships with local shipyards, port operators, and federal Ready Reserve Force vessels” owned by the Maritime Administration, according to a release from Hartnett announcing his proposal.
The seven maritime academies nationwide graduate fewer than 1,500 licensed officers annually – far below the yearly estimated need for 2,200 licensed officers and 9,700 water transportation workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of current merchant marine officers are expected to retire over the coming 15 to 20 years.
The median pay — meaning half earn more and half less — for such workers is $66,490 per year, according to the bureau.
“How can we continue to deny our citizens the ability to open the doors to career paths like that?” Hartnett said. “We owe it to South Carolina. We owe it to our citizens, the students and our waterfront industry. It’s just something that has to be done.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)HOBBS, NM — His voice steady, Marcos Carranza, an immigrant and retired oil and gas worker, recounted that he saw coworkers die on the job during his 15 years in the industry.
“The most vulnerable workers need the most support since they are affected the most,” Carranza said in Spanish.

U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), who represents border communities in New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District, says he’s hoping to help provide that support.
After a day of triple-digit heat across much of the Southwestern corner of the state, Vasquez on Aug. 7 announced the reintroduction of legislation mandating oil and gas companies to pay for oil and gas workers’ health care costs.
“You are the ones sacrificing your bodies, your health,” Vasquez said to the crowd of about two dozen people, including oil workers and their families, gathered under the awning in Heizer Park for the announcement. Most wore yellow shirts emblazoned with the sunburst logo of immigrant rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido.
Earlier this year, Somos Un Pueblo Unido released a report with researchers from the University of New Mexico that documents conditions for workers in the oil-and-gas producing Permian Basin, including: work days exceeding 12 hours; dangerous driving conditions; hazardous workplaces; and a lack of access to health care or unemployment benefits during injuries or downturns.
New Mexico’s Permian counties — including Eddy and Lea counties — consistently rank poorly on national surveys of air quality and Southeastern counties have reported high rates of asthma hospitalizations, particularly in Chaves County.

Vasquez’s legislation, introduced on Tuesday, requires oil and gas companies making more than $50 million a year in revenues to pay into a trust fund to reimburse oil and gas workers for medical costs related to low air quality and prolonged heat exposure. Vasquez introduced a similar measure in 2023.
The fund, which requires contributions equal to the total paid to each company’s 10 top-compensated employees, would allow reimbursement for out-of-pocket medical costs to oil and gas workers,  their spouses and children for certain health conditions, including asthma; illnesses due to heat exposure; and cardiovascular diseases linked to methane exposure.
In the new version of the bill, Vasquez is also calling for a federal study of long-term health outcomes in oil and gas producing states: New Mexico, Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Louisiana and Alaska.
Vasquez noted that Latino and Hispanic workers, many of them immigrants, represent a significant portion of New Mexico’s oil and gas workforce. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics estimates Latino and Hispanic workers accounted for one-third of the national workforce in 2024.
“It’s really important to me that the Hispanic community in the Southeast part of New Mexico feels that they are represented, that they are taken care of, for their contributions in this country,” he said.
Vasquez said that people who are undocumented or hired by contractors or subcontractors are vulnerable to losing out on unemployment and health care, and this fund would address some of the gaps.
“We cannot accept that these folks don’t deserve the same level of health care that other workers deserve,” Vasquez told Source NM. “When it comes to respiratory diseases — not just for them, but for their families as well —  they must be taken care of. Because if we’re going to generate billions of dollars for the oil gas companies, we should also be able to spare enough to take care of the people who actually make those profits.”
Vasquez said Republicans in the administration are using harmful rhetoric and immigration enforcement to threaten U.S. oil and gas security, saying he hopes to offer “a reality shock” to members in Congress.
“They have to also come to accord with the fact that the majority of the Hispanic population here that is now being targeted for deportation from ICE is going to detract from those economic goals of the Republican Party,” he said.

Shows like “Sesame Street” and “Maya & Miguel” were a key part of his early education.

“My younger group, they love it,” he said. “They love it because they know we’re coming with something fresh, something new.”
But because of federal budget cuts pushed by President Donald Trump, Johnson and other Mississippians will lose access to these shows by next summer.
Mississippi Public Broadcasting will lose up to 15% of its annual budget, which is between $2 million and $2.5 million, according to Anna Neel, MPB’s chief operating officer.
She said that by July 1, MPB plans to eliminate programming from PBS, NPR, the Create television channel, the PBS Kids television channel, PBS Kids app and the streaming service Passport.
MPB will still air emergency weather alerts and local programming like “The Gestalt Gardener” on the radio and “Mississippi Roads” on TV, and it will continue to produce all local news, including “Mississippi Edition,” Neel said.
Nationally syndicated TV shows like “Daniel Tiger,” “Sesame Street,” “Frontline,” “Finding Your Roots” and “Antiques Roadshow” and radio shows like “Morning Edition” and “All Things Considered” won’t be available under MPB’s planned changes.
The Republican-led Congress last month approved and Trump signed cuts to federal spending, including a $1.1 billion reduction to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  Trump said in an executive order in May that he believes PBS and NPR have “biased and partisan news coverage.”

CPB helps fund PBS and NPR, and it sends money to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations nationwide, including Mississippi Public Broadcasting. CPB announced on Aug. 1 that it is starting the process of shutting down.
Neel said despite the cuts, Mississippi is in a better position than other rural states because most of its budget comes from state funding. She said CPB’s shutdown was expected and won’t impact the changes already planned.
“At the end of the day, it didn’t go our way,” Neel said. “So, defunded but not defeated, right?”
Republican state Sen. Angela Burks Hill of Picayune said she supports the funding cuts. She said the government should prioritize public safety, corrections and the national debt, and that MPB should replace missing funds with donations.
“We can’t just keep funding everything that we’ve been funding all these years if we’re ever going to hope to keep our fiscal house in order,” Hill said.

MPB started a donor campaign, Won’t You Be Our Neighbor, to try to make up for some of the losses. Neel said many donors reached out to show support and said they’d be increasing their contributions. 
“That donor pie is not enough to make up the $2.5 million deficit that we will see with these cuts,” Neel said.
For the fiscal year that began last month, Mississippi lawmakers put $8.3 million of state money into public broadcasting, listed in budget documents as the Educational Television Authority. That is a decrease of $2.1 million, or about 20%, in state support from the previous year. 
Johnson said he has seen how PBS Kids helps students with academics and social and emotional development. 
“Nothing will be able to replace PBS Kids, simply because it’s a network designed specifically for kids to educate them about how the world is ever-changing,” Johnson said.

Neel said it would be difficult and expensive for MPB to produce children’s educational programming locally. She said she has spoken to teachers in underserved communities who rely on PBS Kids.
“They depend on this free educational content … to help children not just learn to read, learn their colors, to learn their shapes, but they depend on this content to teach children how to regulate their emotions,” Neel said.
PBS says its children’s programming helps improve literacy and STEM skills, and its accessibility helps fill educational gaps: 60% of PBS’ audience lives in rural areas, and 56% of low-income households watch it.
For Johnson, the alternative to PBS Kids is YouTube. Instead of having prepared lessons, staff will have to build their own curriculum.
“I will stand on the highest mountain to say that there isn’t any platform, any network, or any broadcasting service that will replace PBS Kids,” Johnson said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01163944/Mississippi-Public-Broadcasting-4.jpg,,,2025-08-08 16:56:26.671611

Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.

The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.

Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

BURLINGTON — With shovels in the ground and hard hats on, officials chucked soil, throwing up clouds of dust at a construction site off North Avenue Thursday afternoon.
The event celebrated the groundbreaking of 100 Cambrian Way. Come next year, there will be 40 new, permanently affordable apartments in the mixed housing development at Cambrian Rise, in Burlington’s North End, built in partnership with Champlain Housing Trust and nonprofit developer Evernorth. 
The building will run mainly on solar and geothermal power and will not rely on energy generated from fossil fuels, according to Eric Schmitt, CEO of Evernorth.

“But we’re not only delivering on climate solutions,” he said. “100 Cambrian will be a long-term asset to the city. It means that these homes will give families the stability to raise their children here and know that this housing will still be affordable for their children and their grandchildren.”
The new building will be the third to offer affordable housing at the site. Ten apartments have been set aside for families with vouchers from the Burlington Housing Authority, which could help lift recipients out of homelessness. 
The trust and Evernorth completed the 72-unit Laurentide building there in 2019, and Cathedral Square’s Juniper House with 70 apartments for adults 55 and older opened in 2021. 
A fourth building planned — Shale Beach Condominiums — will add 30 permanently affordable condos through the Champlain Housing Trust’s shared equity program, offering homeownership at a fraction of current prices, Michael Monte, CEO of the housing trust, announced at the event.
“These 40 apartments will help people feel safe and secure in a home,” Monte said.

State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said housing is Vermont’s number one economic issue. He has heard from employers who fail to attract or retain talent because it is too expensive for people to rent or buy a home in Vermont, he said. It’s also a social issue, he added.
“The lack of housing is one of the leading drivers for homelessness,” Pieciak said, underscoring the importance of building more homes, particularly affordable ones, statewide. 
Apartment sizes at 100 Cambrian will vary and, on average, cost $1,325 for a one-bedroom, $1,530 for a two-bedroom and $1,840 for a three-bedroom apartment, according to a Champlain Housing Trust press release.

The $23.8 million project has been funded by 14 sources. A third of it came from federal and state tax credits through the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, $8.8 million came from state and federal funds committed by the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, $3 million came from the City of Burlington, and $1 million came from a donor that wanted to help the homelessness situation in the city, according to the release.
It is designed by Duncan Wisniewski Architecture. Wright and Morrissey are the general contractors. Eric Farrell is the master developer of the neighborhood, the release stated.
The new development is part of Burlington’s effort to build 7,200 new homes in 25 years, particularly affordable housing.
The event drew more than 50 partners, politicians and stakeholders to the site on a hot afternoon. 
“Ensuring our community has ample safe and affordable housing is a top priority for my administration,” Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said in the release.

Speakers also noted the opening of Fox Run — a similar climate-friendly 30-unit complex in Berlin on Wednesday. Built in partnership between Downstreet Housing and Development and Evernorth, it is the first new affordable development built in Berlin in a decade, MyNBC5 reported.
As the federal government pursues massive tax cuts, Vermont may receive more federal tax credits to support housing development, said Maura Collins, executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, which administers the federal tax credits.
Collins quoted a song from Hamilton which goes, “What is a legacy? It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.”
“Not all of us are going to be able to be here at the ribbon cutting, and not all of us are going to be able to see the dozens and dozens and dozens of families who live in this building to come,” she said. “But this is a legacy of the good work that is done by all of these organizations.”

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Board of Ethics voted unanimously Friday to make a job offer to its acting ethics administrator eight months after legislators took unprecedented steps to block his hiring. 
The ethics board made David Bordelon its top staff member on a temporary basis in December in order to appease state lawmakers. Legislators filed an unsuccessful lawsuit last fall to try to stop the board from picking a new administrator at that time, and Bordelon’s interim status was considered a compromise. 
Legislators were not objecting to Bordelon personally. The lawsuit was aimed at delaying any hiring until several board positions turned over to new appointees at the beginning of 2025.

When the ethics board hired Bordelon for the temporary position at the end of 2024, it was made up of appointees picked by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and members of the Louisiana Legislature in their previous terms of office. 

Legislators wanted the board to wait to select a permanent ethics administrator until appointees from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and current-term lawmakers had been seated. 
A 2024 law change Landry pushed gave governors and lawmakers more influence over the new people seated on the ethics board.

Previously, governors and legislators’ ethics board appointees were required to be selected from a list provided by leaders of Louisiana’s private colleges and universities. Starting this year, Landry and legislators can now put who they want on the board without outside input.

The board that hired Bordelon this week includes members picked by Edwards and previous lawmakers as well as Landry and current legislators. 

Board chairman Jason Amato, appointed by Landry, has been impressed by Bordelon’s leadership. State government leaders and legislators have enjoyed working with Bordelon, he said. 
As the permanent ethics administrator, Bordelon will have to help the board navigate dozens of ethics and campaign finance law changes approved this year that loosen restrictions on government officials.
Criticism and scrutiny of the ethics board has skyrocketed since Landry took over as governor in 2024.
Landry has had a fraught relationship with the board for years after being reprimanded multiple times for ethical and campaign finance problems. Presently, the governor is negotiating with the board for charges he faces for not disclosing flights he took to Hawaii on a political donor’s private plane while attorney general. 
The ethics board investigates local and state government officials – everyone from the governor to small town employees – for allegations of corruption, conflicts of interest and campaign finance violations. It can fine and charge public servants with violating the state ethics code, though its ability to fully enforce those laws remains relatively weak.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Gov. Tony Venhuizen. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden announced a potential $17 million deal Friday to acquire land for a new men’s prison in northeast Sioux Falls and trade away state-owned land 15 miles south of the city that was formerly chosen as a prison site.
The plan is subject to approval by the Legislature, which is scheduled to convene for a special session Sept. 23.
“South Dakota needs a new prison to keep our people safe, and we are moving forward with delivering a proposal that prioritizes safety and conservative fiscal stewardship,” Rhoden said in a news release.
If approved, the transaction could resolve a controversy over plans to replace the oldest parts of the antiquated and crowded state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.

The controversy dates to 2023 when the administration of then-Gov. Kristi Noem announced the selection of state-owned land in rural Lincoln County, sparking opposition and a lawsuit from neighboring landowners. The fight culminated last winter in the Legislature’s rejection of funding for a prison project at the Lincoln County site. That spurred the new governor, Rhoden, to appoint a Project Prison Reset task force.
The task force, led by Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, worked through the spring and summer considering prison plans and locations, ultimately endorsing a $650 million budget — including land acquisition — for a 1,500-bed facility on one of two large parcels of undeveloped land in the same area of northeast Sioux Falls. The area is bordered by Interstate 229, Benson Road and the Big Sioux River. Neither of the two site finalists encountered opposition similar to the backlash against the rural Lincoln County location.
Rhoden’s chosen site is along Benson Road, south of the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society and a National Guard facility, and north of Gage Brothers Concrete Products. Great Bear Ski Valley is across the Big Sioux River to the southeast. Venhuizen said in a Friday interview that the site is “a little bit better deal” and “a more regularly shaped parcel” that will better accommodate the state’s plans.
The property is owned by TCB LLC, which is registered to Patty Nohr of Sioux Falls. Under the terms of a purchase agreement, the state would pay TCB $12.5 million for its 148 acres of Sioux Falls land. The state would also transfer ownership of its 320 acres in rural Lincoln County — worth an estimated $4.5 million — to TCB, raising the total value of the deal to $17 million.
A fact sheet published by the Rhoden administration says the owner of land neighboring the Sioux Falls site has indicated a willingness to sell an additional 28.98 acres. Venhuizen said the state hasn’t decided whether to make an offer for that property.
“As the design progresses, we’ll ascertain whether that’s necessary or not,” he said.

When the state was planning to build on the rural Lincoln County site, the state was not required to follow county zoning, which was a point of contention in a lawsuit filed by neighboring landowners. Rhoden’s news release said the Lincoln County land will be privately owned and subject to county zoning if his plan is approved.
Prior to the Legislature’s rejection of the Lincoln County site, lawmakers had been budgeting money for several years in anticipation of a prison construction project. Rhoden anticipates having enough state funds to build the project without taking on any debt. The cost of land acquisition is $10 million less than the task force had conservatively estimated, Venhuizen added.
Questions remain, however, about how much of the money spent by the state on plans, site work and infrastructure agreements at the Lincoln County site is recoverable or transferable to the Sioux Falls location. The total amount of those expenditures is more than $50 million.
Venhuizen said the state will “put out a more specific breakdown about that in the next couple of weeks.”
“Quite a bit of it is transferable,” he said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EM8A0469-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

ICE arrests and detentions rise steeply in Idaho

In the announcement, Little said he was activating up to 14 Idaho National Guard personnel to support ICE. Little said Idaho is providing clerical and administrative resources so that ICE can focus on law enforcement.
“As Commander in Chief, I am proud that the Idaho National Guard always stands ready to support our federal partners in any capacity that strengthens public safety and national security,” Little said in a written statement. “Our guardsmen are trained, disciplined, and committed to serving the people of Idaho and the nation.”
 Idaho governor shows support for Trump’s immigration policies

Friday’s announcement marks the latest effort by Little to support and align himself with the immigration policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.
In June, Little announced that the Idaho State Police was partnering with ICE to transport immigrants who are convicted of a crime and who do not have the legal authorization to be in the United States to ICE detention facilities for deportation. 
The first ICE transports under the new Idaho State Police partnership took place Thursday, Little announced.
On Thursday, the Idaho Statesman reported that Idaho State Police is partnering with ICE under the more aggressive “Task Force Model,” not the “Jail Enforcement Model” that Little’s office originally announced in June. The Task Force Model allows Idaho State Police to question people on the street about their immigration status and interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant, the Statesman reported. 
 ICE arrests have spiked in Idaho

There has been a significant increase in the number of ICE arrests in Idaho this year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Compared to the same time period a year ago, ICE arrests in Idaho are up by 797% this year. That’s up from 41 arrests during the first half of 2024 to 368 arrests during the first half of this year, the Sun reported.

“We’ve seen an increased number of calls, typically from loved ones whose loved one has been detained,” Chris Christensen, a Boise immigration attorney, previously told the Sun. “We have seen a lot more immigration holds … and we’ve also seen a lot more aggressive tactics used by local ICE.”

(Mesa County Sheriff's Office)Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires have burned more than 100,000 acres in Colorado so far in 2025.
It’s already Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” currently extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Three Colorado fires have burned at least 10,000 acres in 2025:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 58,714 acres with 0% containment as of Aug. 8. It’s believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, is also believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,518 as of Aug. 8, and is 0% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 49% contained and has burned an estimated 27,477 acres since it was started by lightning on July 10.

Parts of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park also remained closed due to the South Rim Fire, which has burned over 4,000 acres in and around the park in Montrose County.
Gov. Jared Polis has issued disaster declarations for fires in Delta, Mesa, Montrose and Rio Blanco counties. On Aug. 6, he mobilized the Colorado National Guard to support firefighting efforts on the Lee and Elk fires.
Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm


















High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

The Turner Gulch wildfire near Unaweep Canyon northeast of Gateway is burning about 14,000 acres as of Wednesday afternoon.
“This fire remains active and continues to make significant advances to the east as winds become aligned with the terrain. Fire officials are developing a strategy to protect values while providing for safety of firefighters and the public,” said a Wednesday afternoon update from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1.
The fire was caused by lightning on July 10. Winds have stoked the blaze in recent days.

Andre Bauer suspended his challenge to U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham just one month after launching it.
Bauer announced his decision Friday on social media.
“This decision does not come lightly. I entered this race with a servant’s heart — believing that our nation needs leaders who are grounded in truth, integrity, and faith,” he wrote on X. “But I believe now, more than ever, that in order for us to truly move forward, we must stop tearing one another down with lies and division.”
He did not immediately return a call or text from the SC Daily Gazette.
When he announced his bid July 2, Bauer called South Carolina’s senior senator a “war monger and globalist.” He said he intended to campaign as the “real Trump guy,” saying it didn’t matter that President Donald Trump had already endorsed Graham.
On Friday, Graham responded by again pointing out that Trump “proudly endorsed” him.
“I wish Andre and his family well and appreciate his service to our state for many years,” he said in a statement that followed a link to Trump’s post in March on his social media platform Truth Social.
Bauer’s political career included terms as a state House member, state senator and two-term lieutenant governor. But he hasn’t held elected office since 2011, after losing a bid for governor, making him an unknown to many new voters in the state.
His decision not to challenge Graham leaves two Republicans in the race: Greenville businessman Mark Lynch and Paul Dans of Charleston, an author of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Graham’s campaign spokesperson said Bauer’s departure from the race means “it’s abundantly clear that the people of South Carolina and President Trump are united in their commitment to re-elect” Graham.

(Photo: David Davis, County Extension Director, N.C. Cooperative Extension)Multiple Hurricane Helene aid programs in North Carolina are clearing key bureaucratic hurdles, state officials said Friday, as thousands in the mountains await help for their homes and farms nearly one year after the storm.
A new state fund created to reimburse farmers for lost crops has received more than 7,000 applications. And Renew NC, the state’s home building and repair program, is one step closer to funding after a key agreement with federal officials this week.
State lawmakers created the crop reimbursement program as part of a March aid bill. It sets out $300 million to pay farmers for crops that were washed away or destroyed last year. Two-thirds of that money is for Helene-impacted farms, and the rest is for other storms in 2024.
Applications for the program closed in May. The Department of Agriculture received around 7,500 applications total when accounting for incomplete or duplicate ones, assistant commissioner Kaleb Rathbone told the governor’s committee on western recovery.
In the months since, officials have sought to verify all of those applications. Farms will be reimbursed for their losses based on a formula outlined in state law. Payment is expected “mid-summer,” according to the department’s website.
“We can’t send money out for a category until we’ve reviewed and calculated the payments, so that nobody gets left behind,” Rathbone said.
The vast majority of applications — around 6,400 — are for farms affected by storms other than Helene. Of the roughly 1,100 Helene-impacted applicants, 500 of them involve farm infrastructure damage.
Applications remain open through the end of the year, meanwhile, for the state’s primary homebuilding and repair program, Renew NC.
Many home repairs out west have already begun — paid for by a combination of homeowners’ own capital, FEMA’s individual assistance payments and philanthropic groups. But Renew NC will be the state’s biggest effort at restoring damaged homes, primarily for low-income families.
Thus far, only single-family housing is open to applications. The state has received 920 applications so far, said Matt Calabria, director of the governor’s recovery office. Around 350 of those have been deemed eligible and will now move into scheduled inspections.
State officials do not yet have access to the $1.4 billion in federal grant funds that will fuel the program. But they signed an agreement with federal officials this week, Calabria said, a key step toward unlocking the money. Other requirements remain, like environmental reviews, before the money is made available.
“We are on the precipice of a lot of work getting done,” Calabria said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-extension-helene.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Michigan’s U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar introduced legislation Thursday that would strip federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents of their qualified immunity protections, allowing individuals to sue agents who violate constitutional rights.
The Detroit Democrat’s bill, “Ending Qualified Immunity for ICE Agents Act,” comes amid growing concerns over what advocates describe as aggressive enforcement tactics by ICE, particularly in the wake of $170 billion being allocated to the agency with passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping GOP tax and spending measure endorsed by President Donald Trump. 
“Trump’s ICE is following a ‘deport now, ask questions later’ policy,” Thanedar said in a press release. “They are more interested in hitting quotas and racial profiling than they are in treating people with basic respect and dignity. We’ve seen ICE detain Americans with impunity and commit gross civil rights violations. Qualified Immunity protects them from being held accountable. No more. No one should be above the law, especially those entrusted with enforcing it.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects government officials from civil liability unless a plaintiff can prove that a “clearly established” statutory or constitutional right was violated.
Thanedar’s proposal would remove this defense specifically for ICE agents, regardless of whether they believed their actions were legal at the time.
“If an ICE agent violates the law, it only makes sense they are held accountable just like civilians,” Thanedar said. “With Trump allocating an additional $75 billion to ICE, it’s more important than ever that we demand strict oversight and accountability.”
The legislation arrives as reports continue to surface of ICE agents detaining individuals at locations including courthouses, schools, and places of worship, often while masked and without providing clear identification. 
While critics argue that the increased funding of the agency provided under the new law will embolden such tactics and prevent meaningful oversight, the measure is unlikely to gain much traction in the Republican-controlled U.S. House.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

The League’s ballot question committee, Save AR Democracy, will host a launch party for its petition drive from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Aug. 26 at Southern Tail Brewing in Little Rock, according to the release.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Arkansas attorney general certifies League of Women Voters ballot title 


In May, Attorney General Tim Griffin certified the ballot title for the League’s proposed constitutional amendment. The measure would prohibit state lawmakers from changing the Arkansas Constitution themselves and require that any new law affecting the initiative and referendum process must be approved by voters at the next general election.
Additionally, the amendment would permit only voters, not state lawmakers, to propose changes to Article 5, Section 1 of the state Constitution, the section that outlines the initiative and referendum process.
The Legislature would determine the name and title of referendums, and votes on a bill with an emergency clause (a provision that allows laws to become effective immediately) would have to occur at least 24 hours after the bill passes.

Griffin rejected the proposed amendment three times before certifying it. In his third rejection, he cited a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level as his reason for denying certification. This was one of several policies related to direct democracy that drew public opposition during the 2025 legislative session before becoming law.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a federal lawsuit in April alleging that eight such laws are unconstitutional. In July, a judge granted two ballot question committees, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, permission to intervene in the case.

The committees sought to challenge additional laws not included in the original suit, including Act 602 of 2025, the law that prohibits initiative petitions from being written above an eighth-grade reading level according to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula.
Protect AR Rights is a coalition of civic groups behind the Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment, which Griffin certified in July after previously rejecting it under Act 602. The group also filed its own complaint in the lawsuit against the slate of direct democracy laws, many of which put additional requirements on petition canvassers and signers.
Supporters of the new laws have said the requirements will help protect the integrity of the state’s initiative and referendum process.
Proposed constitutional amendments require 90,704 signatures from 50 counties to qualify for the ballot.

It’s the latest development in several years of litigation and back-and-forth over the Sevier Playa Potash Project, which would give Peak Minerals 124,000-acres of mineral rights. The proposal was originally approved by the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, in 2019. 
Potash is a trade name for minerals with potassium used in fertilizer, but also used to manufacture other products like soap, glass and synthetic rubber. It’s often found in the brines of terminal basin lakes, like the Sevier Lake, a mostly dry lakebed in Millard County. 
The project was initially approved under the first Trump administration in 2019, but in 2023 the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued to stop it, arguing the BLM did not analyze all the environmental impacts and failed to consider alternatives that would be less environmentally disruptive. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The BLM and SUWA then moved to jointly dismiss the lawsuit, after Peak Minerals submitted a revised mining plan. But the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning SUWA could re-file its complaint. 
In June, the BLM approved Peak Minerals’ new plan — and on Thursday, SUWA filed a lawsuit in federal court, arguing the approval did not consider all environmental harms, including impacts to groundwater, migratory birds, air quality and dark night skies. The group is also alleging the BLM violated federal law when it authorized the project through a Determination of NEPA Adequacy, which relies on existing environmental reviews rather than conducting a new, more lengthy analysis. 
“By failing to conduct the required environmental analysis for a project of this magnitude, BLM has rubber-stamped a decision to irreversibly alter the extremely wild and remote nature of Utah’s West Desert,” said Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for SUWA, in a statement. “The impacts of turning Sevier Lake into an industrial zone will destroy important habitat for migratory birds, ruin incredibly dark night skies, and imperil groundwater resources for decades to come.”

The lawsuit asks the court to declare the project in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Peak Minerals said the project will bring economic benefits to the area, aligns with President Donald Trump’s executive order to ramp up mineral production, and offers a sustainable supply of domestically-produced potash. 
“Once up and running, it will help supply North America with much-needed potash while replacing imports that have large carbon footprints, doing so at the absolute lowest cost,” said Peak Minerals CEO Dean Pekeski, in a statement after the project was approved in June. 
Peak Minerals would dig trenches to expose the brine and collect water from precipitation and the Sevier River.

The RNC and the state GOP sued the state Board last year after it voted along party lines to allow UNC-Chapel Hill students to use their mobile UNC One cards as photo ID. 
University student and facility IDs, if the state Board approves them, are among the acceptable forms of photo identification voters can use at the polls. Many campuses have replaced physical cards with multipurpose digital IDs. UNC’s was the first digital university ID the state Board approved. 
A trial court last year sided with the state Board, but the state Appeals Court blocked use of the mobile IDs. Students weren’t allowed to use them for the 2024 election. 
As part of the agreement dismissing the lawsuit, the state Board agreed to not approve any more digital IDs unless the legislature passes a law allowing them. 
Democrats held a 3-2 majority on the elections board last year. Republicans now have a majority. 
Two Democrats who voted with the majority last year to allow the mobile IDs are still on the elections board. 
On Friday, they defended their 2024 votes.
“I think that the previous Board made the correct decision to allow that ID, but the Court of Appeals order disagrees and we are bound to obey that,” said Board member Siobhan Millen. “I think with the way technology is changing with digital IDs that this will not be the last word on this subject.”
Democrat Jeff Carmon agreed with Millen.”I know this is something we will see again as we move toward digital driver’s licenses and things of that nature,” he said.

supporting tribal sovereignty, equitable homeownership and generational wealth-building on Indian trust lands,"" the organization says. (Courtesy photo by Tammie Billey / Largo Photography)In tribal communities in the Southwestern United States, the path to owning a home can present obstacles, including a cultural taboo against selling a home; a lack of awareness that doing so is even an option; and the absence of guardrails in the event a real estate transaction goes sideways, says Christopher Billey, executive director of the Tribal Homeownership Coalition of the Southwest.
Billey and his organization’s Program Manager Melinda Williams are scheduled to meet with the interim legislative Indian Affairs Committee at its meeting in Taos on Aug. 14 to discuss removing barriers to tribal homeownership.
Their discussion, Billey told Source NM in an interview on Friday, will include a case study of the first-ever public sale of a home on land owned by the Navajo Nation, which happened in January in LeChee, Arizona and set a precedent for future real estate market development in reservation communities.
An estimated 30,000 homes need to be built on the Navajo Nation, according to the case study, and thousands of Navajo families are on waiting lists for homes. The nation spans New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.

Billey said most tribal leaders don’t understand homeownership because people living within the U.S. reservation system were historically not allowed to buy, trade or sell lands. Even though these transactions do happen today, they often rub up against a core traditional belief among Navajo, Pueblo and Apache tribal members that a home is the center of a family and shouldn’t be sold.
“You have the modern idea of homeownership, and then you’ve got the traditional side, which has been allowed to grow, and when these two ideas come together, people get upset,” he said. “I had a conversation with a Zuni council member who said: ‘We don’t normally do this, we don’t normally sell our homes. We give them to our kids and our grandkids.’”
Another topic Billey said he expects to discuss with the committee is building new homes. Jemez Pueblo and San Felipe Pueblo provide good examples of New Mexico tribes that are expanding housing availability, Billey said, by training their own workers to build housing.
“They’re doing new housing developments in their communities and are able to keep costs down,” he said.
Billey, a licensed realtor and citizen of the Navajo Nation, said in the next 10 years, as more tribal members learn they can sell their homes, he hopes state and tribal governments will enact reforms to protect buyers, sellers and contractors who build homes on reservations whenever the parties disagree.
For example, legislation is needed to allow a real estate transaction dispute to be resolved in either state or tribal court, because most tribal courts have no policies around real estate.
“Building on the reservation is very complicated and there’s a lot of risk involved, so it’s the time right now to start moving that needle,” he said. “This is the moment of change.”

Sarah Stevens' judicial campaign. (Photo by Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)
Bob Hall, former director of the nonpartisan watchdog group Democracy North Carolina and a longtime campaign finance watchdog, filed a formal complaint Friday asking the State Board of Elections to rule that a $6,800 donation from lobbyist Harold Brubaker to Rep. Sarah Stevens’ judicial campaign violates state law.  
The complaint, submitted Friday, followed an NC Newsline story that highlighted a contribution from Brubaker, a longtime lobbyist and former House speaker. The story reported that Brubaker contributed to Stevens’ newly formed judicial campaign committee, “Stevens for Justice,” on June 23 while the General Assembly was still in session.

Hall is asking the Board to declare the contribution illegal and require Stevens to forfeit the money to the state’s Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund, which supports public education.  
“This statute applies whether or not the General Assembly is in regular session,” Hall wrote. “It was also upheld by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals as a reasonable restriction to address possible corruption.”  
North Carolina law prohibits registered lobbyists from contributing to sitting legislators’ campaign regardless of the office the legislator is seeking, and also bars lawmakers from soliciting or accepting such donations. 
“Rather than focus on the office being sought, the statute focuses on the person’s status when the contribution is made — is that person a legislator or not?” Hall wrote. “Put simply, it prohibits any state-regulated contribution from a lobbyist to any candidate campaign committee when the candidate is a member of the General Assembly.”  
Stevens, a Republican from Surry County who chairs the House Election Law and Campaign Finance Reform Committee, converted her legislative committee into a Supreme Court campaign earlier this year. Her race is expected to be among the most closely watched in 2026.

Neither Stevens nor Brubaker have disputed that the contribution occurred. In comments to NC Newsline prior to the complaint, both maintained the donation was legal because it was designated for a judicial campaign, not a legislative one.  
But Hall’s complaint argues that interpretation misreads the law. It also cites a separate $1,500 contribution made in June by lobbyist Andy Munn to Stevens’ judicial campaign, calling for similar forfeiture.  
Hall acknowledged in his letter that both Stevens and Brubaker likely believed the contribution was allowed. “They did not intend to break state law,” he wrote. “However, I believe the contribution should be declared illegal and forfeited, as well as any others from registered lobbyists from early May into August.” 
The complaint underscores confusion that may stem from a wave of lobbyist donations made to then Speaker Tim Moore’s congressional campaign last year. Those contributions were not subject to state restrictions because they went to a federal race. Brubaker, for example, donated the federal maximum of $6,600 to Moore’s 2024 campaign.  
The State Board of Elections has not yet announced whether it will investigate Hall’s complaint. All campaign finance investigations are confidential, according to the Board of Election’s website.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4651-2048x1031-1-1024x516.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Gavin Newsom when he is termed out next year.,"In summary
Kounalakis was trailing in polling and fundraising in a crowded field of Democrats seeking to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom when he is termed out next year.


Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, the first boldfaced name to jump into the 2026 governor’s race more than two years ago, has dropped out and will run for state treasurer instead.
“At this moment, I believe I can make the greatest impact by focusing on California’s financial future,” she said in a statement Friday. “As State Treasurer, I will bring a deep commitment to fiscal responsibility, economic opportunity, and strategic investment in our state’s priorities — from affordable housing and clean energy to infrastructure and education.”
Her decision comes at an odd moment in the campaign for California’s top office. Just last week, former Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she would not run for governor next year, seemingly cracking the unsettled race wide open ahead of the June primary. That same day, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unofficially endorsed Kounalakis in a television interview.
But Kounalakis, who has served as lieutenant governor since 2019, had been sputtering in a crowded field of prominent but low-wattage Democrats. They also include former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Controller Betty Yee, former state Senate leader Toni Atkins, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and timeshare magnate Stephen Cloobeck.
A poll released Friday by Emerson College found Kounalakis running sixth, with only 3% support — behind the Los Angeles billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who has not even entered the race.
And despite significant personal wealth from her background as a real estate developer, Kounalakis struggled to fundraise for a campaign that could ultimately cost tens of millions of dollars to win. She recently reported raising only about $100,000 in the first six months of the year.
In her announcement, Kounalakis emphasized her experience developing housing and said addressing affordability would be a focus for her if she wins the treasurer’s office.
“I will ensure that we efficiently leverage every dollar at our disposal to increase housing production,” she said in a statement. “This work is critical and I am prepared for the challenge.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/091922-ELENI-KOUNALAKIS-MHN-06-CM-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Dialogue but no decision
Lawmakers considered but didn’t pass a major package, SB 7030, this session to address school choice scholarships, including how and when payments should be distributed to schools and families.
In the early days of the 105-day session, school administrators voiced concerns that state money meant to follow students to their schools of choice was at times getting lost, and the state was losing track of where students were enrolled.
At the time of the bill’s presentation, sponsor Sen. Don Gaetz said that at any given time the state cannot locate 23,000 students.
Hendry County Superintendent Mike Swindle told a legislative committee that if the state maintained a universal system to track students’ locations at any snapshot in time, that would “cut out a lot of the forecasting, cut out a lot of voodoo math, if you will, that really creates quite a conundrum for all of us.”
Polk County Superintendent Frederick Heid during the same meeting said, citing a district analysis, that 750 students claiming a school choice scholarship were also taking at least one class at Polk County public schools, resulting in $1.3 million, or 30 teachers’ salaries worth, of funding that is not reaching the school. 
“Fluctuation in funding can affect the continuity of our programs and services offered to students,” Heid said.

Many emergency service providers, in Vermont and across the U.S., work on a volunteer basis or are severely undercompensated, especially those that serve rural areas. “Rescue squads rescue people. We descend from New England Minutemen and town militia, taking pride in public service,” writes Aiken.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Author Aiken’s novels ech[...]","Vermont Author I.M. Aiken can’t stop writing about Vermont and Vermonters. The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County (Flare Books, 2024) stars enigmatic EMT/Paramedic Alex Flynn and explores the psychological toll of responding to 911 calls. In Stolen Mountain (forthcoming 2025, Flare Books), Alex’s mentee Brighid Doran takes over the narrative, turning sleuth to fight crooked ski lodge developers, while continuing to respond to rescue calls. In the ongoing Trowbridge Dispatch series of short stories that focus on the characters’ emotional journeys, set in the fictional town of Trowbridge, Vermont, members of the rescue team take turns narrating their experiences, with results that veer from the tragic (“The Joker”; Flare Books, 2025) to the absurd (“The Curious”; Flare Books, 2025) to the hilarious (“First Corn”; Flare Books, 2025).
Since her main characters are EMS personnel, Aiken’s novels focus on our present health care crisis. The fictional rescue team follows the tiny dramas of emergency calls. While the plights of those in need of medical care are exposed, the focus is on the struggles of these unsung heroes who brave poor conditions, outdated equipment, and bureaucracy to answer their community’s calls for help, in the process putting their own physical and mental health at risk. 
Many emergency service providers, in Vermont and across the US, work on a volunteer basis or are severely undercompensated, especially those that serve rural areas, as noted in a recent video from Vox. Others face disjointed, fractured workplace cultures. This lack of compensation and lack of supportive culture only adds to the trauma, as rescue workers must sometimes leave paid work to serve their communities, only to be demoralized on the job, which makes it all the more difficult to perform their service and maintain their own physical and mental health. 
Thanks to the efforts of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, and others, these issues are front and center today. For instance, the Emergency Service Provider (ESP) Wellness Commission, a 25-person commission, was established in May 2021 “support/aid to all of Vermont’s emergency service providers.” In their 2024 report, the Commission prioritizes ESP wellness conferences and mental health and well-being training; increases awareness of and participation in peer support groups; and has expanded the Worker’s Compensation PTSD presumption laws to include all emergency support personnel sectors. 
While much still needs to be done, and we still need to draw national attention to the crisis in rural health care that we have experienced for years and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future, we can be grateful for the tireless efforts of volunteer EMS and politicians who are working to draw attention to the problem.
We asked Aiken for some background about her work with a couple of candid questions:
Q: Most of your characters take on the role of rescuer. What can you tell us about the theme of rescue in your book?
A: My novels explore my own life. I spent a lot of it as an EMT, firefighter, medic, and crisis manager. I hopped on an inner city ambulance at 20, flew to Baghdad for a year when I was 40, and, after crossing 50, I recognized the impact my decisions had made on me. I have faced sleep troubles, social issues, anxiety, a zealous startle response, and other symptoms that I carry through my days and nights. Laying down at night, I feel underappreciated as I tend to remember the hostilities and trauma of my daily work. In The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County, I asked, “What happens if you are not the hero of your own story?” You spend your life in public service. You’ve saved lives and made a few terrible situations slightly less terrible. You/me/rescuer steps into the spaces most run from. It changes us, sharpens us, tunes us for trouble. It then becomes difficult to turn that off—ever. To this day, I carry a tourniquet, medical gloves, and a trauma dressing everywhere I go. I think I’d like to put that down now. I can’t figure out how to let go.
If rescuers and public servants feel heard, seen, or represented in my books, then I’ve done my job. I am asking readers to understand the sacrifices that we, rescuers, choose to make, the actions we completed, and how this costs us as we age.
Q: The image of a fireman frozen on a ladder in your short story “The Fireman’s Statue” (Flare Books, 2025) is stunning. Where did this image come from? What do you hope readers come away with from this story? 
A: I was there. In this story, a volunteer firefighter climbed a ladder just after midnight on a freezing New Year’s Eve. He anchored himself outside the second story, holding a hose that he used to dowse the upstairs’ rooms. He froze in place and never yielded his duty. I respected him that night while recognizing that this fellow was hated by many and loved by few. Our communities depend on these people and many of us fail to recognize the dedication of people like him.
Recently, one of the kids we raised is still working on ambulances as a medic and volunteers on a rural fire company. Every day, our public service agencies struggle to keep volunteers. The agencies also struggle with unhealthy human dynamics: members hating on each other, meanness, jealousy, pettiness. In a way, the work culture around emergency services destroys these same teams that communities ask to respond to 911 calls.

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone is criticizing Republican colleague Rep. Jeff Van Drew over a congressional plan to gut federal funding for beach replenishment, with Pallone saying Van Drew is not doing enough to save the funds from being cut.
“This is coming from the Trump administration, it’s coming from the Republicans in Congress, and now you see somebody like Jeff Van Drew saying, ‘Oh, it’s not really a problem,” said Pallone in an interview Thursday. “Well, of course it’s a problem.” 
Asked to respond, Rep. Van Drew said he’ll “always” protect the Jersey Shore, and pointed to millions included in the current federal budget for dredging and resiliency projects along the coastline.
“I’ve been working closely with our towns, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the administration to ensure that beach replenishment projects along our coast are fully funded … and we fully expect that to happen,” Van Drew said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
At the center of this battle is a GOP-backed appropriations measure in Congress that would slash funding for the U.S. Army Corps’ beach replenishment projects from the typical $200 million down to $60 million in the new federal fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The proposed cuts would jeopardize projects in Avalon, Beach Haven, and Stone Harbor.
While the Army Corps typically funds projects with some help from local and state money, small Jersey Shore towns can’t foot the bill alone, Pallone said. He noted that towns have to abide by strict requirements and show a cost-benefit analysis to be approved for the projects that, ultimately, save towns money when storms hit. 
“It’s going to cost you more money, because these are only done when you can show that, in fact, it saves money,” he said. “So if you said, ‘No, we’re not going to do it,’ and there’s no resiliency, it’s going to cost more.”
Pallone said the measure, which was voted out of committee but hasn’t received a full House vote yet, would be the first time in nearly three decades that there isn’t enough federal funding to pay for beach replenishment.
Pallone and Van Drew both represent Jersey Shore towns, Pallone in Central Jersey and Van Drew in South Jersey.
Van Drew cited past federal funds he’s brought to his 2nd District for seawalls, living shorelines, beach replenishments, and coastal resilience projects. 
“For five years running, we have been number one when it comes to delivering grants and funding. That hasn’t changed — regardless of whether we’ve had a blue or red administration or whether we’ve been in the majority or the minority in the House,” he said. “Hard work has always gotten the job done. Our record speaks for itself.”
Pallone suggested the cuts are politically motivated to hurt New Jersey because it is run by Democrats. 
“There’s never been this phenomenon where it’s essentially down to zero, and we’re going to continue to fight it,” said Pallone. “I just am disappointed with Van Drew because he suggested that this isn’t happening, and in fact, it is happening. It’s very clear.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Heminghaus_Deal-Beach-Replenishment_20220106_0001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

April 23, 2025. (Courtesy of the University of Nebraska at Kearney)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska will offer a buyout program for eligible tenured faculty this fall as the NU system and individual campuses seek to shore up multi-million-dollar budget gaps.
NU President Jeffrey Gold, announcing the “Voluntary Separation Incentive Program,” or VSIP, on Friday, said it is part of ongoing efforts to position NU “for long-term strength and financial sustainability.” Tenured faculty who are at least 62 years old and have at least 10 years of service with NU by the time of separation in 2026 will be eligible. 
Eligible faculty could receive a lump sum payment of 70% of one year of the annual base salary they are paid as of Oct. 1.
Applications open Sept. 1 and will be accepted by 5 p.m. on Sept. 30. NU intends to allow as many eligible faculty to participate as possible, but campus chancellors, who will review the applications, reserve the right to limit participation. 
Faculty who accept the payment would be ineligible to be rehired at NU during the payout year. Awardees will be notified by Nov. 3. Payments would be made next summer.
“While the VSIP is available only to qualifying faculty members, the program reflects a broader commitment to thoughtful planning and stewardship — work that benefits from the talent and contributions of our entire university community,” Gold said in a statement.
This is the fourth buyout program NU has offered since 2010, the others in 2014 and 2019.
NU is working to close a $20 million budget gap by the end of this fiscal year. Campus leaders will contribute while also trying to close separate campus-specific shortfalls.
  UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett. Sept. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
For instance, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett this week announced that UNL will implement a plan to cut $27.5 million from its budget by the end of this calendar year. He hopes to have a plan finalized by late October to present to Gold. Bennett had said revenue growth has not kept up with costs and had said a buyout program would likely be offered.
The most recent shortfalls follow a series of recent budget cuts for NU and have been made more difficult partly by the slowing of state funding support under Gov. Jim Pillen, who served as an NU regent for 10 years before becoming governor in 2023, and as NU and its campuses face inflation and cuts to federal funding.
Pillen initially suggested cutting NU’s state-aided budget by 2% when deliberations began in January for the state’s 2025-27 budget. The Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee initially approved the cuts. However, federal reductions, in part, led lawmakers to reconsider and accept the result of negotiations between Pillen and Gold.
In the end, state lawmakers approved sending 0.625% more state dollars to NU this fiscal year, up to roughly $700 million, and another 0.625% more state dollars over the new baseline to NU the following fiscal year.
The NU Board of Regents voted 6-2 in June to approve NU’s $1.1 billion operating budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year, which included a 5% tuition increase. The budget-balancing was complicated due to negotiations for faculty and staff salaries. Many staff will not receive pay increases this year, Gold has announced.
Bennett said Monday that the UNL process will include an “intentional review” of academic programs for elimination or mergers to “capitalize on UNL’s existing strengths.” His executive leadership team has proposed teaching and research metrics to evaluate such programs.
Bennett, in a statement, said, “Our goal is for UNL to emerge from this current process a more streamlined, efficient university that retains the profile and impact of a comprehensive, Big Ten, land-grant, research university, continue its significant return of investment for the state of Nebraska and its taxpayers and position us to move forward toward aspirational goals, including being considered for readmission to the AAU [Association of American Universities].”
Gold said he knows some faculty might be considering retirement and that the buyout plan offers a “meaningful pathway” for some of the senior-most faculty, many of whom he said have played a “significant role” in advancing NU’s mission.
“Thank you for your continued service to the University of Nebraska and for your commitment to our mission,” Gold said Friday. “Together, we are building a stronger, more resilient university — one prepared to meet the challenges of today and create an extraordinary future for Nebraska.”

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Democrats in North Carolina’s congressional delegation criticized the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision on Thursday to cut a grant program that would take away more than $156 million from solar projects in the state.
Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative, awarded $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds contributed to solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.
It’s part of the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Democratic Reps. Don Davis (NC-01), Deborah Ross (NC-02), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), and Alma Adams (NC-12) wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the termination.
“At a time when energy costs and demand are both rapidly increasing, it is concerning that your agency is considering an action that may violate federal law — Congress has already appropriated the funding — and would increase household energy costs for millions of Americans while jeopardizing thousands of jobs across a wide cross section of states,” the members wrote.
The four representatives also wrote that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and its coalition partners — the NC Clean Energy Fund, the NC Clean Energy Technology Center, and Advanced Energy — have an award agreement with the EPA to assist with designing and implementing the state’s Solar for All program.
Zeldin posted a video online denouncing the program and saying the cuts would benefit American taxpayers.
“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” he said.
A federal judge ruled in April that the EPA cannot freeze contracts awarded to nonprofits under the Biden administration, States Newsroom previously reported.
That decision could set an example for potential lawsuits due to stare decisis — the legal principle of following precedent in court.
Michelle “Meech” Carter, clean energy campaigns director at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said the program supported at least 12,000 North Carolina households through solar installations and enabled upgrades like repairs and replacements.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, some individuals and households in western North Carolina were without power for days, weeks, and even months.
“Folks in the west desperately need to be more independent with their energy sources,” Carter said. “Installing solar on our most vulnerable homes is what’s going to help us achieve energy independence and support our communities that were affected by disasters.”
Carter described the termination as a “consistent removal of any backstops” for people trying to lower their energy bills or protect themselves from disasters.
David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the program created jobs and lowered residential power bills for families.
“It’s making North Carolina more resilient as it recovers from Hurricane Helene, which emphasized the importance for families to have the choice to power their own homes,” Neal wrote in a statement. “The entire state has a lot to lose if Solar for All is stripped away.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Eight years ago, an H-2A farmworker died after experiencing headaches on the job at Sarbanand. (Finn Wendt/Cascadia Daily News)This article was first published by Cascadia Daily News.
Amid the largest mass deportation in U.S. history, the Trump administration is looking for ways to maintain an agricultural workforce. One option is expanding the H-2A visa program, which is supposed to give farmers another legal way to hire workers in the face of a labor shortage — something the agricultural industry has reportedly faced for years.
However, it isn’t a popular option in Whatcom and Skagit counties. Here, the number of H-2A workers has decreased in the past decade, not increased, as most of the state has seen.
The reduction of H-2A workers in the two counties began after a fatality eight years ago at a blueberry farm in Sumas. This is likely due to strong union presence in the area, where farmworker activists have long claimed the H-2A program lacks wage, health and safety protections. Others in the farming community also attribute the drop-off to union activism, but claim that activism has demonized farms in the area that employ H-2A workers.
Rosalinda Guillén, a longtime farmworker and activist, has fought to protect farmworkers for decades. Federal actions since January have been “more intense than we thought,” Guillén said.
“I mean, the first three months of this year were horrible, with the detentions and deportations of farmworkers,” she said, “but what we need to do is look forward at structural change.”
 A death strikes change 

In August 2017, wildfires tore through the Cascades and turned the skies hazy with smoke. At Sarbanand Farms in Sumas, as temperatures rose and air quality worsened, hundreds of H-2A workers still pressed on picking blueberries.
Honesto Silva Ibarra, a 28-year-old father and H-2A worker from Mexico, started getting headaches on the job. There are conflicting reports of what happened next: One of Ibarra’s colleagues said that Ibarra was made to keep working after complaining of his headaches and eventually collapsed. Sarbanand said Ibarra simply returned to his living quarters.
On Aug. 6, Ibarra died at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Ibarra was a diabetic, and in a subsequent investigation, the Washington Department of Labor & Industries ruled he died of natural causes. Sarbanand was not deemed responsible.
L&I did fine Sarbanand $73,000 after finding that employees were frequently denied work breaks or fed meals later than promised. In June that year, the fine was cut in half.
More than 70 Sarbanand workers went on strike in protest of Ibarra’s treatment. After learning of his death, those workers and many supporters marched in protest of their employer. The protesting workers were all fired.
The number of H-2A workers, who are given a visa to work for a specific U.S. farm for a designated amount of time, more than doubled between 2017 and 2022 across Washington. Whatcom County saw the opposite trend, dramatically dropping from 690 to 78 in the same time span.
Dillon Honcoop, communications director of Whatcom Family Farmers, said that drop was a result of the fallout after Ibarra’s death. Sarbanand, which employed 519 H-2A workers in 2017, mechanized its operations after that year “because that farm had been so targeted by local activist groups despite the fact that they were not to blame,” Honcoop said.
Honcoop said that H-2A workers remain less common in western Washington than in other parts of the state, in large part because the farm work is less labor-intensive.
 Farmworkers unions 

Whatcom and Skagit counties are unique compared to other agricultural areas in Washington because of a strong local farmworker union: Familias Unidas por la Justicia, which has more than 500 members.
Familias Unidas formed in 2013 to fight for worker protection at Sakuma Brothers Berry Farms in Burlington and came to a collective bargaining agreement after four years. United Farm Workers, a longstanding union that spans multiple states, has chapters in other areas of Washington. But Familias Unidas is the only independent union led by local farmworkers.
Familias Unidas helped organize H-2A workers who protested against Sarbanand in the wake of Ibarra’s death. Along with Community to Community, the union has been speaking out against the H-2A program since.
H-2A farmworkers do not have collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act, and employers do not need to “recognize labor organizations” or “engage in any collective bargaining activities.” That makes H-2A workers more vulnerable to wage theft or other abuses, such as inadequate housing or hour violations.
“These are contracted workers imported from Mexico and other South American countries that are brought in here with a visa specifically to work under one specific employer,” Guillén explained.
“So they’re in company housing, no transportation, with a visa for just that farm. And if there’s no rules for safety that can be enforced or monitored, the employer can do whatever they want. It’s like a quasi-slave labor force,” she continued.
C2C and Familias Unidas have successfully advocated for L&I to enforce heat protections for farmworkers, create oversight for workers with H-2A visas and ensure that H-2A workers are being paid competitive wages.
Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, who was detained by ICE in March and chose to voluntarily depart to Mexico on July 14, was a central voice in fighting for those protections. Guillén has repeatedly spoken out about believing that ICE intentionally targeted Lelo for doing such advocacy work.
In 2024, under the Biden administration, the Department of Labor passed a rule to improve protections for H-2A farmworkers. Included in the rule was protection from retaliation by their employers when attempting to unionize. But this June, the DOL suspended enforcement of that rule due to several federal injunctions, it said.
Now, Guillén worries that protections for all farmworkers could be stripped away, while the number of H-2A workers in the counties could grow.
 The future of farmwork 

Though the Trump administration has loudly proclaimed it wants a 100% American workforce, that’s something that Guillén said is unlikely, if not impossible.
“The reality is that there are no local people that can go out and harvest berries right now that are not Latino and Indigenous workers. They just won’t do it. And you know what? They won’t do it because it doesn’t pay enough,” she said.
“And I’ll tell you, the farmers don’t even want to hire them, because they don’t have the skills to pick the berries at the speed of [current] workers,” she continued.
In May, Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse reintroduced a bipartisan bill meant to “stabilize the agricultural workforce”: the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.
The Act aims to streamline the H-2A visa process to expand the number of H-2A workers who are hired, and cap wage fluctuations for up to nine years, meaning H-2A wages could stay low. At the same time, the Act would also require all farmers to enroll in a program to E-Verify the citizenship status of their hired workers, pushing growers not to employ undocumented residents.
The Act also would create a new “Certified Agricultural Worker” status for some undocumented workers, allowing them to legally stay in the U.S. for five and a half years as long as they continue working in agriculture. Certified Agricultural Workers could also eventually qualify for permanent residency, upon good recommendations from their employers.
United Farm Workers has publicly supported the bill, though they opposed capping H-2A wages. But Guillén opposes the bill entirely, saying that giving employers a say in their workers’ qualifications for citizenship makes workers less able to speak out against their employers or seek protections.
Instead of temporary protections, Guillén hopes to see more pathways to permanent residency and citizenship that aren’t tied to a person’s labor.
“We have to survive, yeah, but you can’t just do that. There’s gotta be a strategy for taking advantage of opportunities for the long haul, like, what is our future?” Guillén said.
“We’re not going to be victims. We have to do more than survive.”

More than 60% of Idaho is federal public land. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)A Republican state senator from Nampa said he will introduce a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that would prevent the state of Idaho from selling any future public lands granted or obtained from the federal government. 
Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, said he will introduce the proposed constitutional amendment at the beginning of the 2026 session of the Idaho Legislature, which begins in January.
He hopes the amendment will go before voters in the November 2026 general election. 
“The idea of selling public land really didn’t sit well with me,” Adams said in a phone interview Friday morning. “I have young kids and we like to hike and we like to fish, and our public lands here in Idaho have so many amazing places to do all of those things. Selling it off is just not an option in my mind.”

Access to public lands became a flashpoint this year after U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced an unsuccessful proposal in Congress that would have allowed millions of acres of public land, including in Idaho, to be sold off to the highest bidder. 
Lee ultimately removed his public lands sell off proposal from an earlier version of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” following a public backlash that included opposition from within the Republican Party by U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho.
 How would the proposed public lands amendment in Idaho work?

If the amendment passes, it would create a new land trust and all future new public lands granted by or acquired from the federal government would be placed into that trust, Adams said.

The amendment would not change anything for the roughly 2.5 million acres of state endowment land Idaho already has, Adams said. Under the Idaho Constitution, existing state endowment lands are managed to secure the “maximum long term financial return” to the state and beneficiaries, which means the land can be sold. That’s not changing. 
Instead, the new amendment would apply to all new and future public lands that would be placed into a new trust created by the amendment. That land could not be sold. 
“In this new land trust, there is no provision for maximum financial return,” Adams said. 
Instead, those new lands would be managed to allow for multiple uses, including recreation, timber harvest and grazing. Adams said revenue raised by grazing and timber harvest would support rural schools in communities that are surrounded by public lands and have a smaller property tax base. 
As for the specifics of the amendment, Adams said he will unveil the text of the proposed constitutional amendment during a free, public kickoff event at noon on Aug. 15 at the Pine Cafe in the small mountain town of Pine, which is located in Elmore County and situated along the South Fork of the Boise River. 
Adams picked the spot because he enjoys fishing in the area and Pine is surrounded by public lands, which guests will drive through and experience on their way to the kickoff event.
Adams, a retired U.S. Marine Corps sergeant who saw two combat tours in Afghanistan, said Idahoans have many different reasons for enjoying public lands.
“It’s where I healed when I came back from deploying overseas,” Adams said. “It’s wide-open and you can be all alone. On public lands every man is a king, and it is the only place in the world you can do that. It’s because it belongs to you, and it belongs to all of us.”
 What is the process for amending Idaho’s constitution?

To pass, the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution must receive at least a two-thirds supermajority of support from both the Idaho Senate and the Idaho House of Representatives.

If that happens, the amendment would go before voters in the November 2026 general election, where it would require a simple majority vote to pass. 
Although there is a high bar for amending the Idaho Constitution, Adams said support for public land crosses political lines and he is confident the amendment will receive the two-thirds support in both chambers of the Idaho Legislature.
“It’s a huge issue given the times we are living in, and it’s good to fight for something we all agree on,” Adams said. 
 Public lands have near universal public support in Idaho

More than 60% of all land in Idaho is public land of some form, including U.S. Forest Service land and Bureau of Land Management land.
Public land, where Idahoans and visitors enjoy hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, snowmobiling, bird and wildlife watching, climbing, skiing and more, is extremely popular with Idaho voters. 
In the wake of this year’s proposed public lands sell off, a poll sponsored by Conservation Voters for Idaho found that 96% of all registered voters in Idaho believe public lands should stay in public hands, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Adams told the Sun he began working on his proposed amendment at the end of this year’s legislative session. 
“At that point this idea had legs, but once Sen. Lee proposed selling off millions of acres of public lands, it gave this idea wings and I knew this was the right time to put it out,” Adams said.

(Photo by Lauren Bishop/U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Rhode Island’s second case of West Nile Virus this year was found in a mosquito sample collected in Bristol, state health and environment officials said Thursday.  
A mosquito sample collected on July 28 by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management later tested positive for West Nile Virus at the state laboratory in Providence. 
The first mosquito sample to test positive this year was found on July 21 in East Providence.
A spokesperson with Environmental Management confirmed in an email Friday that the positive sample came from a testing group of 50 Culex pipiens, also known as the common house mosquito. This is the first mosquito sample to test positive this year for West Nile in Bristol, where over nine weeks of sampling the department has collected 1,785 adult female mosquitoes 
The mosquitos in the sample did not test positive for other diseases like Eastern Equine Encephalitis or Jamestown Canyon Virus. So far, West Nile Virus is the only mosquito-associated illness to appear in Rhode Island this year.
West Nile Virus is the most common mosquito-borne illness in the U.S. Most people who contract the virus are asymptomatic, but about 1 in 5 people develop West Nile fever, which can cause headaches, body aches, and other flu-like symptoms.
A minority of West Nile Virus cases can lead to serious neuroinvasive illnesses like encephalitis or meningitis. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 10% of those severe cases are fatal, usually in people over age 60 or those with weakened immune systems.
Preliminary CDC data for 2025 has recorded 140 West Nile Virus cases nationwide as of Aug. 5, with 82 of those cases involving neuroinvasive illness. The CDC notes that because the national database uses data reported by counties, West Nile cases are often undercounted. People who don’t develop neuroinvasive illness are less likely to be reported, which can skew the data toward more severe cases.
CDC recorded 60,992 West Nile Virus cases in humans, with 3,134 deaths, between 1999 and 2024. 
Rhode Island health officials remind residents to protect themselves against bites by wearing insect repellent, long sleeves, and pants, especially when mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Removing stagnant water from yards and outdoor areas reduces the number of places where mosquitoes can breed, and repairing holes in window or door screens can stop mosquitoes from entering the home.
Weekly mosquito testing data is posted to the Rhode Island Department of Health’s website. Additional prevention tips and resources are available at health.ri.gov/mosquito and dem.ri.gov/mosquito.

(Stock photo via Getty Images)A convicted child-killer serving a life sentence in an Iowa prison is suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, insisting that he be deported to Mexico for having come to the United States illegally in the 1990s.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday by prison inmate Juan Ledesma, seeks a court order that will force Homeland Security agents “to come to Anamosa State Penitentiary and take custody” of Ledesma and send him back to Mexico, his country of origin.
In August 1997, Ledesma was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Karen Jasmen Orozco, an infant who lived with her mother, Mirta Medina, and Ledesma in their western Iowa home. Court testimony indicated Ledesma was home alone with the child on Jan. 28, 1997, while Medina was out looking for a job. When Medina arrived home, she found the child vomiting and having seizures in her crib.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ledesma, who worked a night shift at a meatpacking plant, allegedly told authorities he didn’t intend to hurt the child, but she kept waking him as he tried to sleep.
Iowa’s state medical examiner at the time, Thomas Bennett, attributed the child’s subsequent death to shaken baby syndrome, although the defense’s medical expert, Dr. John Plunkett, testified at Ledesma’s criminal trial that the death could have been caused by a 3-foot fall that may have occurred several days prior to the child’s death.
Ledesma was convicted of first-degree murder, child endangerment, neglect of a dependent individual and assault causing serious and willful injury. He was later sentenced to life in prison.
Court records indicate that over the past 28 years, Ledesma has filed at least five applications for post-conviction relief, most recently in 2023, and that all of the applications have been denied.
Lawsuit cites Trump’s executive order 
Ledesma, 52, is now suing the U.S. Department of Justice, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit argues that ICE and Homeland Security have a “duty” to deport him in compliance with directives from President Donald Trump to deport all “illegal aliens.”
In his lawsuit, Ledesma claims he is a “national of the country of Mexico and is an illegal alien,” having come to the United States illegally in 1994. He claims that sometime after being convicted of murder, he was sent to the Anamosa State Penitentiary, where he was visited by ICE agents and signed voluntary deportation documents that remain on file with ICE.
The lawsuit notes that on Jan. 20, 2025, Trump took office and signed an executive order directing Homeland Security and other agencies to pursue the “efficient and expedited removal of aliens from the United States.” The order, the lawsuit argues, requires the removal of “all criminal aliens located in the United States.”










I am not excusing my terrible behavior just because of my youth. No! I take complete responsibility for my own actions.


– Juan Ledesma in a 2019 letter to a prosecutor


Ledesma also argues that he has been declared a “burden to the American taxpayers by the Trump administration,” and that his ongoing health problems are only going to increase the financial burden associated with his continued incarceration.
“By returning the petitioner back to his country of origin, costs to American taxpayers can be focused on lawful citizens,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that Ledesma “has the right to be deported from the United States under federal law and not be further detained without due process.”
Ledesma is representing himself in the case. The federal government has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Ledesma expressed regret in 2019 
Court records show that in January 2019, Ledesma wrote to the Woodbury County prosecutor who handled his case, asking for her assistance, including a letter of recommendation, in his efforts to obtain a commutation of his life sentence.
In his letter, Ledesma wrote: “I want you to know from the bottom of my heart the great sorrow that I feel for the innocent life that I took due to my terrible actions. Sadly, when I was young and stupid, I let my bad temper and emotions take control over me.”
In his letter, Ledesma said that during his 23 years in prison, he had completed his GED, taken computer classes and was transcribing books to braille for the blind.
“I am not excusing my terrible behavior just because of my youth,” he wrote. “No! I take complete responsibility for my own actions. Now that I am older, I can reflect back into  my own life and I can see clearly all the terrible decisions, mistakes and errors that I made back in my youth.”

This story was originally reported by Candice Norwood of The 19th.  Meet Candice and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A group of incarcerated transgender women and men have sued Georgia corrections officials, challenging a new law that prevents them from receiving gender-affirming medical care. The lawsuit, filed Friday morning, accuses the state of violating the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
Five transgender plaintiffs — two men and three women — brought the class action lawsuit on behalf of nearly 300 other people in Georgia state prisons, who argue that the state’s law will have “catastrophic consequences.” In some cases it is forcing trans people who have already received hormone replacement therapy and other services for years to detransition without their consent.
“We are very much in the thick of seeing policies like this be adopted,” said Chinyere Ezie, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which brought the lawsuit with co-counsel Bondurant Mixson & Elmore LLP. “It’s really unfortunate, I think that it has and will cost people’s lives. I think that the plan is to really just eradicate trans people from public life, to really — contrary to medicine — make the treatment of gender dysphoria a culture war, as opposed to a serious medical need that requires treatment.”
In May, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed SB 185, a bill passed by the state’s majority conservative legislature that prohibits the use of state funds or resources for surgery, hormone replacement therapy, cosmetic procedures and other treatments used to address gender dysphoria. The law states explicitly that incarcerated people may still receive treatments like hormone replacement therapy if they are medically necessary for conditions other than gender dysphoria.
Ezie told The 19th that the bill’s sponsors indicated during hearings that incarcerated trans people would not be allowed to pay for treatment themselves, either. Her team has also heard this from their clients, she said. The 19th reached out to the Georgia Department of Corrections to confirm whether incarcerated trans people can pay for these procedures themselves.
“Senate Bill 185 prohibits the use of state funds or resources for the following treatments for state inmates: A. Sex reassignment surgeries or any other surgical procedures that are performed for the purpose of altering primary or secondary sexual characteristics; B. Hormone replacement therapies; and C. Cosmetic procedures or prosthetics intended to alter the appearance of primary or secondary sexual characteristics,” wrote Joan Heath, the department’s director of communications.
“Thus, the GDC cannot use state resources to transport an offender to be seen by a provider paid for at their own expense, nor allow a provider being paid by an offender to treat such offender at a GDC facility,” she continued.
The legal complaint filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights includes details about the plaintiffs who described the effects of being cut off from their gender-affirming medical care. One trans woman named Fantasia Horton, incarcerated in Phillips State Prison, had been receiving hormone therapy since 2019 but was completely cut off following the law, despite being told that her dosages would gradually decrease before ending, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights.
“Due to Defendants’ policies and actions in terminating her treatment, Ms. Horton is now at grave risk of physical and psychological harm,” the complaint stated. “Three years ago, after losing access to hormone therapy for just one week after her prison’s supply of hormone therapy was temporarily depleted, Ms. Horton’s mental health plummeted and her depressive symptoms returned.”
Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized by medical journals and professionals. It is defined as the sense of discomfort or anxiety a person feels when their physical gender feels out of sync with their gender identity. This can lead to long-term mental health effects, including periods of depression, thoughts or acts of self-harm. Forced detransition due to anti-trans legislation, coupled with the poor conditions and discrimination that incarcerated trans people often experience, can worsen these mental health consequences. From a physical standpoint, doctors recommend that any termination of hormone replacement therapy takes place gradually over three to six months, rather than cold turkey.
“Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences,” Jan T. Mooney, an Atlanta-based psychologist, and Mark Spencer, an Atlanta-area internal medicine physician, wrote in an April column about the Georgia bill.
“Abrupt cessation or forced weaning of medically necessary, ongoing treatment is a health risk. Physical effects of hormone withdrawal are accompanied by psychological distress, which may manifest as anxiety, depression, and suicidality,” they continued.
The class action lawsuit comes 10 years after Ezie first sued over another ban on gender-affirming care in Georgia prisons. In that case Ashley Diamond, a Black transgender woman, sued the Georgia Department of Corrections in 2015 after being held in men’s prisons and denied hormone treatments.
The case drew attention from the U.S. Department of Justice, which said at the time that blanket policies barring hormone therapy violate the Eighth Amendment “because they do not provide for individualized assessment and treatment.” Diamond won an undisclosed settlement in 2016, and her case prompted policy changes in Georgia meant to facilitate better treatment of incarcerated transgender people. But six years later, Diamond sued again, asserting that the state failed to provide her adequate health care or protect her from sexual assault after a second incarceration. Ultimately, Diamond dropped that lawsuit to protect her mental health, according to her lawyers.
To see the same issues come up again in 2025 feels like being “in a time machine going back in time,” said Ezie, who represented Diamond 10 years ago.
“I think that is a feeling that’s shared by many trans rights activists,” Ezie said. “It feels like, rather than seeing a forward march of progress when it comes to securing basic rights and basic dignity for transgender people, we are now fighting to hold on to very basic legal wins that you know we achieved, at times, decades ago.”
Ezie and the legal team at the Center for Constitutional Rights are hopeful that the courts will overturn Georgia’s law, as they have in other similar cases. For example, Wisconsin enacted a law in 2005 that barred prison doctors from providing hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgery to incarcerated transgender people in state custody. But a federal court ruled that denying this medical care constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Another state-level class action lawsuit in Colorado resulted in a negotiated settlement agreement between the state and the Department of Corrections requiring an overhaul of how it houses incarcerated transgender women and provides medical care to all trans people behind bars.
If the Center for Constitutional Rights is successful in Georgia, Ezie anticipates that there will still be a long road ahead in the effort to challenge anti-trans legislation and policies.
“We’re going to continue to use the courts, we’re going to continue to organize, we’re going to continue to — as we did prior to the passage of this bill — lobby against bills like this that seek to cause so much preventable harm,” she said. “This is why we fight.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trans-prison_-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

I was 7 years old when those funny-looking characters appeared on our black-and-white TV set. We lived in what the Tupelo city folk considered the country. If there was such a thing as cable, we surely didn’t know anything about it. The only static-free channel on our dial was the NBC affiliate, and that’s because the station on Beech Springs Road was barely a mile from our house. Suddenly, there was this new station – PBS. 
Those funny-looking characters were from this new show called “Sesame Street,” and they had me hooked from the first day. Of course, I was happy to have another TV choice. But this one was different. Skillfully included in the humorous scenes with Ernie and Bert, Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster and Big Bird were educational messages that proved educationally life-changing for my family and me. 
PBS aired “Sesame Street” – the same PBS that helped teach scores of children in our nation, including me, to read. And it’s the same PBS and member stations that just had their two-year forward-funding appropriation yanked by a $9 billion GOP-led rescission bill that finally succeeded in doing what “Sesame Street” teaches against – bullying.

After a long media career, including more than a decade as editor of The Clarion-Ledger, I spent another decade as executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting. It was one of my proudest moments for a kid from Saltillo, a child who came from a family of sharecroppers, to occupy the top seat in public broadcasting in my home state and to ultimately get elected to PBS’s national board of directors.
A kid who admired public media became an executive who ran a statewide operation and helped shape policy nationally. It felt like a dream. 
For those who care as much as I do about public media, it is unfathomable, inconceivable and plain dumb – choose your adjective – that both PBS and NPR stations are being picked on, possibly dismantled. And for what? Their financial impact on the multi-trillion-dollar federal budget is minuscule. The inexplicable action carried out by the GOP majority has hurt me deeply. While Republican members run home on recess to avoid further questions about Jeffrey Epstein, my mind can’t get away from the inevitable obliteration of content from local stations that looms.
PBS and NPR are certainly weakened by the passage of the recission, but it will be the rural stations in rural towns without wealthy donors that will feel the most pain. It is a foregone conclusion that some stations already barely getting by will close. 
One industry executive described the cuts as “catastrophic, devastating, unnecessary and mean-spirited.”  Several stations have already had layoffs and there will be more.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which announced Aug. 1 that it will begin shutting down in September, has been the congressional arm doling out funds to stations since 1967. For years, despite the shortsightedness of some members of Congress, CPB, with the assistance of affinity groups, fought off funding threats and delivered to the 1,500 stations federal dollars that were their lifeline.
Not this time.
The recent action to claw back the $1.1 billion public broadcasting receives over two years is a blow that most likely will place the industry as we know it in an unrecoverable position. 
The public media system and local stations have led the way in delivering some of the country’s best programming. PBS, for example, was among the first to bring to viewers travel shows, DIY content, cooking shows featuring cultural icons like the great Julia Child. There’s also Bob Ross, with his soothing voice, who made us all believe that we, too, could paint beautiful landscapes.
The children’s programming, which my grandchildren faithfully watch, cannot be matched by those with commercial interests. It provides a safe place for children, which is not always the case with the others. 
NPR frequently sets the agenda for the news of the day – often scooping better-financed media companies – with hosts and producers who have a knack for securing interviews with top newsmakers. Their aggressive reporting has always struck a nerve with thin-skinned politicians. As executive director of MPB, it was NPR that kept my phone ringing with lawmakers threatening to pull funding.  
Public broadcasting will survive in some form. It has been wounded, but it has not been silenced. I would not be truthful, however, if I didn’t believe that its strong voice has been reduced to a whisper.
The American people have supported public broadcasting with their viewership and donations, the perfect public-private partnership. But I don’t believe small-town America can keep up. Some larger stations will struggle, as well. 
So many people in my circle of friends have given their entire careers to public media. They won’t give up that easily. But they’ve been dealt a bad hand, a setback that has every station accountant working overtime to save as many people as they can.
What do I predict?
Expect to see mostly national programming and fewer local productions. Expect to see talented radio and TV professionals in the job market. But don’t expect to see public media and the ingenuity of its people give up. They will never quit.

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9%, and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6%, and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed, and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A Washington gun shop is taking its case against the state’s ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Gator’s Custom Guns in Kelso filed a petition this week, asking the high court to review the state Supreme Court’s decision in May upholding the controversial law. Supporters of the restriction see it as an important step for quelling gun violence. 
Walter Wentz, the Cowlitz County store’s owner, said Friday he hopes to convince the Supreme Court justices to “do their job and not accept all these lower courts waving their finger at them.”
“I look forward to exercising our rights,” he said. “Hopefully, we’ll get some justice out of this.”
Gator’s has argued the state’s 2022 ban on the sale of gun ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds violates the Washington and U.S. constitutions. The state constitution protects “the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state.” 
But in their 7-2 decision, state Supreme Court justices ruled high-capacity magazines aren’t “arms,” but just a component of a gun that isn’t generally used for self-defense.
“By restricting only magazines of a capacity greater than 10, the statute effectively regulates the maximum capacity of magazines, leaving the weapon fully functional for its intended purpose,” Justice Charles Johnson wrote in the majority opinion. “Indeed, we can safely say that individuals are still able to exercise the core right to bear arms when they are limited to purchasing magazines with a capacity of 10 or fewer.”
The U.S. Supreme Court has, for years, expanded the understanding of what the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution covers. The justices have ruled the Second Amendment protects firearms that are “in common use” and are “typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.”
In their petition for review, Gator’s attorneys write that Johnson’s opinion “deepens an acknowledged division of authority among federal courts of appeals and state courts of last resort over whether these ubiquitous instruments are ‘Arms’ that cries out for resolution.”
“If this Court does not step in and stop the piecemeal removal of integral firearm components from the scope of the Second Amendment’s plain text, soon neither the piece nor the whole will be left with any constitutional protection at all,” the lawyers wrote.
At the state court level, the gun shop argued the magazines’ popularity meant they met those legal tests. Two of the state Supreme Court justices were sympathetic to this argument.
In 2022, in a case known as Bruen, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled state firearm laws must stay true to the nation’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation.” This left lower court judges to deduce how laws written over a century ago would square with technological advances, like high-capacity magazines and semi-automatic weapons.
The majority from the state Supreme Court didn’t grapple with the Bruen decision because they didn’t find the magazines were considered “firearms” in the first place.
Recent federal court decisions give reason for optimism on the state side. 
This spring, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned down a challenge to California’s similar law on these ammunition devices.
And in June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to Rhode Island’s restriction on high-capacity magazines. 
The Washington law, which has been in effect during the court process, still allows people to own high-capacity magazines, but bans importing or selling them. Over a dozen states have similar restrictions.
The case went to the state Supreme Court after a Cowlitz County Superior Court judge struck down the ban in April 2024. The judge, Gary Bashor, ruled the law violated the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms for self-defense granted in the state constitution. He cited the Bruen decision’s historical tradition test as justification.
In this latest appeal, the gun shop is represented by Paul Clement and Erin Murphy, who also represented the plaintiffs challenging a New York state gun law in the Bruen case. It’s a shift from lower courts, where the Pasco-based Silent Majority Foundation argued for the shop. The two teams will now work in tandem.
Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush, and Murphy didn’t respond to requests for comment. Nor did Austin Hatcher, the shop’s attorney from the Silent Majority Foundation. The state attorney general’s office also didn’t immediately respond.
Pete Serrano, the Pasco mayor and failed Republican candidate for state attorney general, has also represented the shop. The Trump administration is now considering Serrano to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Washington.

Historically redlined communities have less access to rapid emergency medical services, according to the findings of a new study (Brandon Bell/Getty Images).Residents of historically redlined communities experience slower response times from emergency medical services, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to Black and Hispanic residents. The practice deemed neighborhoods with higher proportions of nonwhite residents to be undesirable and financially risky for mortgage lending.
Researchers mapped locations of EMS centers across 236 cities and analyzed maps produced in the 1930s by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The government agency, created as part of the New Deal, consistently ranked majority-Black areas as “hazardous” for lending. Redlining has been illegal since enactment of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968.
The research team calculated average EMS response times using the location of ambulance, fire and rescue services and historical traffic data. “Rapid” response was defined as five minutes or less, the benchmark set by the National Fire Protection Association for high-priority patients with life-threatening conditions.
The team found that more than 2.2 million people lack rapid EMS access. Areas historically graded “D” — financially “hazardous” for mortgage lending — had a significantly higher proportion of residents (roughly 7%) without rapid EMS access, compared with about 4% of residents in historically “most desirable” A-graded neighborhoods. D-graded neighborhoods had higher proportions of Black residents, whereas A-graded neighborhoods had more white residents.
Disparities were particularly acute in the Great Lakes region, the authors note. The odds of lacking rapid access to EMS were nearly three times higher for residents in historically D-graded neighborhoods, compared with A-graded neighborhoods in that region.
The findings add to the evidence linking policies rooted in structural racism to health disparities.
Research has shown redlined neighborhoods still disproportionately grapple with a multitude of health disparities, lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution.
The study found a racial disparity in where EMS stations are located, with fewer EMS stations in urban communities of color. Better tracking and accountability of EMS response times in communities could help address the issue, the researchers wrote.
Delays in emergency care are associated with higher mortality rates. For traumatic injuries, timely care is critical during what EMS professionals call the “golden hour,” or the first 60 minutes after an injury.
Other research has pointed to disparities in emergency response times. EMS response times for patients with cardiac arrest, for example, were 10% longer for low-income ZIP codes than high-income ZIP codes, according to a national study published in JAMA Network Open in 2018.
The study received funding support from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

,Source New Mexico,2025-08-08 17:55:25+00:00,Source New Mexico,Medicaid work requirements don’t work for New Mexicans with disabilities,"Gary Housepian, CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/08/08/medicaid-work-requirements-dont-work-for-new-mexicans-with-disabilities/,The CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico argues that the new federal Medicaid work requirements will harm disabled New Mexicans.,"Changes to Medicaid as a result of the One Big Beautiful Act could result in disabled New Mexicans losing their health insurance, the CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico writes.Just when we thought we’d seen everything, Congress has thrown down a breathtaking new gauntlet: a national work requirement for people participating in Medicaid.  Every state will now be required to track the employment status of its Medicaid recipients in order to receive federal funding for the program.
We don’t know exactly how New Mexico will enact this new rule.  The “One Big Beautiful Bill” does not prescribe how to set up such a tracking system, and it certainly doesn’t fund it.  But every U.S. state will need the system in place in extremely short order, most likely by late 2026.
There are a lot of unknowns, but what we do know is this: Work requirements don’t work for people with disabilities.
As CEO of Disability Rights New Mexico, I have seen how every year, we provide free legal services to thousands of people with disabilities across our state. We exist, in part, because the systems designed to support people with disabilities are so often unnavigable.
Now, Medicaid will erect a new barrier that many people with disabilities won’t be able to scale.  The new legislation requires that Medicaid recipients prove that they work, volunteer or attend school for 80 hours each month as a demonstration of worthiness for coverage.  If people fail to report, their health care is cut off.  There may be some exceptions to the work requirement for folks with medical issues or parenting obligations. But whether or not they are required to work, we are profoundly uneasy about the ability of many people to navigate a reporting system that requires regular check-ins and submission of documentation. Even if someone is entitled to a medical exemption, they don’t necessarily have the ability to provide regular proof of it.  
Consider the following common scenarios:
A young man with an intellectual disability works in a warehouse, where the predictable routine and structure support his ability to succeed on the job. He is enrolled in Turquoise Care, New Mexico’s basic Medicaid plan. Despite working 80 hours each month, his disability makes it impossible for him to regularly report his work hours to the state. Even though he is meeting the requirements, he loses his health coverage simply because he cannot navigate the reporting system.
A woman with traumatic brain injury meets the medical criteria exempting her from work. However, her disability deeply impacts her executive functioning skills to the point where she is incapable of filling out the exemption forms, scheduling a medical appointment to certify her status and regularly submitting the required documentation. Because of impairments caused by her disability, she loses her health care.
These aren’t hypotheticals. These are real examples of the many disability-related obstacles faced by real New Mexicans. And a lot more people are about to be impacted.
According to New Mexico’s Health Care Authority, HCA, New Mexico has 836,000 enrolled in Medicaid, approximately 40% of New Mexico’s population. Approximately 254,000 Medicaid members would be subject to the bill’s new work requirements. Although the details of exemption requirements have not been disclosed, we can expect a significant number of this group could lose coverage, not because they are unwilling to work, but because the policy ignores real world barriers. HCA estimates that nearly 89,000 will lose coverage for vital health care. We expect that number could be significantly higher, particularly in the rural areas where work and volunteer opportunities are limited. Added to that reality is the limitation of transportation of essential transportation services. As if those were not enough barriers to overcome, there is the new six-month redetermination requirements that pose an additional threat to maintaining continuing eligibility, especially for those with disabilities attempting to continue to meet paperwork requirements.  They will be subject to a confusing and punitive federal reporting mandate.  These individuals will need ongoing support to navigate the new rules and how to follow them.  
‘More paperwork for everyone’: NM Medicaid program braces for more churn

We shared these concerns with U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) at a recent Medicaid roundtable, and he has taken action to try and right the ship on Medicaid. The entire Congressional delegation has been supportive of New Mexicans regarding the consequences of these Medicaid changes. We ask that other state New Mexico lawmakers and state leaders do the same, recognizing the chaos and harm that will be unleashed by this new federal mandate and taking steps to do something about it. We call upon our state’s leaders to develop, fund and support an employment reporting system that is as accessible, inclusive and fair as possible. We cannot allow the Medicaid system to punish the very individuals it was established to support by depriving them of essential health care services.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/medicaidgettyimage-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 13:56:27.027924

Tony Evers signed the legislation on Friday. (Screenshot/WisEye)As expected, Gov. Tony Evers signed legislation Friday that clears the way for nurses with advanced training to practice independently.
“Nurses play a critical role in our healthcare workforce, and I’m proud of our work to expand opportunities for nurses to not only grow their career but create a system that allows for more advanced practitioners here in Wisconsin,” Evers said in a statement released Friday announcing his plans to sign AB 257, the advanced practice registered nurses (APRN) legislation, now Wisconsin Act 17.
The bill creates a new license category and a professional pathway for nurses who qualify to practice independently.
The Wisconsin state nursing board will oversee the credentialing of advanced practice nurses, a group that includes certified nurse-midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners.
Advocates said the measure will increase the availability of health care providers, particularly in parts of Wisconsin where doctors are scarce.
Evers vetoed previous versions of the bill in 2022 and 2024. Both times he expressed support for the concept but insisted nurses should meet tighter qualifications before they can practice on their own.
The bill he signed Friday adds those requirements — increasing the amount of supervision that an APRN must have under a physician to 3,840 hours before practicing independently; adding additional supervision requirements for certified registered nurse anesthetists who specialize in pain management; and including language to restrict the titles APRN practitioners use so patients aren’t confused about their credentials.
The Wisconsin Medical Society cited those issues in opposing APRN bills in previous legislative sessions, and with the 2025 revision shifted its stance to neutral.  
In floor votes in June, lawmakers from both parties stressed the bipartisan compromise reflected in the measure that was presented to Evers this week.
In his announcement, Evers thanked lawmakers for their work on the measure, including Republican state Sens. Patrick Testin and Rachael Cabral-Guevara, Republican state Rep. Tony Kurtz and Democratic state Rep. Lisa Subeck.
He also thanked “the many nursing and physician groups that we worked with to get this bipartisan bill across the finish line to help bring more folks into the healthcare profession and ensure that Wisconsinites get the high-quality care they need when they need it while setting our nurses up for success.”
Evers is expected to take action on other legislation Friday. On Thursday the Legislature formally sent nearly two dozen bills that passed in May and June to the governor for his signature.
This report is developing and will be updated.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, faced criticisms for his 2020 social media post about the Iowa caucuses Friday while he toured with state Democratic leaders and met with Iowans at the Iowa State Fair.
Though the Democratic nominating process no longer begins in Iowa, the state fair is traditionally a stop for presidential hopefuls as they consider a campaign. Gallego said a run for president is currently “out of the question,” saying his focus was on his family and supporting Democrats in the 2026 midterms.
Gallego still fielded questions on his previous statements about the process for nominating a Democrat to run for president during his State Fair visit. Gallego, 45, made social media posts in 2020 and 2021 that criticized the Iowa caucuses, the state’s contests that formerly kicked off the nation’s presidential nominating cycle for both parties. While the Iowa Republican caucuses still lead the calendar, Iowa Democrats were booted from their first-in-the-nation position following the 2020 election cycle, after delays reporting 2020 caucus results heightened existing criticism from Democrats that the in-person caucus system was inaccessible.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a post on Feb. 3, 2020 — the night of the Iowa Democratic caucus — Gallego wrote “F*** caucuses. Iowa failed time to move on.”
Speaking with reporters at the fair, Gallego said he has a different approach to the Iowa caucuses than he did in 2020 in part “because I’m a mature adult now” — but declined to weigh in on the future of the Democratic nominating calendar moving forward.
“What I said was, you know, dumb of me,” Gallego said. “No, look: really, in 2020, a lot of us were just very frustrated with the results. And … whatever happens in the future, it’s going to be left up to the DNC. But the Democrats do need to compete in rural America. And you know, Iowa needs to be part of that key no matter what.”
As the Arizona Democrat toured the fairgrounds with Iowa Democratic Party chair Rita Hart and state Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, members of Turning Point USA, a conservative political action committee, followed them, holding up signs of his tweets.
Though he spoke about the caucuses, Gallego said his visit to Iowa was a part of an effort to “reinvigorate the Democratic Party,” saying the party needs to return to a focus on working-class issues and families in order to win back Congress and the White House.
Gallego wrote an opinion piece Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, criticizing Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Sen. Joni Ernst for their votes in support of the budget reconciliation bill that included cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. He highlighted Ernst’s statement, “well, we all are going to die,” made at a May town hall and a video where Miller-Meeks did not respond to questions from Alex Lawson, executive director of the organization Social Security Works, on her decision to support the measure.
“Ernst and Miller-Meeks gave up on Iowa,” Gallego wrote. “I won’t.”
Gallego said Democrats faltered in the 2024 election because their messaging did not reflect the struggles American families were facing with inflation and issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But he said the budget reconciliation bill gives Democrats an opportunity to correct course.
“The really bad bill that just passed gives Democrats an opening, because we could finally really show (what) Democrats are here for,” Gallego said. “We’re here to help those that are, you know, barely making it. That bill is going to push tens of thousands of Iowans off Medicaid. It’s going to really hurt rural hospitals … and they did it for a small group of people that are going to be able to have the benefits of a tax cut — many which aren’t in Iowa. And so this is the opportunity where we need to lean in.”
Republicans criticized Gallego, with National Republican Campaign Committee Spokeswoman Emily Tuttle saying Gallego “isn’t here to fight for Iowans, he’s fighting for his own political ambitions.”
“From mocking Iowa values to pushing policies that would destroy Iowa’s economy, it’s clear he doesn’t understand or care about what matters to Iowans,” Tuttle said in a statement. “While he plays politics, Mariannette Miller-Meeks is delivering real results for working families.”
In addition to visiting the state fair, Gallego said he had visited the JBS meatpacking factory in Marshalltown earlier Friday. He is also scheduled to hold a town hall Saturday with the state Democratic Party in Davenport.
As he visits Iowa, the Institute for Middle East Understanding, a nonprofit organization, announced a TV and digital ad buy in Iowa during Gallego’s visit, criticizing the senator for skipping a vote where a majority of Democrats voted to block the sale of U.S. weapons to Israel.
IMEU Policy Project Executive Director Margaret DeReus said in a statement Gallego failed a “critical test” by skipping the vote, saying the Democratic Party “cannot risk the 2028 election by nominating any candidate who refuses to stand with Democratic voters who overwhelmingly say Israel is committing genocide and support restricting weapons to Israel.”
“We hope Sen. Gallego and any other Democrats with aspirations to be president will understand: The old status quo is over,” DeReus said in a statement. “If you refuse to join Democratic voters in calling for weapons to be cut off to Israel, you’re out of touch with the party and not a credible option to be its presidential nominee.”
Gallego said many of the votes he has missed recently are because he is on paternity leave for his son, born June 13. But he said he believed the U.S. needed to focus on two things — “bring the hostages home, end this war” in resolving the Israel-Hamas conflict. He also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government for starvation and the lack of aid entering Gaza.
“Netanyahu and Israeli government has a responsibility, an absolute responsibility, to actually be feeding and caring for Gaza while they are occupying the country,” Gallego said. “It’s not something that I’m saying.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Former Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola holds a commanding lead in the 2026 election for governor of Alaska if she chooses to jump into the race, a new survey from progressive pollster Data for Progress (DFP) shows.
Peltola, who was elected to Alaska’s at-large U.S. House seat in a 2022 special election and then to a full term in the House before losing her seat in 2024, is widely viewed as the most formidable potential Democratic candidate for either governor or U.S. Senate in 2026. She was the first woman to represent Alaska in the U.S. House, the first Alaska Native person elected to Congress and could be the state’s first Alaska Native governor.
“I think that’s a huge thing, not just for representation, but for policy and people’s lives,” said Jason Katz-Brown, an Alaska-based senior adviser at DFP.
Peltola had the highest favorability ratings of major Alaska politicians in the survey, which was shared first with The 19th. She holds a net positive favorability of 9 points, and leads a crowded field of lesser-known and less popular Republican gubernatorial opponents by double-digit margins.
Katz-Brown said Peltola’s focus on issues like fisheries management and opposing the proposed merger of grocery chains Kroger and Albertsons has made her especially well-regarded among voters.
“She’s done a lot to deserve being so popular and being in such a strong position,” he said.
DFP conducts regular surveys of Alaska. In 2024, the organization’s polling accurately captured the margin of President Donald Trump’s victory in the state and the tight race for U.S. House that Peltola went on to narrowly lose to GOP Rep. Nick Begich. The most recent poll surveyed 678 likely voters from July 21 to July 27 with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Alaska votes solidly Republican on the presidential level, but its politics have a unique independent streak: over half of registered voters aren’t affiliated with either major political party, and both chambers of the state legislature have a majority ruling coalition made up of both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.
Incumbent Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited, setting up an open governor’s race. And with Democrats out of power, all eyes are on Peltola, who joined the legal and public affairs firm Holland & Hart in March and has not yet publicly made moves toward entering either race.
“The policies that she spent her whole last two years running on, especially on fisheries policy, are really, really popular things in Alaska, and the policies of the Republican governor are extremely unpopular,” Katz-Brown said. “All that’s combined, I think, really backs up the people in the state who really want to see a Peltola governorship.”
Several Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom and conservative activist and businessperson Bernadette Wilson, have declared or taken steps to launch campaigns while the Democratic side of the field remains open. Elections in Alaska are conducted with top-four nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice general elections.
The survey included a ranked-choice general election simulation of Peltola and several other declared and potential candidates, and in every round, Peltola came out far ahead of the competition.
In the first round, 40 percent of voters said they would rank Peltola first, 11 percent said they would rank Wilson, and 10 percent said they would rank Dahlstrom with other candidates in the single digits. When all other candidates were eliminated and their votes reallocated, Peltola would beat Dahlstrom by 30 points, 65 percent to 35 percent, in a head-to-head competition.
“This poll makes clear she’s in an extremely strong position to run for governor,” Katz-Brown said. Even “in the most pessimistic of scenarios,” where “not sure” votes are allocated to Dahlstrom or Republican voters rank four Republican candidates and their votes aren’t exhausted, Peltola comes out on top, he said.
Peltola would benefit from Dahlstrom being largely unknown and unpopular in the survey, and a fractured Republican field, Katz-Brown said.
“I think it reflects that the Republican Party is literally years away from unifying around one candidate, and has a ton of work to do,” he added.
In the 2026 Senate race, 46 percent of voters said they would rank GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan first, and 45 percent said they would rank Peltola first. But Katz-Brown said defeating Sullivan, a second-term incumbent who won reelection by 13 points in 2020, would be a much tougher lift for Peltola than an open governor’s race.
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski didn’t entirely rule out making a run for governor herself in recent comments to local media. But that potential bid could be threatened by her cratering favorability ratings.
The DFP survey found Murkowski’s net favorability has plummeted by over 20 points since the organization’s last poll conducted in the spring, following her controversial vote for Republicans’ massive party-line tax cut and spending legislation, which Trump dubbed his “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
In DFP’s last Alaska survey released in March, Murkowski had a slim net positive approval rating, with 49 percent of respondents holding a favorable view of her and 48 percent holding an unfavorable view. In the July survey, 37 percent of respondents held a favorable view of Murkowski, while 60 percent held an unfavorable view, putting her favorability rating at net negative 23 points.
Murkowski cast a critical vote for the megabill, which passed 51-50 with Vice President JD Vance breaking a tie, following the addition of several provisions and carveouts beneficial to Alaska. After voting for the legislation, Murkowski stated that she hoped the House would make changes to the bill, calling it “not good enough for the rest of our nation” and “not ready for the President’s desk.”
But House Republicans made no such changes to the Senate-passed bill, sending the legislation to Trump’s desk by the July 4 deadline he set for lawmakers. Murkowski later told the Anchorage Daily News that she felt “cheated” by Trump signing executive orders that undercut one of the concessions in the bill that she negotiated, a 12-month window preserving tax credits for wind and solar energy projects.
Murkowski, who has served in the Senate since 2002, has historically drawn much of her support from Democratic and independent voters. She’s frequently broken with Trump and in 2022, she defeated a Trump-backed Republican challenger to win another six-year term. While her net negative favorability ratings among Republicans stayed consistent between the two most recent DFP surveys, her net favorability among Democrats fell by nearly 40 percentage points from 63 percent in the spring to 26 percent in July. Among independent and third-party voters, her net favorability fell from 12 points to 21 points underwater.
“I think her run for governor could also be imperiled by having really no base of support anymore,” Katz-Brown said.
Peltola has ample time to make a decision about her political future before the June 2026 filing deadline for governor. On July 1, the day the Senate passed the megabill, Peltola spoke out against the legislation.
“We can not [sic] secure Alaska’s future by increasing healthcare and energy costs for regular Alaskans, so millionaires, like many of my former colleagues in Congress, and their billionaire donors can get even richer,” she wrote on social media. “Yes, let’s develop Alaska’s resources, but for the benefit of all Alaskans, not just a few.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC02302-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 13:56:27.027924

The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

A $50 million annual revenue loss resulting from the Big Beautiful Bill spurred the request. 
The post Republican lawmakers urge Wyoming’s federal delegation to give state larger share of coal royalties appeared first on WyoFile .","About a week before President Donald Trump’s Fourth of July signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the co-chairmen of the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee made a request of the state’s congressional delegation.
Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, asked the delegation to consider either amending the bill or bringing future legislation to avoid a $50 million annual revenue loss for the state. 
In return for the bill’s rate reduction to federal mineral royalties for coal, the two lawmakers asked that Wyoming get a larger slice of the pie that’s usually split down the middle with the feds.
“Thank you in advance for any efforts to consider the financial impacts on the distribution of these revenues and align a revision to the federal-state share in harmony with the proposed royalty rate reduction,” Bear and Salazar wrote in a June 25 letter obtained by WyoFile. 
Companies pay royalties to the federal government for minerals extracted from federal lands. Generally, those dollars are split 50-50 between the feds and the government of the state in which the mineral production took place. 
In Wyoming, those royalties have long built schools and paved roads, and they continue to help fund K-12 education, city and town services and the University of Wyoming. 
The Big Beautiful Bill, however, reduced the federal royalty rate for coal from 12.5% to 7%. Supporters of the legislation, including Wyoming’s delegation, hailed the reduction as a way to boost coal production. But state forecasters estimate the rate reduction will cost Wyoming roughly $50 million in annual revenue, and it’s not expected to be offset in state coffers.

The coming revenue hit concerned Rep. Bear, former chairman of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus. 
“Enough so that I sent a letter to our Federal delegation asking them to change the percentage split between the feds and the state,” Bear said. 
More specifically, Bear and Salazar asked the delegation to consider either amending the Big Beautiful Bill or crafting separate legislation to temporarily modify the mineral royalty sharing from its traditional 50-50 distribution to a share that would give 12.5% to the feds and 87.5% to Wyoming. 
No amendment was made, but Sen. John Barrasso’s staff responded with a letter, telling state lawmakers they would look into it. Plus, Bear said there are plans to follow up with the delegation to see if they are interested in running a bill. 
To be clear, Bear said, he supports the rate reductions.
“That move is similar to our cutting their severance tax,” he said. “Unfortunately, it puts us in a bigger bind on school finance.”
Education funding 
Extractive industries pay severance taxes to Wyoming for removing, extracting, severing or producing minerals. Like royalty dollars, severance taxes are in part used to pay for education. 
In 2022, the Legislature reduced the state’s severance tax rate from 7% to 6.5% before reducing it once more to 6% earlier this year. Together, the two bills cost the state $20 million in annual revenue loss, while their stated purpose was to boost coal production, which has dwindled from its boomtime days.

Efforts like the rate reduction and the severance tax cuts “improve the competitive environment for coal production from Wyoming’s world-class mines and offer the promise of extending the financial viability of robust Wyoming coal production well into the future,” Wyoming lawmakers’ letter states. 
Still, Bear and Salazar wrote, modifying the rate share “is consistent with long-standing concerns to avoid reductions to Wyoming’s revenue generated from coal, oil and gas from administrative fees, congressional sequestration, and similar efforts to reduce Wyoming’s revenue from our treasured extractive resources.”
U.S. Sens. Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)North Dakota utility regulators have recruited support from their counterparts in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana to oppose electric grid upgrades from the transmission operator that delivers power to their states and across the nation’s midsection.
Partisan points have worked their way into the debate, with some Republican public service commissioners voicing their distaste for grid plans that involve renewable energy.     
On July 30, the North Dakota Public Service Commission filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding the issue of who benefits more when major power line projects are built and whether the calculations to determine those benefits are fair. 
An organization called the Midcontinent Independent System Operator manages a regional electric grid that services 15 states and parts of Manitoba, Canada. In December, MISO revealed 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion. The projects are part of an annual plan MISO develops every year to identify maintenance and upgrades for its infrastructure. All of the projects are in the MISO-North subregion, and the costs will be allocated to those states.
North Dakota regulators argue the benefit calculations used for the projects are “unjust and unreasonable” for customers in the state, according to a news release they issued Thursday. They have garnered support for their stance from other MISO network members, even though the southern states won’t have to pay for any of the projects.
While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, said.
Although the complaint is already technically filed, Louisiana still has to ratify it, and partisan lines have already been drawn. Republicans hold a 3-2 advantage on the state Public Service Commission, which meets next Friday.
Lewis said he plans to vote against ratification and rejects the premise of arguments Republican commissioners are making. 
“This has nothing to do with Louisiana paying for things up in the north,” Lewis said. 
The federal complaint relies on a hypothetical situation that the cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, a Republican, said he believes it’s a real concern. 
“We are not allocated the costs of the transmission projects now, but the precedent and the possibility of a future cost re-allocation that could impact us were factors that prompted us, Mississippi and Arkansas to join in,” Coussan said, adding that he’s closely considering the idea of Louisiana leaving MISO altogether. 
Commissioner Mike Francis, also a Republican, said there’s “a lot of windmill projects” up north that only benefit the local area up there.   
Although the complaint is an argument against transmission costs, it specifically mentions that some of the proposed power lines would hook up to renewable energy generation. 
North Louisiana power line project revived after lawmakers halted it

Lewis said North Dakota and Montana regulators are underscoring the presence of wind turbines in MISO-North in an attempt to turn their complaint into a partisan issue that can drum up support from other states. 
“That’s exactly what they are doing,” Lewis said.
During its meeting Thursday, North Dakota Public Service Commissioner Jill Kringstad, a Republican, said the slate of 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.
She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota.
Kringstad and her colleagues estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades.
Commission Chair Randy Christmann, also a Republican, said there could be additional costs for increased power generation on top of the transmission projects.
They said MISO has changed the way it evaluates the cost-benefit of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.
MISO spokesman Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South. 
“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The [proposed] portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”

Gov. Greg Gianforte reminded Montanans on Friday about two new laws that provide Montana homeowners with property tax relief, including new tax rates and rebates.
“Recognizing the burden of rising property taxes, we worked with the Legislature to deliver permanent and meaningful property tax relief,” Gianforte said in a news release. “I encourage all eligible Montana homeowners to visit getmyrebate.mt.gov starting August 15 to claim a rebate before the application period closes on October 1.
“It’s critical that homeowners claim their rebate this year as you may be automatically enrolled into the lower Homestead Rate next year.”
Rebate, tiered tax rates
Senate Bill 542, carried by Sen.Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, establishes new, tiered tax rates to deliver property tax relief for Montanans for their homes, small businesses, farms, and ranches in 2025.
It also provides a property tax rebate for Montanans for their primary residence. Eligible Montana homeowners may qualify for the rebate — up to $400 this year — for property taxes paid in 2024.
To qualify for the rebate, taxpayers must have owned and lived in their home for at least seven months and paid property taxes on the residence in 2024.
To claim it, taxpayers may apply at either getmyrebate.mt.gov or by paper form by Oct. 1, 2025.
“The fastest way to get your rebate is to apply online,” said Montana Department of Revenue Director Brendan Beatty in a statement from the Governor’s Office. “Make sure to apply by the deadline of October 1.”
The application requires the physical address, geocode (go here for help identifying the geocode), amount of property taxes paid as shown on the property tax bill, and the names and social security numbers of the taxpayer and any spouse.
The Department of Revenue has created tools on getmyrebate.mt.gov to aid taxpayers in compiling this information, including a video demonstrating how to find a property’s geocode. The department will process claims as they are received, the news release said. 
For additional information about the property tax rebate or to check on the status of your property tax rebate, visit getmyrebate.mt.gov.
Montana homeowners who claim and receive a property tax rebate in 2025 may be automatically enrolled in the Homestead Rate for 2026, provided the homeowner did not move or change ownership in 2025, the news release said.
Homestead rate
House Bill 231, carried by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, establishes the Homestead Rate.
Recommended by the governor’s bipartisan Property Tax Task Force, the Homestead Rate is a new, lower property tax rate for long-term rentals and primary residences, “the places Montanans call home,” the news release said.
If a homeowner did not claim a rebate, moved, acquired a new residence, or was previously ineligible for the rebate, they must apply to claim the Homestead Rate through the Montana Department of Revenue from Dec. 1, 2025, and March 1, 2026.

Bill Lee announced Friday.
The waivers sought would also allow SNAP recipients to use benefits to purchase hot prepared chicken, including rotisserie chicken and grilled chicken. Fried or breaded chicken would not be eligible.
The proposed changes “will ensure SNAP fulfills its intended purpose of promoting healthier eating habits, supporting improved health outcomes and reducing chronic conditions for low-income families,” according to a news release from Lee’s office.
The proposed waivers include:

Allowing SNAP recipients to purchase hot prepared chicken, including rotisserie chicken and “non-fried, non-breaded items like grilled chicken tenders”
Excluding items that list sugar, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, or similar caloric alternatives as the first ingredient
Excluding beverages in which carbonated water and sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or similar caloric alternatives are the first two ingredients

The USDA has already approved waivers for 12 states, most of which used the waivers to restrict the purchase of soda and candy.
“I’m grateful to the Trump Administration for its leadership to Make America Healthy Again, and thank our grocery retailers, convenience stores, food producers, and beverage manufacturers for working to ensure that healthier choices reach every community across our state,” Lee stated in the news release.
Nearly 734,000 Tennesseans received about $1.4 billion in SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2022, with an average monthly benefit of $161 per person, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
SNAP funding cuts tied to new work requirements approved in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” are projected to reduce SNAP benefits by 20% for Tennesseans, totaling a loss of about $250 million. It’s not clear when these work requirements will go into effect.

Hurricane Debby brought rainstorms and high winds along Florida’s Big Bend area. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A nonprofit smart growth advocacy organization, 1000 Friends of Florida, is the latest entity calling for the Florida Legislature to repeal portions of a new law designed to expedite post-disaster rebuilding.
The measure (SB 180), sponsored by Pinellas County Republican Nick DiCeglie, initially was hailed as a support for homeowners in providing clear, streamlined permitting requirements to ensure families can make the repairs they need without being hit with higher tax bills.
The bill also increased disaster management planning, emergency resource coordination, financial transparency, and reporting across state and local government disaster management bureaucracies.
However, it’s since become the most controversial new measure signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year. The problem? Language barring new local land-use or development regulations considered “restrictive or burdensome,” even if they are completely unrelated to storm recovery.
And the law covers every part of the state, starting retroactively from August of 2024 and going up to October 2027. That’s listed in Section 28 of the law, which says that the new land use laws applies to each county listed in the Federal Disaster Declaration for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, or Milton “and each municipality within one of those counties” last year.
The law specifically says that “any person” can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue on belief the local government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If the government chooses to repeal the restriction, any case would be dropped. If it declines to repeal, that person can go ahead and file a lawsuit.
“This legislative overreach ties the hands of communities striving to address urgent environmental, growth management, and disaster resiliency challenges,” said 1000 Friends of Florida president Paul Owens in a press release on Thursday.
“By undermining local authority, SB 180 puts Floridians at greater risk from flooding, pollution, and unchecked sprawl. We urge lawmakers to act swiftly to repeal these harmful provisions in 2026.”
The law is already having an effect far from its stated original intent to help local residents harmed by a storm. Last week, the Florida Department of Commerce notified Orange County that its new Vision 2050 comprehensive plan — eight years in the making — violated state law and was “null and void.”
That Vision 2050 plan largely updated the county’s guidelines to discourage suburban sprawl and the development of still-untouched rural areas, touching on issues like affordable housing, transportation, and environmental protections.
James D. Stanbury with the Florida Commerce Department’s Bureau of Community Planning and Growth cited language establishing that counties and cities listed in the federal disaster declaration for one of last year’s hurricanes “may not” propose or adopt “more restrictive or burdensome amendments to its comprehensive plan.”
Orange County officials say that they intend to meet with department officials soon to “gain a clearer understanding of their concerns and to receive guidance on next steps.”
Meanwhile, other local governments are scrambling to adapt.
On Tuesday, the Manatee County Commission unanimously authorized staff to collaborate with government regulation staff of Pasco County on submitting a legislative proposal that might “fix” the problems the law has created for local governments, the Bradenton Times reports.
In Volusia County, council members this week voted to request changes for next year’s legislative session.
Deltona City Commissioner Dori Howington doesn’t want to wait until next year to have Tallahassee work on the issue.
“What’s happening is. we’re seeing lawyers lining up to basically attack ordinances that developers have not liked seeing implemented, and as a result, the lawsuits are stacking up against us,” she said. “Anything that you do regarding land use, building codes — anything can be challenged.”
Speaking with members of the St. Petersburg City Council last month, DiCeglie, who lives in a beach community in Pinellas County, spoke about his intentions with the legislation. He was motivated, he said, by the way some local governments came up short in helping residents following last fall’s hurricanes.
“Make sure that the residents know what that plan is when it comes to permitting,” he said.
“What that place is when it comes to storm debris collection. When that plan was not in place [last year], and folks were looking and knocking on the door at City Hall and nobody is answering the door. Nobody is answering the phone calls,” he continued. The fact that local governments are not answering the call of their taxpayer to me was a complete disgrace and an ultimate failure.”
DiCeglie acknowledged that the regulation language was “very broad.”
Fort Lauderdale attorney Jamie Cole has reached out to several local governments about a potential lawsuit challenging some provisions of the law. Although he was unavailable for comment, an associate with his law firm told the Phoenix, “We are hearing from many cities and counties from all over the state, concerned about the impacts of SB 180 and considering whether to join in a lawsuit.”
The Deltona City Commission hasn’t taken a vote yet on whether to join that coalition, Howington said, but likely will consider it soon.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.
“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
 Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
 A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)Violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, according to a new FBI report, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
The declines continue a trend seen since crime surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homicides jumped nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest one-year increases since the FBI began keeping records in 1930. By 2022, violent crime had fallen close to pre-pandemic levels.
Homicides, which the FBI classifies as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, dropped nearly 15% in 2024. Reports of other violent offenses also decreased, including rape by 5.2%, robbery by 8.9% and aggravated assault by 3%.
Property crime also fell across all major categories, with motor vehicle theft down 18.6%, burglary down 8.6% and larceny-theft down 5.5%. Reported hate crimes decreased 1.5% from the previous year.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

The 2024 report draws on submissions from 16,675 law enforcement agencies — 2.1% more than last year — representing more than 95% of the U.S. population. Every city agency serving a population of 1 million or more people provided a full year of data. Participation in the FBI’s crime data collection is voluntary, and the data is based on crimes reported to police.
About 75% of participating agencies submitted information through the FBI’s new, more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, which covered 87% of the population.
The data release marks a shift from recent years when participation lagged following the FBI’s 2021 transition to the new system, which required many law enforcement agencies to invest in training and technology upgrades. In 2021, national reporting rates fell below 70% for the first time in two decades, forcing the FBI to estimate results for many jurisdictions.
The FBI’s crime trends report also includes new law enforcement safety data. Sixty-four officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2024, 43 officers were accidentally killed and 85,730 officers were assaulted.
Although the FBI’s 2024 report is a year behind, it aligns with other crime trend reports. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, recently found that homicides and other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, fell in the first half of 2025 across 42 major cities compared to the same period in 2024.

Notably, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said during Thursday’s status conference that he’s planning an in-person visit next week to Blossom Apartments, where third-party utility JXN Water shut off service after the owner said he wouldn’t pay over $400,000 in unpaid water bills. The judge also said he wants to have the complex’s owner, Tony Little, appear in court.
But most of Thursday’s status conference focused on Jackson’s sewer contract with Veoilia, which has managed the city’s three wastewater treatment facilities and pumping stations for the past nine years. Jackson has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 over it’s sewer system failures, which include polluting the Pearl River. Wingate placed the sewer operations under JXN Water in 2023.

Earlier this year, WLBT reported, JXN Water manager Ted Henifin clashed with city leaders after he decided to replace Veoilia with Jacobs Solutions, the firm that already manages the city’s water treatment services. Jacobs is set to take over the contract in October. Veoilia’s contract was set to end in November, 2026. 
Henifin, along with several Jacobs employees, attempted on Thursday morning to enter the Savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant to meet with Veoilia regarding the transition. But Veolia staff denied Henifin and the Jacobs employees entry, saying they no longer wanted to have their pre-scheduled meeting. 
Matt Johnson, Veolia’s Vice President of Operations, told Wingate that the meeting would have been disruptive to daily operations, and that he didn’t understand the “business sense” of Henifin’s decision to end the contract contract early.

Welch, vice president and client account manager of Jacobs Engineering Group, speaks about Jacobs running the City of Jackson’s water treatment plant operations during a press conference at Hinds Community College in Jackson, Miss., Friday, February 24, 2023.

Henifin said going with Jacobs would save about $800,000 a year, largely because they already have staff in the area. Johnson contested that it would cost $1.2 million to $1.6 million to end its contract early, but Henifin disputed that number, saying Jacobs would attempt to retain all of Veoilia’s staff.
The manager also criticized Veoilia’s performance.
“I’m a little dumbfounded they’re continuing to push this,” Henifin said, arguing the company neglected Jackson for roughly seven years before only recently turning things around.
Johnson, as well as representatives for Jackson, pushed back on Henifin for not going through a competitive process for choosing a new sewer contract, arguing Veolia could have competed with Jacobs’ price if there was an open bidding process. Jackson interim chief administrative officer Pieter Teeuwissen, speaking on behalf of the mayor’s office, agreed that a request for proposals, or RFP, would benefit the city by providing transparency and boosting trust in JXN Water.
The federal order that appointed Henifin over the water and sewer systems allows him to bypass laws around bidding contracts as well as public records. The manager has said before that an RFP process would be expensive and time-consuming.

Wingate made no ruling regarding the contract itself, but told Veoilia that Henifin should have “unfettered” access to all sewer facilities going forward. 
At the end of the status conference, Wingate said he would soon address the question over whether to put Blossom Apartments and another abandoned complex into receiverships.
Representatives with the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, one of the intervenor plaintiffs, asked whether there was any way to turn water on at Blossom Apartments for just the weekend as Wingate decides how to proceed. Organizer Danyelle Holmes described “inhumane” conditions at the complex, where tenants haven’t had running water for over two weeks. Henifin responded that, short of the judge ordering him to do so, he wouldn’t restore service, emphasizing that neglectful property owners need to face consequences.  
Earlier this week, Mayor John Horhn told reporters that the city is providing potable water to residents as officials work to relocate tenants. 
Horhn also came out against Henifin’s proposal to increase water rates, which Wingate is waiting to rule on as he finds out how the city spent money from its Siemens settlement.
“I’ve gone on record with the judge saying that I’m not in favor of a rate increase,” Horhn said at a press conference. “The people of Jackson are suffering enough under the water availability fee for example, just in order to qualify for getting water, you have to pay a $40 availability fee and a lot of residents have a lot of push back on that.”
The mayor mentioned the potential to reallocate federal funds to help pay for daily water operations. While Henifin has said he’s asking federal officials to do just that, he’s maintained a rate increase would still be necessary.

A new law in Illinois makes tax credits available to help alleviate news deserts.

Forty Illinois local news entities operating 120 outlets are receiving $4 million in state tax credits under a new law designed to encourage the retention and hiring of journalists, according to documents released this week.

The organizations that have received credits represent a cross section of Illinois’ local news ecosystem, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information request by the Medill Local News Initiative.
They span major legacy organizations, small community newspapers, digital start-ups and public broadcasters. Most of the funding went to organizations outside the Chicago metro area. Nonprofit outlets received 30% of the money. The vast majority of news organizations in Illinois are for-profit.
“What I see is what appears to be a very efficient program at delivering public dollars to a broad range of community news organizations covering almost every corner of Illinois,” said Matt Pearce, director of policy at Rebuild Local News, a nonprofit advocacy group. “I think that’s reflected in the fact that this is a subsidy built into the tax code, and it’s accessible to any eligible publisher.”

So far in Illinois, 61 entities have applied for funding with 49 of those approved. Five applicants had their applications denied and seven more applications remain under review. The Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity did not immediately provide a response to written questions about who was denied and why.
Absent from the list of recipients were the nation’s two largest publishers of local news: Gannett, which publishes 11 dailies in the western and central parts of Illinois, and Alden Global Capital, the investment firm owner of the Chicago Tribune. It’s unclear if they applied and were denied or chose not to apply. Representatives of the companies did not respond to written questions.
The legislation attempted to cap the amount of funding to organizations backed by private funds like Gannett and Alden. One such company, Lee Enterprises, still managed to be the largest recipient of Illinois’ tax credits at $375,000 across applications it submitted for four newspapers in the state.
Earlier this summer, Illinois became the first state in the nation to distribute money directly to local news organizations for employing journalists. The Illinois law is the latest step in the growing movement of state and local governments using legislation to intervene in the local news crisis, even as the federal government clawed back $1.1 billion in funding for public broadcasting last month. Twenty-two states and municipalities have passed or are considering bills to support local news, according to Rebuild Local News.
Medill’s State of Local News Project tracks more than 200 counties without a source of professional local news and an additional 1,500 with only one remaining news source. That covers half of all counties and more than 53 million Americans. Illinois currently has five news desert counties and has lost 45% of its newspapers since 2005. The state lost 54% of its newspaper employees in the decade ending in 2023.
“I think this confirms there’s a great demand, a great need for local media outlets to receive this assistance,” said Illinois State Senator Steve Stadelman (D-Rockford), who chaired the bipartisan Illinois Local Journalism Task Force that studied the crisis and issued a report early last year. “I’m really pleased that we’re getting money out the door already.”
Illinois’ legislation, passed in May 2024, makes available $25 million over five years for local news organizations that hire and retain journalists in the form of refundable tax credits. In its first year, $5 million is available in tax credits broken into two buckets, with $4 million earmarked for retaining journalists and the remaining $1 million for newsrooms that add new journalists. A little over $1 million remains available in 2025, with 78% of the credits for expanding newsrooms unclaimed.
The credits are distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis. To receive funding, outlets must apply and demonstrate eligibility based on certain criteria, including consistent publication of original local content and employment of journalists.
In the closest parallel, New York allocated $90 million over three years for local journalism in its 2024 budget. But that program has stalled in the State Assembly and none of that money has reached New York newsrooms yet.
Don Craven, the president of the Illinois Press Association, expressed satisfaction with the roll-out of the program, while noting that there’s still work to be done to not leave money on the table.
“I know our members who got tax credit certificates were dancing in the aisles,” Craven said.

[…]","The Florida Supreme Court building. (Photo by Colin Hackley)Gov. Ron DeSantis has yet to fill a vacant judgeship in Northeast Florida, and the American Civil Liberties Union is asking the Florida Supreme Court to intervene.
After Eighth Judicial Circuit Judge Mark Mosely announced his retirement earlier this year, the judicial nominating commission for the circuit delivered a list of candidates to the governor. The Florida Constitution requires a governor to appoint a judge within 60 days after he receives the list.
ACLU attorneys representing Gary Edinger, a resident of the judicial circuit, filed a motion in the state high court Friday arguing that DeSantis has violated the Florida Constitution by taking longer than 60 days — the deadline elapsed on Aug. 3 — to name a replacement.
“If the Governor fails to fill this vacancy by August 18, 2025, his appointee may evade the electors until the 2028 election,” Edinger’s attorneys argue in a 14-page petition.
The difference between an appointment before or after Aug. 18 is the difference between the new judge’s first election happening in 2026 or 2028, they contend. Primary elections are scheduled for Aug. 18, 2026. Per the Constitution, appointees don’t need to stand in an election happening less than a year from the date of appointment.
Further delay could give the appointee an “extra two unlawful years” to serve, the motion argues. 
The circuit covers Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Gilchrist, Levy, and Union counties. Mosely had served since 2004. 
“The Governor’s failure leaves the court without a full complement of judges, burdens the People of Florida who rely on a fully functioning judiciary for the efficient administration of justice, and threatens to prevent the Circuit’s voters from having the opportunity to vote on the Governor’s appointee at the next election if he does not fill the vacancy by August 18, 2025 — ten days from today,” Edinger’s attorneys wrote. 
Last month, DeSantis was sued for the same thing in the Second Judicial Circuit, covering Leon County and the surrounding area. DeSantis filled that position seven days after the suit was filed and 11 days after the date constitutionally required.
“However, as explained below, this case warrants an expedited decision by this Court since Petitioner and other Circuit voters will be prejudiced — and indeed irreparably harmed — if the appointment is unlawfully made so late that the appointee is not up for election at the next election, in 2026,” Edinger’s attorneys wrote.

Free.,New lawsuit presses DOJ to release communications about Epstein files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-lawsuit-presses-doj-release-communications-about-epstein-files,,"WASHINGTON — A nonprofit government watchdog sued the Trump administration Friday for failing to respond to public records requests for communications between the White House, Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation about Florida sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including any review of President Donald Trump’s past relationship with the financier.The lawsuit came as the White House continues to face fallout following the Department of Justice’s refusal in early July to release what are commonly referred to as the Epstein files.According to reporting by CNN, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Vice President JD Vance met Wednesday evening at the White House to discuss next steps in addressing the growing scrutiny.The Democracy Forward Foundation filed the lawsuit in district court for the District of Columbia alleging the administration violated the Freedom of Information Act for not responding to the organization’s expedited request within the legally required 10 days.The nonprofit is requesting the court order the DOJ and the FBI to provide a determination and turn over any non-exempt files, including email communication, calendar invites, and Slack and Microsoft Teams messages among officials who reviewed Epstein investigative files this year. The organization also requested records containing information about Trump’s communication with Epstein dating back to 1990.“President Trump has repeatedly said he would release the Epstein files, his spokesperson claims his administration is ‘the most transparent in history,’ and yet, they continue to hide from the American people. The only thing transparent about the Trump-Vance administration is how clearly they continue to disregard our nation’s laws,” Skye Perryman, Democracy Forward’s president and CEO, said in a statement Friday.“Public records laws outline a clear and simple process that requires the government to immediately produce important documents in response to urgent public information requests, and yet again, this administration is ignoring the law. The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation.”The White House and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.DOJ says no Epstein ‘client list’ existsThe Trump administration’s handling of Epstein case material has come under a microscope since an unsigned Department of Justice memo on July 7 declared “a systemic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” and department and FBI officials concluded that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”The DOJ’s refusal to release further information sparked criticism among Trump’s voter base, and even among some administration officials. The memo also roused both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress, who are now demanding records be released and ex-government officials testify under oath about the investigation into Epstein, who died in a New York City jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, avoided tough votes compelling the release of Epstein records by sending lawmakers home early for August break.The House Committee on Oversight, chaired by Kentucky Republican James Comer, issued several subpoenas Tuesday to past U.S. attorneys general and former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Epstein surrounded himself with powerful figures through the years, including Trump and the Clintons. A July 23 Wall Street Journal report revealed that Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein files. The context in which Trump’s name appears in the investigative material is not clear.In response to failing to fulfill his campaign promise to release the Epstein files, Trump ordered the release of grand jury testimony from the Epstein investigation. A Florida judge swiftly denied that request.Ghislaine Maxwell interviewThe president also dispatched Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to a Florida prison to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse girls. Details of the interview have not been made public. Maxwell has since been moved to a minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas.The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed Maxwell for an Aug. 11 interview and rejected her recent request for immunity, according to media reports.

Among many other things, the bill included a tax on remittances, which refers to the money immigrants send back to their home countries. This tax was intended to discourage illegal immigration while also raising revenue for the government. Although the tax is only 1%, its impact is not negligible: in aggregate, $100 billion in remittances were sent from the United States in 2024. 
In Connecticut,  16% (1 in 6) of the state’s population is foreign-born immigrants. Based on national averages, over half of them are expected to send remittances back to their home country. When applied to Connecticut’s population, this means that over 300,000 people in this state alone are likely sending remittances. 
These remittances are crucial to many of the countries receiving them. For example, they account for around 25% of GDP in Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, as well as about 20% in Guatemala. Since a significant portion of American remittances is sent to these Central American countries, it is vital to understand how the tax will affect all aspects of their economies and communities. Given their dependence on remittances, any policy affecting these flows has significant consequences. 
While there are ways in which the tax may offer marginal long-term economic benefits for receiving countries, it is ultimately designed in a way that harms impoverished families and disproportionately penalizes immigrants who are positive contributors and play by the rules. 
The tax will have two direct effects: it will reduce the amount of remittances sent and channel them through informal networks. The tax makes it more expensive to send money to a relative, thus making people decide against it. However, instead of not sending the money, people may send it informally. Formal remittances are either sent through a Money Transfer Operator (MTO) or a typical bank, making them easy to tax. However, informally sent remittances are typically delivered in cash by hand– either by the sender, a relative, or a paid contractor. This not only makes informally sent remittances impossible to tax, but also makes them untrackable—and thus easy to use for illicit activity. In fact, the tax was set at only 1% because policymakers feared that if it were any higher, it would encourage the use of informal channels. 
A tax on remittances is not always bad for the countries receiving them. Although remittances often help families in need, they can be damaging to economies, especially those of countries with high poverty rates. When strategically utilized, a tax can mitigate many of the negative impacts of remittances. 
For example, a tax only on remittances sent through MTOs can help increase investments while limiting illegal activity. Investments are an economically productive way to spend remittances, yet due to the dire situation of people receiving them, only 1% of remittances are allocated toward this purpose. The other 99% is used for consumption (usually of necessities), which creates a long-term reliance on remittances while also having inflationary impacts. 
Taxing remittances sent through MTOs incentivizes senders to use banks instead, giving banks more money to finance loans, which people can use for investments. Additionally, money sent through MTOs can be picked up in cash with limited identification, allowing illegal operations to use them. For example, drug smugglers can bring substances into the country, sell them, and then send the profits back to their home country to help fuel the cycle. A tax on MTOs would disrupt this illegal activity and make it less profitable. However, such smugglers would still be able to continue their activity by either paying the tax or finding a way to send money illegally. 
The tax included in the bill, though, was not just for MTOs, but for all remittances sent from the United States. This may still contribute to reducing reliance on remittances abroad in the long term, but it will also harm families living in poverty in the short term. Unlike a tax only on MTOs, this offers almost no untaxed alternative for senders (though there are a few rare exceptions). To be fair, the tax is small, but given the value of American dollars in the receiving countries, the financial loss is far from negligible. The primary intent of the tax is to discourage illegal immigration, and it was initially planned to be levied only on undocumented immigrants. However, the bill was later amended, and in doing so, the tax now reflects a broader—and arguably less focused—policy choice, drifting from the original rationale. Additionally, for the undocumented immigrants who are affected, the tax will only penalize those who send money through legal channels while failing to address those who bypass the system entirely. 
Overall, when a policy is enacted, it is essential to remember the original intentions. If the point is to discourage illegal immigration, then it would make more sense to levy the tax exclusively on undocumented immigrants, even if that means raising the percentage of the tax. If the purpose is to specifically discourage shady activity funded by the remittances of undocumented immigrants, then a tax only on remittances sent through MTOs might be more effective. Lastly, if the goal is to mitigate the adverse economic effects on the receiving countries, the most effective approach may be to influence the policies adopted by those countries, encouraging them to prioritize economically productive spending and take measures to prevent illegal activity. 
Because of this tax’s lack of precision and focus on a specific issue, hard-working American immigrants and their families may be harmed, including the nearly 600,000 in Connecticut.

The state hasn't had any new measles cases reported in about three weeks. (Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas reported no new measles cases for the third week in a row Wednesday, and health officials are encouraging parents to vaccinate their children as they return to school next week to keep that trend going. 
The lack of new cases puts Kansas about halfway through the 42 days required for a measles outbreak to be considered over, which is two incubation periods of 21 days each, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Close proximity in classrooms creates the ideal environment for the spread of measles, considered the most contagious vaccine-preventable disease, said Karen Winkelman, public health director for the Barton County Health Department. 
She said county health officials maintain a strong working relationship with schools, which helps speed communications if there is a measles case.
“With measles, it’s going to be quick action, quick notification,” she said, adding that they’re also encouraging schools to adopt and teach strong hygiene practices.
Handwashing, good practices when sneezing and coughing, and encouraging parents to keep their children home when they have symptoms are among the practices Winkelman highlighted.
“Also review immunization records, making sure they are properly and appropriately vaccinated, and also just being honest, up front,” she said. “We’re not going to force vaccination, but we want you to know what the consequences are if there would happen to be an exposure.”
With a 21-day incubation period, an unvaccinated child who has been exposed may not be able to attend school for that time period.
School vaccination data from 2025 isn’t available yet, but many Kansas school districts last year reported decreased vaccination rates, according to Kansas State Department of Education data. For instance, the Gray County kindergarten vaccination rate dropped from 76% in the 2022-23 school year to 66% in 2023-24. Stevens County dropped from 98% to 83% in the same time period.
Ninety cases of measles have been reported in 12 Kansas counties since January, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment data. Most of the cases, 87, are related to an outbreak, which occurs when three or more cases are linked to each other. 
The last new Kansas measles cases were reported during the week of July 6. 
“Certainly we can hope that the current outbreak situation is improved and nearly ending,” said Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System.
But Hawkinson said measles cases continue to increase at the national level. The CDC reported 1,356 confirmed cases of measles as of Wednesday.
Communicating about the importance of vaccines continues to be important, he said. Many people still quote information that has been thoroughly researched and debunked, Hawkinson said.
“There have continued to be publications which continue to support the safety and benefits of vaccines, but especially the (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,” he said. “There continue to be new, updated, well-done studies that show the safety of these vaccines.”
Hawkinson referenced a recent Denmark study of 1.2 million children born between 1997 and 2018 that found no association between minute amounts of aluminum in vaccines and long-term health impacts.
“I think we have to continue to promote honest science and transparency, and it is a battle against disinformation, which has persisted and really grown in the past few decades,” he said.
Hawkinson said vaccine information has become intertwined with political and societal views.
“When we’re talking about our mechanic or our lawyer or our electrician, we will listen to them and take their advice,” he said. “But when it comes to the most important thing, we are finding it harder and harder, as a society, to take the advice of those people and those experts who are dedicating their lives and their training and their every day to giving accurate information and trying to keep individuals and communities healthy.”
Hawkinson said it’s important for parents to make informed decisions about their children’s health, and to also consider that an illness like measles can have an economic impact in terms of missed work and medical costs.
Before the measles vaccine was available in the 1960s, most people were infected with the measles virus, with about 400 to 500 people dying each year; 48,000 being hospitalized; and 1,000 suffering from encephalitis, or brain swelling, the CDC website said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2202122534.jpg,,,2025-08-08 12:57:28.716050

I was down on my hands and knees working in my garden. I glanced up to see Donna standing calmly above me. “We need to go to the emergency room,” Donna said, leaning on a cane, her leg stiff, the right side of her face drooping, her eye enlarging.
“You’re having a stroke. Get in the car right away!” I dashed into the house to grab my purse. Out my window, I could see the windmill repairman heading through Donna’s pasture gate, but I didn’t have time to deal with him. In minutes, we were speeding the 15 miles to the nearest hospital.
Donna and I, two English, or non-Amish women, have lived side-by-side in the middle of the Old Order Amish region for years. I moved into an old Amish schoolhouse in 1988, and fixed it up into a livable abode. The schoolhouse still held one lonely desk in the middle of the large room with layers of dust on the floor. There were two bathrooms, a boys’ and a girls’. I knocked down a wall, installed a shower, and created one restroom.
The schoolhouse had a long counter under the south windows. When I ran a sponge over the top of the counter, big chunks of linoleum came off in my hand. So, I ripped out the counter and installed a sink and cabinets. I went to the used appliance store and purchased an apartment-sized stove and refrigerator. Voila! I had a kitchen.
I began cooking meals, feeling right at home, except for one thing. The green house right next door. Here I was in the middle of nowhere, and I had another house butting up against me. There was an Amish phone booth in the garage of the house. Five or six families shared the phone there, and I loved the comings and goings this created.
My Amish neighbors pulled into my drive, hitching their horses to a couple of old T-Posts on my property. The Amish can use a phone but can’t have one in their house where it would inevitably ring whenever they sat down to a family dinner.
Harriet, the owner of the green house, didn’t care for the Amish and complained that they ran up her electricity bill through the one bare bulb that hung down from the ceiling in the tiny phone booth. Over the course of the year, there was a stand-off with Harriet scattering cinders and even some broken glass in her lane to prevent the Amish from using the phone.
“Darn it,” I said to myself one evening when I was doing my dishes. “Here I am in a beautiful neighborhood, except for that woman who lives in the green house. And the house is right next to me.”
Then after a year, a FOR SALE sign went up in front of the green house, and soon Donna and her husband Stu moved in. They painted the green house yellow. They cleaned up all the cinders and glass. They took an old flag pole down and made it into a hitching post, welcoming the Amish.
“Whoa, this was better,” I thought. My only complaint was the bright yard light that Stu installed. It ruined my stargazing, but I tried to let that go. I resisted the urge to shoot out the yard light bulb with the slingshot I kept on hand to drive away diseased cats and raccoons.
“When we moved into our house,” Donna told me years later. “I thought everything was perfect except for that old schoolhouse right next to us. And why would that woman be living in that old wreck of a building? I wish we could get rid of her.”
The day of her stroke, I stayed at the hospital with Donna, moving through various tests with her, an MRI, then a CAT scan, waiting for the neurologist to appear on a little TV screen beside her gurney. Finally, Donna was admitted to the hospital floor, and her son and daughter-in-law who had just gotten off work, stepped into the room.
Donna had been a city mouse, raising her family in an urban area until her five children were grown. Then she talked Stu into moving to the country. Once here, she quickly transformed into a country mouse, leaving her children to scatter to other cities in the U.S.
I drove home to grab a bite to eat, then crashed into bed. The next morning, I arose early, only to spy Donna’s two lambs wandering through her front yard, heading toward the road. Yup, the gate to the pasture was wide open, probably an oversight from the windmill repairman.
  (Photo by Mary Swander)
I shooed the lambs back into the pasture, and tried to close the gate, but the latch didn’t close securely. I found an old piece of wire and made a temporary repair. Then I saw that the gate didn’t fit against the adjoining pole. There was a gap wide enough for the lambs to wiggle through. I threaded a bungee cord through the gate and wrapped it around the pole, pulling it tight.
“There,” I thought. “That’s a bit of a girl fix, but it should hold until I can get help with this gate.”
A couple of hours later, the lambs were out again. This time, I watched them step right through Donna’s wooden gates. In the past, Donna had kept horses, and the wooden gates with their wide slats had always been enough to keep those animals contained. But after her divorce from Stu and the death of her favorite gelding, Donna decided to concentrate on more manageable critters.
But once again, the lambs, and Donna’s three high-stepping geese, went right through the wooden gates. This time, it took me a good couple of days to get the sheep and geese back where they belonged. The geese turned into versions of Daffy Duck, laughing at the barnyard dance. No handful of grain or hay would lure them. Off and on, for 48 hours, we do-si-doed, until the animals finally gave up.
Ding!
A text from Donna’s daughter-in-law.
We assume all is well and
you are taking care of the
animals.
I replied that I could use a little help with the gates out here. No help arrived. I covered the gates with some old pieces of cattle panel and more bungee cords.
Ding!
Can’t you just put
the lambs in with yours?
I explained that I could bring Donna’s lambs to my place and blend them in with mine, but then I would have to mow Donna’s hilly 2-acre pasture.
Ding!
Why don’t you just
put Donna’s lambs
in her barn?
I could do that if I could get them to go in there. And it’s so hot … It would be best if we could just fix the gates properly. Then I would be happy to care for them until I could take them to slaughter in the fall.
Ding!
Slaughter??????
Oh, no, I thought, the city mice are vegetarians. These lambs aren’t pets, I explained. They are livestock.
Ding!
We are contacting
the Humane Society
to take the lambs.
Good grief, I said. That isn’t necessary.
I called my handywoman and got on her list. A month later, she arrived, and we worked for a whole day together, fixing the gates and latches with new screws, with hardware cloth and cattle panels.
Later that day, I visited Donna in the rehab unit and told her that everything was fine, don’t worry about the animals or the house. We had been good neighbors long enough that we knew how to support one another.
“I can’t thank you enough,” Donna said.
She paused then turned to me. “And why don’t you see if you can bring my lambs with yours to slaughter in the fall.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/ct-state-worker-overtime-payroll/,"Connecticut spent a record $316 million in overtime last fiscal year, but overall spending, adjusted for inflation, is down from 2011.","Connecticut state government continues to struggle with a payroll quandary.
Overtime spending has continued to rise, hitting a new record in the fiscal year that closed June 30 and frustrating business leaders who see it as an unstable weakness in government finances.
But spending on overall compensation — including base wages and bonuses as well as overtime — has declined over the last decade-and-a-half once adjusted for inflation, as Connecticut has been slow to refill the thousands of public-sector jobs it shed during the 2010s.
According to Comptroller Sean Scanlon’s OpenPayroll website, the state’s total compensation bill was $5.8 billion in 2024. In 2011, it was just shy of $4.4 billion, which, after adjusting for inflation, represented $6.1 billion.
Overtime has become increasingly controversial in recent years. State employee unions argue that agencies are dangerously understaffed and much of that overtime is mandatory, exhausting staff and weakening morale. But business leaders and other critics note that overtime earnings are included in worker pension calculations.
“It’s a double jeopardy — taxpayers pay now and then get hit again when soaring overtime costs drive up overall state employee retirement liabilities,” Connecticut Business and Industry Association President Chris DePentima wrote in a recent post on the association’s website.
DePentima was referring to a report from the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis that found state government spent $316.3 million in overtime in the 2024-25 fiscal year, up $15 million or 5% from the prior 12 months.
The CBIA noted that’s also up $11 million from the record-high $305.4 million in overtime spending set just two years ago.
Business leaders have long cautioned against the huge pension debt Connecticut amassed over more than seven decades prior to 2011 by not saving properly for benefits pledged to state workers and to municipal teachers.
Connecticut entered last fiscal year with $35 billion in unfunded pension obligations. Coupled with another $44 billion the state either owes to its retiree health care program or carries in bonded debt, the $79 billion total makes Connecticut one of the most indebted states, per capita, in the nation.
When pension debt is high, the state must devote more of its annual budget to cover that expense. The minimum annual contributions Connecticut must make to its pensions already top $3.4 billion, more than 14% of the General Fund.
“We’ve got an affordability crisis in Connecticut — particularly with energy, housing, and child care — and that’s not going to get resolved if policymakers don’t curb state spending,” DePentima said.
Minority Republican legislators introduced a bill spring to remove overtime earnings from pension calculations, but it was killed by the Democratic-controlled Labor and Public Employees Committee. 
State officials have been working since 2017 to whittle down pension debt, employing aggressive savings measures that critics say harm core programs like education, health care and municipal aid.
Since 2020, Connecticut has deposited more than $8.5 billion from budget surpluses into its pension funds. And though a final audit of 2024-25 finances won’t be completed until late September, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration estimates that surplus will be almost $2.6 billion, which is the second-largest in state history. Most of that cushion also is expected to go into the pension funds.
Does CT government face a staffing crisis?
State employee unions, and much of the legislature’s Democratic majority, say pension debt is far from Connecticut’s only concern.
During Gov. Dannel P. Malloy’s tenure, which ran from 2011 through 2018, he and lawmakers used attrition and hiring freezes to mitigate several deficits, ultimately shrinking the Executive Branch workforce by 10%.
Lamont, who took office in 2019, has refilled some of those vacant posts and negotiated pay hikes of about 4.5% per year between 2021 and 2025 to help attract and retain staff.
But unions were pressed to grant wage and benefit concessions in 2011 and 2017, which have made staff retention more challenging.
More than 4,400 veteran state workers retired in the first six months of 2022, leaving before more stringent limits on pension benefits took effect. 
That event became known as the “silver tsunami.” The state typically has about 2,000 to 2,500 retirements in a full year.
The 44,542 positions authorized in last fiscal year’s state budget across all agencies is still down 16% from the 51,509 authorized in 2011.
Labor advocates note the bulk of overtime earned in recent years has been in those agencies with the worst staffing problems, particularly within the prison system.
The Department of Correction accounted for $118.8 million or 38% of overtime spending recorded last fiscal year by the state’s chief human resources database, which does not include the University of Connecticut. Correction had paid $107.3 million in overtime in the prior fiscal year.
Bianca Stedman, a correction department nurse and member of SEIU 1199NE, the state’s largest health care workers’ union, said “severe understaffing” is making it increasingly difficult to get inmates care in a timely manner.
“Instead, we are struggling to deal with the ever-growing inmate population as our workforce just continues to shrink,” she said. “We are constantly overworked, overwhelmed and exhausted. Staff at DOC, not just health care, but across the board, are leaving in droves. Retention and recruitment are at all-time lows.”
Most of the remaining overtime from 2024-25 was paid out by four other departments:

Mental Health and Addiction Services, $62.9 million.


Emergency Services and Public Protection, $46.3 million.


Developmental Services, $42.6 million.


Children and Families, $30.3 million.

Though Connecticut spends more per capita on pension benefits than most other states do, about three-quarters of that involves covering payments past generations of taxpayers failed to make. In other words, most pension spending has little to do with funding the eventual retirement benefits for present-day workers.
In addition, the gradual downsizing of the state’s workforce has greatly controlled overall compensation spending, which involves base salaries and bonuses as well as overtime.
“Something needs to change,” Stedman added.  “Unfortunately. the hiring freezes, threats to our pension and constant denial of necessary positions for our facilities … are not the way to address the issue.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_057-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168

Having a loved one in prison or jail is estimated to cost families across the United States nearly $350 billion each year, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)U.S. families lose nearly $350 billion each year due to the incarceration of a loved one in jail or prison, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.
The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.
The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.
Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

Those plans ignited significant controversy earlier this summer when the Army Corps released an initial proposal to expand its use of herbicides at a dozen sites along the lower portion of the river.
While those plans were in fact part of a years-long effort to study the effectiveness of using herbicides to control hydrilla, they quickly became the subject of viral social media posts laden with inaccuracies and conspiracy theories about the government’s intentions. In particular, many of those posts focused one chemical included in Army Corps’ plans — diquat dibromide.
In an attempt to clear the air, officials extended the public comment period for the project until August and held both in-person and virtual events to answer questions from the press and the public.
On Wednesday, the Army Corps held an online meeting to announce an update to its plans.
Beginning on Aug. 19, officials said, they plan to apply herbicide treatments to Selden Cove in Lyme and the Chester Boat Basin. Only the Chester location will receive treatments of diquat combined with another herbicide, endothall, according to the Corps’ plans. Selden Cove will be treated with only endothall.
Both treatments are scheduled to last two days, concluding on Aug 20. If weather or field conditions prevent the project from moving forward on those days, alternative dates are available the following week. (One alternate location, Middletown’s Pameacha Pond, was also included in the Corps’ schedule.)
The decision to pare the number of treatment sites down from 12 to two was due to a lapse in federal funding available for the project, according to Keith Hannon, the project manager for the Army Corps’ New England District. Last year, the project received $5 million in funding from Congress.
In addition to the two sites selected for herbicide treatments, Hannon said officials also plan to continue a related series of hydrological studies using colorful dyes at a handful of spots along the river, including a new location in Agawam, Mass.
“We are limited in what we’re able to do this year,” Hannon said. “The dye studies do have a cost, but they’re cheaper, so we’re able to do those, and those will directly inform the study and future riverside applications.”
Those dye studies date back to 2023, when research scientists working with the Army Corps began using dyes to study the flow of water in areas afflicted by hydrilla to determine which herbicides to use in specific concentrations to avoid harming other native species of wildlife. Based on those results, the Army Corps first started applying herbicides, including diquat, at five areas along the river last summer.
In follow-up sampling at those locations, researchers recorded large declines in the amount of hydrilla, with minimal impacts to native plants, according to results shared at Wednesday’s meeting. This summer, however, the hydrilla has returned in Chester Boat Basin and, to a larger extent, in Selden Cove.
Among the concerns raised by members of the public at Wednesday’s meeting was the potential impact on swimmers at a children’s summer camp at Hamburg Cove, down river from the two treatment areas.
Anne Overstreet, the director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s  Pesticide Re-Evaluation Division, said the agency did not find any information to justify those concerns during its most recent review of diquat in 2020.
“The bottom line is, if the labeled directions are being followed, there are no concerns from people swimming or coming into contact with water that’s been treated with diquat,” Overstreet said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5345047.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

Ro Khanna of California visited Jackson to highlight a technology job training initiative with Jackson State University he’s spearheading as part of a larger effort to connect the tech sector to historically Black colleges and universities.
Khanna, a Democrat, represents Silicon Valley, home to Google, Nvidia, and Apple. His Thursday visit is part of the congressman’s broader effort to connect Black communities, particularly in the Deep South, with the uber-wealthy companies in his home district.  
“We need a generation of people who are participating in the modern digital economy that are being trained and educated right here in Jackson,” Khanna said at the Smith Robertson Museum in downtown Jackson.
The program gives $5,000 scholarships to students at Jackson State University and allows them to participate in an 18-month course, according to Khanna. After completing the program, the graduates are usually offered a lucrative job in the technology sector, with a starting salary ranging from $65,000 to $80,000. 
“You have to bring the digital revolution to the Black South,” Khanna said. 
The son of Indian immigrants, Khanna and his family have a deep appreciation for the Civil Rights movement and the Mississippi organizers at its epicenter. 
The California lawmaker said his grandfather was jailed in India for four years for his support of Mahatma Gandhi’s movement for independence from the British Empire. That same movement in India inspired the nonviolent organizing tactics utilized by Civil Rights leaders such as Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis. 
“The Civil Rights movement then led to the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, and that’s what led my parents to come to the United States,” Khanna said. 
Despite its rich civil rights history and status as the Blackest state in the nation, Mississippi is sometimes overlooked by the national Democratic Party because of the state’s overall conservative electorate. 
Khanna told Mississippi Today in an interview that the national Democratic Party should invest more in Mississippi. If it supports organizing efforts, he said, the Magnolia State could become competitive in statewide elections. 
Beyond politics, the lawmaker said the party and nation did not support the capital city enough during the Jackson Water crisis that left thousands of residents without clean running water and has not put Mississippi at the front and center of economic development. 
“Anyone who wants to understand the history of segregation, the history of racial justice, has to understand Mississippi,” Khanna said. “And anyone who wants to see the hope and promise of economic development has to come here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/07140810/IMG_7163.jpg,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-08 15:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Renters displaced by UConn apartment purchase demand changes,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/stamford-uconn-apartments/,Displacement from may force renters to move into an apartment that makes them ineligible for a middle-income housing program.,"Stamford resident Brittany Lawrence moved into her home at The BLVD Apartments in downtown Stamford nine years ago. It was Lawrence’s first apartment after college.
Now, Lawrence is planning her next move as The BLVD Apartments on Washington Boulevard are in the process of being sold to the University of Connecticut. The building will be converted into dormitories for UConn Stamford.
Lawrence first received notice of the building’s sale and plans for tenant relocation from an email and notice on her door in February.
“I’m in an affordable unit, and those leases are renewable by recertification,” Lawrence said. “So if you’re not going to renew after my current term, what happens? And that was my question, basically.”
Lawrence is a member of the city-run affordable housing program, Below Market Rate (BMR), which is geared toward renters earning 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI). At BLVD there are nine affordable apartments.
Displacement may force renters to move into an apartment that makes them ineligible for the middle-income program, and city officials have been unhelpful, Lawrence said.
“‘Sorry’ is not going to keep people housed. ‘Sorry’ is not going to help the families that you claim to want to help,” Lawrence said. “All in all, it’s a state of vulnerableness that you know is a problem because you market it to the vulnerable population.”
Lawrence fears she and other residents at the BLVD apartments will now take whatever apartment they can get.
“When you have people that have nothing, whose hopes and dreams rely on you saying ‘This is what we can do for you,’ or ‘This is what we can offer you,’ you put them in a state of desperation that they’re not able to think through what those long term implications can be,” Lawrence said.
What Stamford’s BMR program means
Residents partnered with the Connecticut Tenants Union (CTTU) are advocating for reforms to the city’s Below Market Rate program.
In Stamford, the BMR program is tied to the affordable apartments, not the tenants, according to CTTU Vice President Luke Melonakos-Harrison. Unlike traditional voucher-based programs like Section 8 or Rental Assistance Program, once the tenants are moved out, they have to start over and reapply for the BMR program.
“People are clinging to these units for dear life. What these tenants are pushing for is recognition that once you’re in the BMR program, for that to mean something,” Melonakos-Harrison said. “If you get displaced by something like this, they’re leasing it to UConn, now all of those apartments are lost.”
Union members outlined five key requests for the city, including a freezing of the annual eligibility certification to protect tenants from disqualification due to income changes, household shifts, or evolving city policies caused by their involuntary displacement.
Tenants asked Stamford officials to give low-income renters from BLVD priority for new affordable apartments, and keep the BMR status dependent on the tenant rather than the apartment.
“Those tenants should be recognized as having a special status because they were in this program,” Melonakos-Harrison said.
The current co-owners, RMS Companies and the Wolff Company, informed tenants they need to move out of BLVD by April 2026, Melonakos-Harrison said. Neither RMS nor Wolff responded to Connecticut Public’s request for comment.
The tentative plan was for BMR renters to move into market rate housing, with RMS/Wolff paying the rent difference until the completion of the company’s next Stamford venture; the renovation of a former Burlington store into nearly 300 apartments.
UConn Stamford’s Chief Administrative Officer Jennifer Orlikoff said she’s impressed with RMS and Wolff’s effort to smooth over the transition for residents.
“They are going out of their way to pay for relocation costs, especially for the tenants who are below market rate,” Orlikoff said. “They are providing interim housing for them as well and just and I think, general guidance for folks who are looking for other places to live in town.”
By late August, about 100 UConn students will be moved into the BLVD building. The newly-converted apartments were part of the general flow of apartment vacancies, not the result of forced displacement, Orlikoff said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0216-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-08 15:56:32.358627

After years of protesting his innocence of murder charges and failing to convince any court, Pointer cut a deal to trade his life without parole sentence for a 23-year term on two counts of second degree murder […]","Deandre Pointer, a man incarcerated at the Jefferson City Correctional Center, discusses his legal effort to get his parole date recalculated. If the date is not changed, Pointer will serve 40 years on a 23-year sentence (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).When Deandre Pointer appeared in front of a Jackson County judge in June 2023, his world was bright.
After years of protesting his innocence of murder charges and failing to convince any court, Pointer cut a deal to trade his life without parole sentence for a 23-year term on two counts of second degree murder and two counts of armed criminal action.
He had been in custody for 21 years and thought the deal would mean he’d served enough time to be released in 2024. 
“The only reason why I took this plea was that my father was sick,” Pointer said in an interview with The Independent at the Jefferson City Correctional Center.
But when a Missouri Department of Corrections record clerk finished processing his paperwork, Pointer’s world turned dark.
Instead of being given almost 7,000 days of credit for time served on all four charges, Pointer was allowed credit only for 557 days jail time before his 2005 trial on three of the four counts. 
He is not eligible for release until 2044.
As a result, he is back in court seeking a ruling that the records clerk made an error. For himself, and others who feel they have been short-changed on their time-served credits, the outcome of those cases will determine if they go home or stay in prison.
Over almost 20 years in state prison, Pointer, 52, maintained hope he would find a way out. He worked in the license plate factory, paid his attorney out of the 80 cents an hour he earned, maintained contact with his family and became an ordained minister.
“I never took anxiety meds,” Pointer said in an interview with The Independent. “Never in my life. Now, you know, I have to take anxiety meds just to have a functional day.”

On Monday: A working group created by Missouri’s governor seeks to address myriad issues with the state’s parole process.

Pointer’s situation is tied to how parole dates are initially calculated, something that happens within 90 days of a person arriving to serve their sentence. Other people in custody complain that the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole’s new interpretation of parole policies that state how much time must be served for one particular charge — armed criminal action — pushed their possible release date back, in some cases a decade or more.
Advocates say there could be hundreds of others across the 19 adult prisons who thought they’d served enough time to be eligible for parole but were suddenly and unexpectedly years away from being released. 
Kent Gipson, an attorney from Kansas City who represents Pointer in his court battles, has handled several cases challenging the reinterpretation of how much time must be served for an armed criminal action charge.
“You get your sentence reduced, and then they recalculate it and say that you have to do more time than you did before you got your sentence reduced,” Gipson said. “This can’t be right.”
Gipson called the Board of Probation and Parole’s change to armed criminal action sentences “egregious,” because “those guys actually had parole hearings scheduled, and they took them away from and said, ‘Sorry, we’re moving it back 15 years because we’re changing this rule.’”
The board was using its authority and did not change how much of a life sentence must be served, even if those charged with armed criminal action think it was changed, Steven Mueller, operations manager for the board, wrote in an email.
“There is no maximum release date on any life sentence and release is at the discretion of the board,” he wrote.
For several months now, Pointer has been waiting for a court ruling in two cases challenging the calculation. Meanwhile, prisoner advocates are hopeful a working group empaneled by Gov. Mike Kehoe will address the issue. 
Kehoe directed the group to bring “clarity, transparency and accountability” to the parole process.
Parole policy or rule changes that would extend the time to be served for particular crimes or sentences should be forward-looking, applying only to new convictions, Clifton Davis of the Missouri Justice Coalition, a group that advocates for better treatment of incarcerated people, testified at the working group’s June 13 public hearing.
“While (armed criminal action) carries a minimum, internal practices often add years that were not imposed by the sentencing court,” Davis said. “We ask that this working group ensure that the board’s decision reflects legislative sentencing intent, not internal enhancements.”
 The calculation

 The Jefferson City Correctional Center (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Under the Missouri criminal code, second-degree murder since 1994 has been considered a dangerous felony, with a requirement that the offender serve at least 85% of their sentence before being considered for release. 
For a 23-year sentence like Pointer’s, that is a little more than 19 and one-half years.
When Pointer pleaded guilty and was resentenced, he had been held for 6,929 days, or 18.9 years.
In the calculation Pointer received on his return to prison, he found he was being required to serve 18 of the 23 years, or until 2039, on the armed criminal action charges. That was done based on the 2019 parole regulation revisions. 
But that isn’t his release date, just the date that he will finish those charges. The second-degree murder conviction carries a requirement that he serve 85% of the 23-year sentence, with a release date in 2044.
The change impacted anyone who had a parole hearing on an armed criminal action conviction scheduled after Sept. 1, 2019, moving their hearing date a decade or more into the future. Those who received a hearing, and a release date, before the revisions were issued went home.  
Advocates are uncertain how many other incarcerated people are serving sentences that extend beyond the time they were told to expect parole when they arrived in prison. 
 Pointer’s charges

On June 12, 2003, Pointer was at his rented home in Kansas City when Eddie Hall, who he was allowing to stay with him, arrived with a woman named Angela Ray.
After they smoked crack cocaine, according to court records, Hall pulled a gun, forced Ray to have sex, then bound and strangled her. Hall disposed of Ray’s body with Pointer’s help, prosecutors claimed in court documents, by loading her into the trunk of her rented car, driving to an undeveloped area and setting it on fire. 
Five days later, Hall and Pointer were home when Bobby Roby, a cousin of Pointer, and another woman arrived in the evening. Near midnight, according to the statement Pointer made to police, Hall again pulled a gun, tied Pointer to a chair with speaker wire, bound Roby with duct tape to a basement support pole and raped the woman. 
Hall then strangled Roby to death and forced the woman to go with him to dump the body in a pond by threatening to kill her children. They then returned to Pointer’s home, where he had been tied to a chair.
About 12 hours later, Pointer went to a police division station and reported both murders. When police returned to his home, they arrested Hall and freed the woman.
The initial court filing on Hall names Pointer as a victim. In an interview with The Independent, he said he didn’t go to police immediately after Ray’s death because of fear of violence from Hall or his friends. 
Ray was killed, Pointer claims, because she had testified against one of Hall’s friends.
A year later, the woman involved changed her story and accused Pointer of participating in her rape and the choking death of Roby. 
Pointer was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. 
The charges were later amended to add second-degree murder for the death of Ray.
After his October 2005 trial, Pointer said, prosecutors offered him a deal of 18 to 20 years in prison if he would testify against Hall. But Pointer says he was forced at gunpoint to help dispose of Ray’s body, and was tied to a chair during Roby’s murder. So he believed he was innocent and was unwilling to admit to committing a crime.
“I told (the prosecutor) I would testify, but I do not want to take the plea for something I did not do,” Pointer said. “I testified, but I didn’t take the plea, because I wanted to keep my appeals open.”
Pointer was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to life in prison without parole on the first-degree murder charge and life in prison on second-degree murder and the two counts of armed criminal action. The terms were to be served consecutively.
Hall was convicted of a single count of first degree murder in December 2005 and is now serving life without parole.
 Conviction reversed

One of the most common ways to challenge a sentence or conviction, in addition to a direct appeal, is called post-conviction relief.
Defendants who plead guilty lose their direct appeal rights. A person in prison can have the conviction or sentence set aside by successfully showing the constitution has been violated, or an attorney has failed in some manner.
After his direct appeals were exhausted, that’s what Pointer did in October 2007. A public defender was appointed to represent him. But in February 2008, after finding that Pointer filed a document too late, the judge rescinded the appointment and dismissed the case.
In 2022 Gipson succeeded in reopening Pointer’s post-conviction relief case on the grounds that he had been abandoned by his public defender in 2008. That’s when negotiations began with the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney’s office ultimately leading to the original conviction being set aside so Pointer could plead guilty to two counts of second degree murder and two of armed criminal action.
At the June 1, 2023, resentencing, Gipson conceded prosecutors had enough evidence to convict Pointer of the restated charges. And before he was formally resentenced, Burnett took testimony from Myesha Robertson, the daughter of Bobby Roby, and Ruthie Kidd, the mother of Angela Ray.
They, too, thought Pointer would be released soon.
“It definitely infuriates me that after 20 years I stand here or sit here today only because you are remorseful for the position you put yourself in,” Robertson said.
She saw no justice in the resentencing, she said.
“Your actions have caused an indefinite void in my life,” she said.
Kidd said she believed in capital punishment and that Pointer should not be released.
“I feel it’s most unfortunate that I work every day, and my and others taxes go to feed this man, clothe him, house him, cool him, exercise him, at our expense,” Kidd said. “He’s taken something from us that we can…that he can’t give back, that we can never get back.”
 Other cases

 Steven Tyler Decker, third from left, is incarcerated at the Jefferson City Correctional Center, where he feels his remaining time before parole has been miscalculated. He is shown in a family photo with, from left, Blake Decker, a brother, Fabian Camacho, an uncle, and his son Ryan (Submitted photo).
Steven Tyler Decker, like Pointer, feels he is being shortchanged on jail time credit.
In March 2021, Decker was charged with first-degree murder for a killing that occurred at a Kansas City motel. After charges were reduced to second degree murder, he was allowed to post a $50,000 bond while he waited for trial.
Before he could be tried, however, he was arrested on drug and weapons charges. The judge in that case ordered he be held without bond, but the bond in his earlier case was never revoked.
That, he said in a telephone interview from the Jefferson City Correctional Center, is the source of his complaint about how his parole date has been calculated.
”I should have been eligible for parole now,” Decker said.
He pleaded guilty in the drug case on Aug. 18, 2023, and was sentenced to five years on each of two drug counts and four years on unlawful use of a weapon, all to be served concurrently.
Then he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to seven years, to be served concurrently with his other conviction.
Under state parole regulations, Decker has 523 days of jail-time credit. When he was sentenced, the judge ordered Decker be given credit for time served from March 16, 2022, to June 13, 2025. But that came with a caveat — if the Department of Corrections didn’t allow it, Decker couldn’t file an appeal on that basis.
With 1,185 days in custody, Decker thought the guilty plea would position him for release. But the department did not allow the time he was in jail on the drug charges or the time he was held by the state on the manslaughter sentence.
“They never revoked my bond, so technically, I was still out on bond on the murder case” until the April guilty plea, Decker said.
Decker is eligible for parole in 2028. His security level was recently reduced and he’s seeking transfer to another prison.
On Aug. 1, 2019, James Dunn received notice his parole hearing would be held in two months. He had been in custody since 1996, when he was arrested and charged with second degree murder and armed criminal action. He was given consecutive life sentences. 
At the time of his scheduled parole hearing, Dunn had completed 85% of the murder conviction and was approaching the three-year statutory minimum time for the armed criminal action charge.
A month before he was to go before the parole board, the department issued its revised guidebook for parole procedures. It required anyone serving a life sentence with eligibility for parole to serve at least 15 years, or half of what the statutes define as a life sentence.
Dunn was informed his hearing date had been changed to June 2036. 
“I’d done the time that makes me eligible to be released, and they moved the goal posts at the last second,” Dunn said in a telephone interview from Jefferson City Correctional Center.
Dunn challenged the change in court but was turned down in Cole County Circuit Court then lost again in his appeal.
In the interview, Dunn said he feels he has received the punishment he was due for his crimes.
“I have two granddaughters,” he said. “I don’t want anything special. I want to see my family, spend time with my mom while she’s still around, and my granddaughters, and just live a normal life.
“I’m not looking for an extravagant life when I get out here, I just want to get out of here.”
 Fighting for release

Pointer is directly challenging his parole date calculation in Cole County, where he is being held, and in Jackson County, where he was sentenced.
In the Cole County case, Circuit Judge Brian Stumpe has been weighing his decision since April 24.
“It is simply shocking to the conscience that a state can, without consequence, require a prisoner to serve an additional 20 years beyond the maximum sentence imposed by the trial court’s judgment and sentence,” Gipson wrote in the petition in Jackson County.
The calculation is correct, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Clark argued in a filing in Cole County, “because his prior sentences were ordered to be served consecutively and he cannot receive credit for those offenses even though they were vacated and subsequently imposed concurrently.”
Hindsight provides a clarity that is not apparent as things are happening and for Pointer, the plea deal he was offered in 2005 to testify against Hall looks pretty good now.
“My oldest daughter, Monique, said, ‘Dad, I wish that you would have just taken the pleas that they offered you a long time ago.’” Pointer said. “Because if I would have taken the 20 year plea, I would have been gone, gone home, a way long time before now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Deandre-Pointer-06262025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)On Aug. 1, Cornerstone Apartment Services — the largest property management company in central Denver, with over 290 properties across the Front Range — sent out a notice that they will begin billing tenants for utilities using a variable system managed by third-party companies Zego or RealPage.
The change, effective Oct. 1, replaces flat-rate utility billing with a monthly, usage-based system determined by proprietary algorithms. While seemingly innocuous, Cornerstone’s adoption of third-party utility billing reflects a broader and more dangerous trend: the normalization of AI-driven pricing systems that use opaque algorithms to manipulate costs and extract more from tenants, supported by a governor working to advance AI technology.

Many Coloradans might recognize the name RealPage, the Texas-based software company currently at the center of an ongoing antitrust investigation and multi-state lawsuit, which includes Colorado, that highlights how algorithmic price fixing enables corporate landlords to share proprietary rental data and coordinate rent increases, effectively suppressing competition and driving prices up in cities across the U.S. These systems obscure how prices are set and shift financial risk onto working people.
The Colorado Legislature has also made its own attempt to push back on AI price-fixing in the housing market. House Bill 25-1004: No Pricing Coordination Between Landlords, the second attempt of its kind following a similar bill was killed in the 2024 legislative session, looked to restrict the sale, distribution and use of algorithmic pricing tools in rental housing as a direct response to the growing body of evidence that software like RealPage’s is driving up housing costs through covert collusion.
However, in May, Gov. Jared Polis vetoed the bill.
Instead of siding with tenants and affordable housing advocates, Polis’ veto sent a clear message: He is more interested in protecting the interests of tech giants and property monopolies than defending Coloradans from predatory pricing schemes. The veto came at a time when rent has far outpaced wage growth, evictions remain at record highs, and corporate landlords have consolidated control of a significant portion of the rental housing market.
In Colorado and across the nation, the implications of AI overreach extend far beyond housing. Polis is reconvening the Legislature for a special session to address the state’s severe budget shortfall. But the agenda also includes efforts to weaken or eliminate emerging AI regulations put into place by Senate Bill 24-205: Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence, scheduled to go into effect Feb. 1. This will mark a profound misalignment of priorities between state legislators and the executive branch at a time when tens of thousands of Coloradans are losing access to essential services.
Drastic cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, child care assistance, and other safety net programs in the recently signed “One Big Beautiful Bill” have left many working families across Colorado reeling. Coupled with Colorado’s own budget shortfalls, a special session should be laser-focused on stabilizing public services and correcting the state’s dire budget trajectory.
In a time of volatile federal preemptions and deepening budget constraints, the governor’s focus on deregulating AI, particularly in the housing sectors, is yet another troubling example of his alignment with corporate interests over the needs of Coloradans. Rather than enabling an industry that threatens affordability and consumer protections, Polis should use every opportunity, beginning with the special session, to fight for the well-being of the very people he was elected to serve.

“They could barely breathe because there’s no opening like a bus — it's like a closed box,” a Canadian police spokesperson said.

Forty-four asylum-seekers, most from Haiti, were found packed in the back of a 16-foot U-Haul truck in southern Québec early Sunday, according to Canadian authorities.
Canadian police also arrested three people on smuggling charges.
Cpl. Erique Gasse, a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, estimated the asylum-seekers walked a few miles in the United States to cross the border before getting into the truck in Canada.
Working off a tip, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Sûreté du Québec intercepted the box truck just south of Stanstead, Québec, minutes north of the Vermont border station at Derby Line, Sunday at 2:20 a.m.
The truck was carrying 44 foreign nationals — including a 4-year-old child and a pregnant woman — packed in dangerously hot and cramped conditions in a suspected case of human trafficking, according to Gasse.
“They could barely breathe because there’s no opening like a bus — it’s like a closed box. So they were pretty relieved to see the police opening the door but at the same time, obviously, they got caught,” he said.
Many of the smuggled migrants were wet and told officers they had to walk for about two hours in the forest and had to wade through waist-high water before they got into the truck on the Canadian side. The weather was getting cold and Gasse said officers provided blankets and shared water and food with the asylum seekers. 
“They were hungry. They were thirsty, and they needed some energy,” he said.
It was an unusually large number of people by the Canadian police’s standards, he said, as they usually apprehend families or small groups of people trying to cross the border. 
“We see that a lot in Europe,” he said. “I hope it’s not a new trend.”
The 47 people were arrested and brought to the Canada Border Services Agency at the Stanstead Highway 55 border crossing, according to Guillaume Bérubé, a spokesperson for the agency. 
Ogulcan Mersin, 25, Dogan Alakus, 31, and Firat Yuksek, 31, were arrested on charges of aiding and abetting to commit an immigration offense as well as a charge of assisting people to enter Canada outside of a designated customs office.
They are detained in Sherbrooke until their next court hearing on Aug. 28, for a bail hearing, according to Alessia Bongiovanni from the Public Prosecution Service of Canada.
“The investigation is ongoing and additional charges may be laid. The (Canada Border Services Agency) cannot comment further as the matter is before the courts,” Bérubé wrote in an email Wednesday. 
Most of the asylum-seekers were taken to the agency’s refugee processing center in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle and are set to be subject to individual immigration assessments, he wrote.
Canadian news outlets, such as the CBC, have reported that many of them were sent back to the U.S.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch’s office is aware of the incident and is working with the delegation and partners involved, said Elisabeth St. Onge, Welch’s press secretary.
Welch has condemned the Trump administration’s decision to reverse the temporary protected status and a humanitarian parole program that allows people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to legally enter and stay in the U.S. for two years.
The reversal of temporary protected status for people from Haiti endangers the safety and well-being of refugees and asylum-seekers seeking a better life, St. Onge said.
Temporary protected status is based on the circumstances in the country and Haiti has long been facing a severe humanitarian crisis involving gang violence, food insecurity and a collapsing health care system.
The situation in Haiti is actually worse this month, according to Yvonne Lodico, founder and executive director of the Grace Initiative Global, a nonprofit that provides services to several refugee groups living in Vermont, including Haitians.
Almost 1.3 million people are displaced in Haiti, which some say has the highest homicide rate in the world, according to the Human Rights Watch report Lodico cited. Violence continues to escalate, and more than 5,600 people were killed there in 2024.
“The Haitians love Vermont. It is welcoming, peaceful, and they have all been able to work and become economically self-sufficient,” she said. “However, the situation is frightening, and the prospect of being sent to a detention center provides compelling reasons for individuals to seek help and a chance to survive. So it seems that Canada, even though there is no guarantee that they will be able to stay, is worth the effort.”
Canada looks to tighten border control
The Canada Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police work with partners “to disrupt human smuggling networks and to combat international criminal organizations that seek to profit from the desperation and vulnerability of others,” Bérubé wrote in the email.
So far this year, the agency has processed 14,874 asylum applications as of July 27 in Québec, a dip from the same period last year when it processed 22,337 asylum applications, according to data shared by Bérubé.
“People who attempt to enter Canada illegally by smuggling across the border can easily find themselves in vulnerable risky situations and may be exposed to extreme climatic and environmental conditions … leading to malnutrition or serious injury,” Bérubé wrote. 
Those who enter Canada in violation of immigration laws illegally could face criminal charges, court-imposed fines, jail terms and deportation, he said.
Meanwhile, similar to the Trump administration’s continued crackdown on immigration in the U.S., Mark Carney, Canada’s newly elected Liberal prime minister, has proposed the Strong Borders Act. 
It outlines sweeping changes to prevent refugee crossings, the BBC reported, and has been criticized by advocates and Canada’s left-leaning New Democratic Party and advocates.
President Donald Trump has long made claims about undocumented migrants and drugs moving across the U.S.-Canada border. He recently increased tariffs on Canadian imports, citing the country’s alleged failure to curb fentanyl smuggling into the U.S. But many imports will avoid the increase thanks to an existing treaty, the BBC reported.

The post Healey signs bill expanding reproductive, transgender care protections appeare[...]","SURROUNDED BY HEALTH CARE advocates and curious tourists peering into Nurses Hall, Gov. Maura Healey signed an expanded shield law Thursday giving patients and providers in Massachusetts a new layer of defense against out-of-state intrusion into reproductive and transgender care.
“No one is going to come to Massachusetts and attack our people, attack our institutions, attack our providers because we believe in freedom,” Healey said. “It’s why we’ve continued, collectively, to take action, and we will continue to take action as necessary. We owe it to the people of Massachusetts. And you know what? We owe it to Americans. We owe it to this country.”
Attendees at the bill-signing ceremony represented Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, Reproductive Equity Now, ACLU Massachusetts, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, Fenway Health, Health Imperatives, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Massachusetts Medical Society, among others. 
At a time of enhanced federal scrutiny and legal threats largely led by Republicans in other states, lawmakers last week moved to update the 2022 shield law intended to protect providers and patients of reproductive care, including abortions, and transgender care. Supporters say additional steps are needed to plug gaps in existing law in the wake of the US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
The expanded shield law limits the release of sensitive data, allows prescription labels to display a practice name instead of an individual physician’s name, and codifies a state requirement for abortion care to be provided in emergencies when medically necessary. The anonymity provision for prescription labels is linked to the case of a doctor in New York — which has a shield law — who’s faced a felony charge in Louisiana and a hefty penalty in Texas for providing abortion medication.
The law also blocks courts here from considering or admitting cases of abuse, neglect or maltreatment for parents who support their children in receiving transgender care.
“It’s a true honor today to celebrate a law that will save lives, including my own, and so many other trans people who I know,” said Dallas Ducar, who’s transgender and is Fenway Health’s executive vice president of donor engagement and external relations. “This will save families, will protect families, and remind our country what leadership looks like.”
In a statement to the News Service, the Massachusetts Family Institute warned about the law’s impact on children.
“Governor Healey and Massachusetts legislators have sadly, but predictably, bowed to ideology instead of protecting Massachusetts citizens, especially children,” MFI general counsel Sam Whiting said. “This ‘shield law’ only shields activist healthcare providers from transparency and accountability, all while infringing on the rights of other states to protect children from abortion and irreversible gender mutilation procedures.”
Healey called the law a “necessary step forward,” as she invoked the gravity of the week, which brought Texas Democratic lawmakers to Beacon Hill twice to amplify their resistance to  efforts in their state to redraw congressional districts to favor Republicans. Similar to how those Texas Democrats say they are fighting to protect voting rights nationwide, Healey signaled Massachusetts Democrats are taking a similar approach to “reproductive rights.”
“What we do to protect people’s rights here in Massachusetts impacts the country,” Healey said. 
House Judiciary Committee Chair Michael Day said last week that the urgency of the effort to update the shield law “has been dictated by the wild rhetoric as well as the acts taken by both this presidential administration, as well as several of our sister states, in the field that this bill covers: the right for a woman to control her body and the right for transgender individuals to be treated as equals here in the commonwealth.”
In New Hampshire last week, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed two bills banning transgender care for minors, including puberty blockers or hormone treatments, as well as chest surgeries, according to NHPR.
“Medical decisions made at a young age can carry lifelong consequences, and these bills represent a balanced, bipartisan effort to protect children,” Ayotte said in a statement.

About 40 percent of transgender youth across the country — or roughly 120,400 individuals — live in 27 states that have bans on gender identity care, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
Georgia’s six-week abortion made national headlines this summer, after a pregnant woman who had been declared brain-dead was kept on life support for months until her baby was delivered via an emergency C-section.
In Missouri, a trial is slated for later this month surrounding the certification of a 2026 ballot initiative, based on a measure state lawmakers approved, to largely ban abortions with some exceptions, KOMU 8 reported. Just last November, Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect abortion access, after the state outlawed the procedure following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling, according to PBS News.
Forty-one states have some form of abortion bans, including 12 with total bans and 28 with bans based on gestational duration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on reproductive health care. Twenty-two states and Washington, DC also have shield protections for reproductive and transgender care.
Sen. Cindy Friedman, the Senate’s point person on the original and expanded shield law, said the measure is “fundamentally about protecting our state from those outside who wish to decide how we in Massachusetts choose to deliver health care and the values we decide should drive that care.”
“We sit down together and decide what our values are — not Texas, not Missouri, not the federal government,” Friedman said. “It’s us here in Massachusetts. States across the nation have continued actually to look to us to see what we’re doing to provide these vital protections.”
Massachusetts Medical Society President Dr. Olivia Liao released a statement supporting the new law.
“The law provides critical protections for patients seeking and physicians delivering reproductive and gender-affirming care, responding to growing threats that seek to interfere with decisions that belong to patients and their doctors,” Liao said. “Out-of-state legal actions seeking to criminalize care that is grounded in science, medical standards, and ethical practice have no place in the Commonwealth.”

In 2023, it had the lowest.","Connecticut has traditionally been among the states with the most reported Lyme disease cases, despite having only about 1% of the United States’ population. But in recent years, Connecticut’s case rate has not increased as quickly as in other Northeast states.
The number of cases per 100,000 Connecticut residents declined fairly steadily from 2010 through 2021. But a big increase in 2022 and 2023 was still not as large as the increase in case rates in other Northeast states. 
Connecticut’s Lyme disease rate has been below the Northeast average since 2016. In recent years, only New Jersey has had a lower rate.
The number of Lyme disease cases overall has remained somewhat steady in Connecticut compared to other Northeast states, with an average of 2,718 cases per year since 1995, according to the Department of Public Health.
The Northeast — all the New England states, along with New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania — has remained the epicenter for Lyme disease. Every year, the Northeast accounts for about 70% of the country’s cases, according to a CT Mirror analysis of CDC data.
On an average year, almost 9% of Northeast cases came from CT.
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in both Connecticut and the United States, according to the state Department of Public Health. The disease was first reported in 1975. It is caused by a bacterial infection spread through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks. Early symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, and a distinct rash. If untreated, the disease can lead to more serious complications affecting joints, the heart and the nervous system, according to the CDC.
A recent study from Dartmouth found that in the Northeast, including Connecticut, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, half of all adult blacklegged or deer ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Up to 25% of nymph-stage ticks, which are harder to detect, also carry the bacteria.
Recent tick surveillance shows that deer ticks are by far the most common species collected in the state. New London County recorded the highest density of adult and nymphal blacklegged ticks. Meanwhile, Litchfield County showed the highest rate of adult female tick infection, and Fairfield County had the highest nymph infection rate.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-3.12.56-PM-1024x733.png,,,2025-08-08 11:58:25.598168

Read this story in English.
El “gran y hermoso proyecto de ley” del presidente Donald J. Trump introducirá cambios en la forma en que algunas personas califican o siguen siendo elegibles para Medicaid o asistencia alimentaria durante los próximos dos años.
Una de esas revisiones es la implementación de nuevos requisitos laborales: más personas deberán trabajar, capacitarse o hacer voluntariado al menos 80 horas al mes para acceder a estos programas en los próximos años, aunque existen varias exenciones.
Estas normas se aplicarán a Medicaid, conocido como HUSKY en Connecticut, así como al Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria, comúnmente conocido como SNAP.
Quienes apoyan la iniciativa afirman que fomenta la participación en la fuerza laboral y garantiza que las personas no se aprovechen de los programas de la red de seguridad social. Sin embargo, los críticos argumentan que la mayoría de las personas que acceden a estos programas ya trabajan, lo que les impone un requisito adicional para demostrar que participan en la fuerza laboral o en un programa de capacitación.
Desde que la “gran y hermosa ley” se promulgó hace apenas un mes, los Estados aún están definiendo cómo se verán los cambios para los solicitantes y beneficiarios, así como para las agencias que deberán administrar y hacer cumplir las nuevas normas.
Esto es lo que sabemos hasta ahora:
¿Cuáles son los requisitos laborales? ¿Los tiene Connecticut actualmente?
Los programas de asistencia pública pueden imponer reglas para que algunos afiliados puedan acceder y mantener los beneficios. Dicho requisito no significa necesariamente que una persona deba conseguir un trabajo. Por lo general, una persona puede ser voluntaria o participar en un programa de capacitación para calificar.
Connecticut y la mayoría de los Estados no tienen actualmente ningún requisito laboral para Medicaid, y será una novedad cuando la nueva ley entre en vigor en este ámbito.
Ya existe un conjunto de reglas a nivel nacional para los beneficios de SNAP: requisitos laborales generales y requisitos adicionales para adultos sin discapacidad sin dependientes.
El requisito general implica registrarse para trabajar, participar en un programa de Empleo y Capacitación del SNAP, aceptar un trabajo adecuado si se le ofrece y no abandonar voluntariamente un trabajo ni cambiar su horario a menos de 30 horas semanales sin una buena razón. Hay excepciones para las mujeres embarazadas, las personas que estudian y las personas que cuidan a niños pequeños.
Los adultos sanos sin dependientes de entre 18 y 54 años deben trabajar o participar en actividades comunitarias durante al menos 80 horas al mes. Si no cumple con este requisito, puede perder los beneficios del SNAP después de tres meses y podría tener que esperar el período de tres años para recibirlos nuevamente.
Para el SNAP, un dependiente se define actualmente como una persona menor de 18 años, pero esto está sujeto a cambios como parte de la nueva ley.
¿Quiénes están exentos según los requisitos laborales actuales y los nuevos?
Bajo el formato actual del SNAP, no es necesario cumplir con el requisito de trabajo para adultos sanos sin dependientes si está embarazada, tiene limitaciones físicas y mentales, vive con alguien menor de 18 años o ya está exento del requisito general de trabajo, como quienes participan en programas de tratamiento de alcoholismo y drogas, o si un inscrito estudia o participa en un programa de capacitación al menos medio tiempo.
Hay algunos grupos de adultos sanos sin dependientes que actualmente están exentos del requisito de trabajo, pero que perderán sus exenciones con la nueva ley: veteranos, personas sin hogar, adultos jóvenes que superan la edad límite de acogida y padres o tutores que viven con alguien mayor de 14 años.
Una vez que se promulguen los requisitos laborales para HUSKY, habrá casi una docena de exenciones: mujeres embarazadas o en período de posparto, jóvenes en hogares de acogida, veteranos con discapacidad, personas con trastornos por consumo de alcohol y sustancias, beneficiarios que ya cumplen con el requisito a través de otros programas federales, personas con una exención por dificultades económicas a corto plazo, personas recientemente encarceladas, padres y cuidadores de un dependiente menor de 14 años o con una discapacidad, y personas con problemas de salud.
¿Cuándo entrarán en vigor las nuevas normas? ¿Se aplicarán en mi caso?
El momento exacto y el número de personas afectadas por los requisitos laborales aún no se conocen, a menos que usted pertenezca a alguna de las categorías exentas mencionadas anteriormente.
Esta es la primera vez que Medicaid estará sujeto a requisitos laborales en la mayoría de los Estados. Entrará en vigor a principios de 2027. Sin embargo, Estados como Connecticut podrían retrasarlos dos años más, hasta 2029, si demuestran que están haciendo esfuerzos de buena fe para implementarlos.
Las nuevas reglas se aplicarán a la población de expansión de Medicaid, conocida como HUSKY D en Connecticut, que incluye cobertura para adultos de bajos ingresos sin dependientes.
Para que esta población califique para Medicaid como adulto menor de 65 años, el beneficiario deberá trabajar o participar en capacitación, educación o servicio comunitario al menos 80 horas al mes. Este criterio también se aplicará a los padres o tutores con hijos mayores de 14 años.
El Estado aún desconoce cuántas personas en Connecticut podrían ser expulsadas de Medicaid o no ser elegibles al solicitarlo debido específicamente a requisitos laborales. Sin embargo, los primeros informes sobre la “gran factura” del Departamento de Servicios Sociales de Connecticut y la oficina del contralor estatal estiman, de manera más general, que entre 100,000 y 200,000 residentes podrían perder su cobertura HUSKY en el futuro por diversas razones.
En el caso del SNAP, se ampliarán los requisitos laborales para los adultos sin discapacidad y sin dependientes, con el mismo mínimo de horas de trabajo o participación comunitaria que para quienes reciben HUSKY. No está claro cuándo entrarán en vigor las normas más estrictas, y un informe preliminar del Departamento de Servicios Sociales (DSS) indicó que la fecha de entrada en vigor está “pendiente de la guía federal”.
La ley eleva el límite de edad para los adultos sanos sin dependientes de 54 a 64 años. También se aplicará a los adultos sanos con hijos mayores de 14 años que vivan en casa. El proyecto de ley redujo la edad de los dependientes, que actualmente es menor de 18 años.
¿Cómo implementará Connecticut los requisitos laborales?
El Departamento de Servicios Sociales de Connecticut, que supervisa HUSKY y SNAP, está trabajando para abordar el aumento en la verificación de elegibilidad y la aplicación de ambos requisitos laborales.
Las autoridades predicen que Connecticut podría experimentar nuevos gastos de entre 20 y 50 millones de dólares, según un informe de la contraloría estatal. Es probable que esos costos se destinen a nueva tecnología y a un mayor número de personal para determinar qué residentes de HUSKY cumplen con los requisitos laborales y quiénes están exentos.
En Connecticut, el 73 % de los adultos que reciben Medicaid trabajan, según la organización sin fines de lucro KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation). Sin embargo, las autoridades estatales advierten que algunos afiliados que ya trabajan o que cumplen los requisitos para una exención podrían perder la cobertura, si no presentan la documentación necesaria que acredite que cumplen los requisitos para recibir beneficios.
“Se proyecta que muchas personas que cumplen con el requisito perderán la cobertura debido a los nuevos trámites de cumplimiento”, declaró el informe del Contralor Estatal en julio. “Muchas de las personas que no trabajan, por ejemplo, debido a responsabilidades de cuidado o una discapacidad, calificarían para una exención, pero se espera que incluso un número significativo de quienes deberían estar exentos sean dados de baja debido a la nueva burocracia que implica demostrarlo”.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/snap-spanish-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-08 10:56:09.839907

Officials on Thursday marked a milestone in flood protection for the Fargo area, with water from the Red River flowing through part of a channel designed to send floodwaters around the city.
The 30-mile Red River diversion is scheduled for completion in 2027 to protect the Fargo area’s more than 260,000 residents from flooding.
Thursday’s event took place at a dam near Horace, south of West Fargo. Officials had planned to remove plugs in berms that were keeping the Red River from entering the channel around the control structure, but recent heavy rains caused the river to top the berm, filling the channel. Instead, officials opened gates on the dam to mark the rerouting of the river.
The $3.2 billion project includes $850 million from the state of North Dakota and $750 million in federal funds. The control structure alone used $115 million of the federal funds.
The Red River Control Structure includes three 50-foot wide by 52-foot tall steel gates, each weighing nearly 300,000 pounds, according to a news release from Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D.

It is the largest of the three gated structures on a 22-mile earthen embankment.
“This has been a tremendous undertaking, requiring us to bring in partners from across all levels of government and from the private sector, but now, we are seeing tremendous results as the very heart of the project, the Red River Control Structure, is brought online,” Hoeven said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong applauded the cooperation on the project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The diversion also improves flood protection for Moorhead, Minnesota, with Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith taking part in the ceremony.
“Not since the opening of Garrison Dam in 1953 has a river of this size been intentionally rerouted through a manmade structure in North Dakota,” Armstrong said. “What is happening here today is beyond impressive, moving our state’s largest metro area one giant step closer to a more secure and prosperous future.”
The project has had some detractors. During floods, the dam could create a reservoir on farmland to the south of the north-flowing river.
Cash Aaland is an attorney who lives in an area that could be flooded. He said the dam was added to the diversion project to protect farmland near Fargo for possible future development at the expense of landowners who are being forced into the reservoir area.
He has joined with other attorneys to help fight for fair compensation in the area impacted by the diversion.
He said the group has settled about 30 cases where the Metro Flood Diversion Authority has used eminent domain to obtain easements on property that could be flooded by the dam. He said the group is still working on more than 50 cases.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In a series of decisions on transgender legislation this year, Gov. Kelly Ayotte has taken a page from her predecessor’s playbook.
Like former Gov. Chris Sununu, Ayotte signed two bills, House Bill 377 and House Bill 712, that ban gender-affirming care for minors, meaning the state will soon bar all forms of such care for people under 18, including medication and surgeries. But also like Sununu, Ayotte vetoed a bill, House Bill 148, that would have allowed businesses and organizations to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams by biological sex.
The result is a combination of decisions that has frustrated people on both sides of the debate. Conservatives and other Republicans sharply criticized Ayotte for vetoing HB 148, with one, Rep. Erica Layon of Derry, arguing she had “broken her promise to protect women.”
“I was stunned to learn that Governor Kelly Ayotte vetoed a bill meant to protect women’s spaces from men — an unthinkable rejection of women’s safety and rights,” Layon said in a statement in July. “… Many Granite Staters, especially women like myself, are saying that they feel betrayed, misled, and let down by the Governor’s broken promise.”
LGBTQ+ support organizations in New Hampshire, meanwhile, say that while they appreciate the veto on HB 148, the ban on gender-affirming care for minors will set back transgender youth and curtail parents’ rights to decide their children’s health care.
And they are hoping to fight the new laws and give advice to transgender teenagers and their families in the meantime.
“We’re lucky to be surrounded by states that provide gender-affirming health care to young people,” said Linds Jakows, the founder of 603 Equality, an advocacy group.
Options for teens and families
Advocates say they are working to inform families about their options.
To start, the new bans on gender-affirming breast surgeries and medication treatments for minors do not take effect until Jan. 1, activists note. And under the new laws, anyone who receives care before the ban will be able to continue to do so even after the ban takes effect.
“We are really asking folks in our orbit to publicize that the bill does not go into effect around puberty blockers and hormone blockers until Jan. 1, and if it is an appropriate choice for kids to seek care, we are strongly encouraging them to be in touch with Dartmouth Hitchcock and their gender affirming care clinic,” said Heidi Carrington Heath, executive director of New Hampshire Outright, an advocacy organization.
For teens and their families who want to begin after January 2026, the bans will require them to travel out of state to get care. That prospect carries with it numerous hurdles: It is more time-consuming, it could incur transportation and accommodation expenses, and it could mean a pricier cost of care if the out-of-state provider is not in that family’s insurance network.
There is a program that could help families do so, Jakows says: the Trans Youth Emergency Project. Run by the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ+ rights group that primarily operates in Southern states, the project allows families living in states where transgender care is banned $500 every three months to cover travel expenses to other states. 603 Equality has partnered with the Campaign for Southern Equality to bring the program to New Hampshire.
The project also provides one-on-one consulting for teens and families weighing their options, given the new bans.
“603 Equality and the Campaign for Southern Equality urge families with transgender youth to consult with their child’s physician as soon as possible about care plans,” the organizations wrote in a joint statement shortly after Ayotte signed HB 377 and HB 712 on Aug 1. “The Trans Youth Emergency Project is here to provide support to families of trans youth in New Hampshire in this difficult climate.”
Legal action contemplated
Many of the legal avenues to fight New Hampshire’s ban are now blocked by a U.S. Supreme Court decision from June. In U.S. v. Skrmetti, the court upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, and dismissed arguments that it was unconstitutional.
But to Chris Erchull, staff attorney at the GLTBQ+ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), that decision does not end all arguments against the new laws.
The Skrmetti case was based on the argument that Tennessee’s law violated the 14th Amendment by classifying teenage patients by transgender status and barring health care only to transgender teenagers. The court found, instead, that Tennessee’s law classified usage based on age and medical use, not trangender status, making it legal.
Erchull says the Supreme Court did not extend its decision to cases in which it is proven that a law is intended to discriminate against transgender people. And he said the court did not contemplate the argument that such a law could violate parents’ rights under the 14th Amendment to determine the health care of their children. Both of those arguments could be valid approaches to challenging New Hampshire’s law, Erchull argued.
Erchull also said there could be an avenue to challenge the laws under the state constitution, which also prohibits sex discrimination.
“I think we have ample evidence in this case that the motivation for the ban on medical care was an effort to single out transgender kids for different treatment and deny them access to care that they need,” he said in an interview.
Erchull declined to answer specific questions about whether GLAD is planning to sue the state in state or federal court to overturn the laws. The organization is currently involved in a federal lawsuit against a 2024 New Hampshire law that bars transgender girls in grades 5-12 from participating in girls’ sports.
Political advocacy continues
LGBTQ+ advocates say they’re hoping to shift the political narrative into one more supportive of trangender people. That means encouraging affected families to share their stories with voters and community members, they say.
“We know that the power of telling those stories can help to move the needle,” said Carrington Heath.
Jakows noted that 603 Equality has begun hosting listening sessions in Dover, New London, and Plymouth, and hopes to put on more.
“We want to spend more time organizing communities and getting people to talk to their friends and neighbors to share stories about transgender and nonbinary lives that counteract the flood of misinformation that is going on at the State House,” Jakows said.
Jakows said Ayotte had signed the bills even after members of her office had met with parents of transgender children, arguing the governor had sided with “fear and misinformation.”
Still, some of the advocacy efforts this year may have influenced Ayotte’s decision to veto HB 148, Jakows argued. Parents and teens reached out to Ayotte’s office urging the veto. And activists attempted more high-profile visibility efforts, too.
At Manchester’s pride parade on June 28, transgender performer Bobby Bratwurst took part in a float with a pointed message. Bratwurst, dressed as Lady Liberty, stood near a portable toilet and made statements like “going to the bathroom is a human right.”
And in May, demonstrators at the State House showed up during a House voting session dressed up as “genital observation police,” handing out cards to lawmakers entering bathrooms telling them they needed to have their private parts inspected by a Republican lawmaker before entering, The Boston Globe reported.
Those efforts kept the issue in the public eye, Jakows said, and may have helped push Ayotte to issue her veto.
“I believe there are important and legitimate privacy and safety concerns raised by biological males using places such as female locker rooms and being placed in female correctional facilities,” Ayotte wrote in her veto message. “At the same time, I see that House Bill 148 is overly broad and impractical to enforce, potentially creating an exclusionary environment for some of our citizens.”

It wasn’t a repeat of 2023, when an unmanned Chinese balloon flew across much of the United States. This week’s balloon was part of an U.S. military exercise taking place in Alaska.
The exercise is being organized by U.S. Northern Command, which covers North America, and NORAD — the North American Aerospace Defense Command, a unified Canadian-American group.
Maj. Jhanelle Haag, director of public affairs for the Alaskan Command and the Alaskan NORAD region, said the balloon was part of Arctic Edge 2025, taking place this month at sites across the state.
The exercise, pointed toward Russia, includes activities in Nome, Kotzebue, Cold Bay and other sites near the U.S.-Russian maritime border.
Some of the training includes practice in how to track and intercept incoming cruise missiles, according to information published by U.S. Northern Command, which covers North America.

This week’s balloon launch was from a South Dakota firm called Aerostar. 
Russ Van Der Werff, vice president of stratospheric solutions for Aerostar, said in an interview his firm has been in the Alaska area several times, both for commercial flights and testing, “but you know, it never fails — we’re down here in South Dakota, and we fly lots of these every year, and we still get, about every two years, a news story from the local folks going, what is this? It catches the attention.”
Van Der Werff said Aerostar makes a variety of products, including high altitude balloons like the one tested this week in Alaska.
The company’s balloons are designed for missions that require eyes in the sky, but ones that can fly longer and higher than drones or manned aircraft. 
Launching a satellite can be expensive and take time, he said, but a balloon can be brought into place quickly.
Balloons move at the orders of the wind, but Aerostar’s balloons are designed to change altitude, using outside air as ballast, which can change its altitude and stability. If the wind isn’t blowing the right way at a certain altitude, the balloon can rise or fall to a place where the wind is blowing the correct direction.
This spring, Aerostar tested a balloon that flew for 336 consecutive days over South Dakota, the longest flight ever by a controlled vehicle.
“We build a variety of different products, but within the high-altitude balloon space, we do equipment for commercial use, whether that’s disaster response, communication, environmental monitoring, scientific work, a lot of stuff with NASA, and then also the defense-related work, like we’re talking about here,” he said.
Neither Van Der Werff or military officials were willing to discuss details about what this week’s balloon was carrying, but typically, the company’s balloons are used for communication and “remote sensing,” putting cameras or other sensors above a particular target.
“It’s not all defense and those kinds of things,” he said, explaining that some balloons have been used to provide long-term aerial coverage of wildfires, and that the same balloon can track the spread of flames and provide a cellphone signal in remote areas. 
“That’s a good example of how … a communications and sensing platform regionally positioned and persistently stationed in one location over multiple months can really connect, protect and save lives,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/9239671-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-08 10:56:09.839907

Tate announced his exit from the race in a news release Friday. The Associated Press was the first to report the news.
“Over the last three months, I traveled across Michigan. … I listened. I asked questions. I shared in their frustration,” Tate said in a statement. “They told me the truth.

Tate added that he’ll continue to do what he can to support Democrats up and down the ballot, as well as the eventual Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate race in 2026.

(Courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.
In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

WILMINGTON— Delaware artist Shilpi’s solo exhibition, “Divine Nature,” is now on view through August 29 at the Mezzanine Gallery. 
Drawing on centuries-old Indian folk traditions, the show presents a vivid celebration of the sacred relationship between the natural world and divine energy.
Born and raised in India, Shilpi has lived in the U.S. for 13 years and currently resides in Middletown with her husband and daughter. Her background in fine arts includes a master’s degree and formal training in traditional Indian art forms. 
“I don’t lose a chance to learn whenever it comes towards the art,” Shilipi said. 
That commitment to artistic study is reflected in the precision and intricacy of her work. Shilpi works across a range of mediums including acrylics, oils, dry media, and graphite pencil shading. Her new show blends this technical rigor with visual storytelling rooted in Indian folk art.
“My theme is divine nature, because I’m presenting Indian folk art,” she explained. “Through that, we actually celebrate nature through divinity in folk art from India. So that’s what I am presenting in this show.”

Visitors to the gallery will encounter traditional forms such as Pichwai, Kalamkari, Madhubani, and Gond, interpreted through Shilpi’s contemporary lens. One featured work is a vibrant Tree of Life, done in the Madhubani style, symbolizing “growth, continuity, and spiritual vitality.” Other pieces include Krishna scenes among lotuses and peacocks in luminous Pichwai panels and rhythmic Gond-style creatures animated by dots and lines.
“Mostly you can see in my show peacock, cow, and you can see deer, all the beautiful elements from the nature I kept inside, and then I frame it so in one picture,” she said.
All of Shilipi’s work in Divine Nature is made entirely by hand. 
“These are all handmade, all created by myself. No cheating, nothing, no tracing,” she said. “We trained like that, if you were doing some designs this sidely, we have to do that side also through hand, so that you build focus.”
Shilpi’s work has previously been exhibited across Delaware and in New Jersey and India, including a sold-out solo show at The Gibby Center for the Arts in Middletown in 2024. Her accolades include first prize in the Camel Crylin Beginners Course sponsored by Camlin Limited, and multiple state-level awards in drawing, rangoli, henna tattoo, and embroidery.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image010-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Bureau of Investigation deleted the voicemail that prompted a police inquiry into the citizenship of a Lenexa City Council member, the bureau’s legal department says.
Melanie Arroyo, a clinical counselor and art therapist who was elected to the city council in 2021, revealed the police investigation during a council meeting Tuesday. She said police required her to provide proof of her 2018 naturalization before they closed the case.
The KBI and Lenexa police, responding to Kansas Reflector questions, revealed new details about the false allegation that sparked the investigation.
Law enforcement officials said a man called the KBI and left a voicemail in which he questioned Arroyo’s citizenship and requested an investigation. His complaint was based on assumptions he made about testimony Arroyo gave to the Legislature in February opposing a bill that would eliminate in-state tuition for immigrants.
In an interview for this story, Arroyo said the revelation of the deleted voicemail and the lack of substance in the complaint were “shocking and disturbing.”
“There are a couple of things here that further confirm for me that this was politically motivated,” Arroyo said.
Neither the KBI nor Lenexa police would disclose the identity of the Johnson County man who complained about Arroyo.
Kansas Reflector submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request to the KBI for a copy of the voicemail. The agency responded with a letter signed by “KBI Legal Division,” which said a special agent “confirmed that a message was left in our Lenexa office.”
“Once the substance of that message was forwarded on to the Lenexa Police Department we deleted the recording as it was no longer relevant to our agency,” the letter said.
The letter also said “the message, or any documents related to the message, are classified as criminal investigation records.”
The KBI’s records retention policy says special agent investigation files are to be retained for 70 years after a case is closed, and then transferred to state archives. A spokeswoman for the agency didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector questions about why the voicemail was deleted and whether the deletion was consistent with the records retention policy.
She also didn’t say why the KBI decided the voicemail was credible enough to forward to Lenexa police.

Danny Chavez, a master police officer who fields media inquiries for the Lenexa Police Department, provided a copy of the text of the email that KBI sent police. The caller’s name and number were omitted.
The KBI email said an individual “called with a question regarding the citizenship of a member of the Lenexa City Council. He stated that in February of 2025 Melanie Arroyo (possibly Melanie Arroyo-Lopez), a representative for Ward 3, gave testimony wanting to give illegals more benefits. During this testimony she acknowledged that she came to this country illegally as a child, but never acknowledged naturalization. He stated that this testimony was posted to the internet. He stated that to be a qualified elector, they had to be registered to vote and be born here or naturalized. He wanted to report this information for investigation.”
Chavez said police questioned Arroyo because city ordinance requires office holders to be a “qualified elector,” which means they must be a U.S. citizen.
“As we would with any complaint brought to our attention about matters pertaining to Lenexa City Code, we carried out our duty to investigate,” Chavez said.
Arroyo submitted written testimony in opposition to Senate Bill 254, which would have eliminated in-state tuition and other benefits for immigrants. State Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, provided a public platform for Attorney General Kris Kobach to promote the bill but refused to allow Arroyo and others to speak during a contentious hearing in February. The full Senate never took a vote on the proposal.
The caller who complained about Arroyo got several facts wrong. Although her testimony said she grew up “as an undocumented immigrant girl,” a reference to overstaying her visa, she said her family came to the country legally. Her testimony also said she “resolved my immigration status” in order to attend college in Kansas.
She earned a bachelor’s degree in studio art and psychology from the University of Saint Mary and earned master’s degrees from Emporia State University in clinical counseling and art therapy.
Arroyo, whose extended name is Arroyo Pérez, said the caller’s complaint was “alarming” and inconsistent with her testimony.
“So this person’s manufacturing something false,” she said. “And then for this person to say ‘maybe Melanie Arroyo-Lopez’ is f***ing racist and insulting. There’s nothing wrong with that last name, I’m just like, it’s not even remotely close to Pérez. How do you come up with that?”
State Rep. Susan Ruiz, D-Shawnee, said in an interview before Tuesday’s meeting that she believed Arroyo was targeted for being an “active and outspoken” city leader.
“What’s so upsetting about this is there’s no recourse,” Ruiz said. “Her privacy was invaded. Her civil rights were invaded. She gets no chance to confront the person that made the allegation. She doesn’t even know who it is. The police won’t tell her. They won’t even tell her lawyer.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8050265-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

American politics have been dominated by two political parties for far too long, especially since both seem to primarily serve the interests of their wealthy donors.
The good news is that both major parties are showing signs of both internal and external dissent at the national and state level.
At the national level, the GOP is facing the grim reality that the policies, actions, and scandals of President Trump are resulting in the lowest approval rating for any president from either party at this point in their term.
Independents are leading the drop, which has the GOP so panicked it’s turned to desperate measures such as immediate redistricting to attempt to avert losses that will change the balance of Congress in the mid-term elections.
That’s no surprise since those policies overwhelmingly favor the mega-wealthy while negatively impacting everyone else. The glaring example would be the result of the Big Ugly Bill — called the greatest upward shift of wealth in the nation’s history — while costs for basic necessities like groceries and utilities and the national debt skyrocket.
Then there’s Trump’s $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch’s Wall St. Journal for publishing a “bawdy” birthday card he allegedly sent to his longtime friend and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Trump’s MAGA base is so up in arms Speaker of the House Mike Johnson adjourned the House early to avoid a vote on releasing the Epstein files.
Closer to home, three Montana Republican senators are suing their own party claiming “the state party’s actions against them violated its governing rules and the constitutional protection of legislative immunity.” Why would the GOP hassle it’s own legislators? Apparently for the crime of working with Democrat legislators.
The Democrats have their hands full, too. On the national level the genocide being committed by Israel against the Palestinians as Netanyahu seeks “full conquest” of Gaza is splitting the party. As horrifying pictures of mass starvation and utter destruction flood the media, long-standing Democrat support for Israel is increasingly being opposed by Democrat candidates since the U.S. provides billions to Israel annually, including the deadly weaponry being used on helpless Palestinian civilians.
Meanwhile, here in Montana, the Democrats are going after each other with the release of a controversial memo titled “Tangible Damages” citing “certain Montana legislative Democrats’ decisions to work unquestioningly with the Republican Governor and his Republican legislative allies.”
If that sounds mighty familiar to the Montana GOP’s efforts to control and command its own members without question, no surprise! The fact is those in power want to preserve the two-party system so they can continue their R v.

But just as the Independents are fleeing Trump’s chaotic and authoritarian rule, those who are more concerned with the benefit to themselves, their fellow citizens, and society at large are finding the two party system isn’t really delivering for them.
The bottom line is that our populace has much more in common than in conflict and are increasingly tired of being told we only have two choices — R or D.

By the time the winds started blowing the Palisades Fire from the Santa Monica Mountains toward Will Rogers State Historic Park on Jan. 7, California State Parks staff were boxing up artifacts where the famous 1930s vaudeville actor built his ranch house. 
A color-coded sticker system marked which art, books, ceramics and other objects to prioritize. Park resource advisors and facility staff packed three pickup trucks to the brim with roughly 150 objects, worth more than $3 million today, before making their escape toward Interstate 405.

Noa Khalili, acting senior environmental scientist of the state parks’ Angeles district: “As we drove away, we could hear on the radio the entry alarm, the fire was bursting through the windows.”

In the end, Los Angeles County’s Palisades Fire killed at least 12 people, and damaged or destroyed more than 7,000 structures. It incinerated 8,000 acres of state parks land, including Will Rogers’ ranch house and the historic ranch motel at Topanga State Park. The department completed debris removal in February, but the long road to restore the parks still lays ahead.
In addition to the $3.6 million that lawmakers set aside in the state budget to rebuild Will Rogers park and its visitor center, the parks department received a one-time $1.5 million grant from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for fire resilience projects. The money helps pay for hardening new and existing buildings against fires, clearing defensive space around facilities and coordinating with fire agencies to maintain roads.
Because Will Rogers park is considered a historic landscape, restoration efforts must remain consistent with the park’s history, said Richard Fink, the Angeles district’s superintendent. That means likely keeping eucalyptus trees, which are fairly flammable, in the landscape plan, but replacing them with a less flammable variety. Park staff also have to be on the lookout for invasive plants, including the arundo donax, a giant, highly flammable reed.
For the next several months, the department plans to gather public feedback about its restoration plans. It’s unclear when the parks will be fully restored, but Fink says the department is aiming for a soft opening in late summer to welcome visitors, and a bigger grand opening in the fall.
In the meantime, as the rescued items sit inside a storage facility in Sacramento, the parks outside continue their own revival.

Khalili: “Because of the rain after the fire, all the seeds, stumps and root balls began to sprout almost immediately. We’re actually seeing really great recovery across the landscape. It’s kind of beautiful to see.”

Rooftop solar panel saga continues

The California Supreme Court handed environmentalists and homeowners with rooftop solar panels a victory Thursday, issuing a ruling that directs a lower court to revisit its earlier decision to uphold compensation rates for solar installations, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
In 2022 the California Public Utilities Commission slashed compensation payments utilities paid homeowners with rooftop solar panels by around 75%, saying that it was reversing what it considered unfair subsidies to affluent solar customers. Environmental groups sued, arguing that regulators didn’t properly consider benefits to customers and disadvantaged communities.
An appeals court sided with the commission, using a legal standard that gives more weight to the regulators’ decisions. But California’s high court ruled that that lower court “erred” by using this standard, and kicked back the case to the appeals court for reconsideration.

More camping charges dropped

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
As cities crack down on homeless encampments, police in many places are citing and arresting more Californians for camping-related offenses. But it’s still rare for a case to go to trial, which is frustrating advocates who want to challenge anti-camping ordinances in court. 
Case in point: Prosecutors in Fresno have dropped charges against Joseph Quinney, who was set to be the first person tried under a new ordinance banning sleeping on public property. Prosecutors decided not to pursue the case, one week before the Aug. 13 trial date, said attorney Kevin Little, who represents Quinney.
While Quinney is “extremely relieved,” arresting people and refusing to prosecute them is a waste of everyone’s time, Little said.
Little also represents Wickey Two Hands, who was scheduled to go on trial in April for camping before that case, too, was dismissed at the last minute. 
Quinney’s case stemmed from arrests in October for camping and in 2019 for unauthorized lodging. The Fresno County District Attorney’s Office dismissed the 2019 charge “in the interest of justice” because it was an old, nonviolent offense, according to spokesperson Taylor Long. 
The city attorney’s office, which dismissed the October charge, did not respond to a request for comment.

I hope for a future where discussions can take place in a productive, civil manner and where we build bridges rather than jump to label those who don’t agree.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Bossange: Will the good news coming out of Burlington make a difference?.","This commentary is by John Bossange of South Burlington. He is a retired middle school principal and a board member of Better (not bigger) Vermont.


At long last, there is some good news coming out of Burlington. 
It comes in the form of an inspiring group calling itself Building Burlington’s Future. Teams of local community leaders, past and present, have created a nonprofit organization dedicated to building an affordable, safe and livable future for Burlington. 
I am hopeful that all of the leaders in our city, regardless of political party affiliation, will engage with Building Burlington’s Future. 
The organization aspires to be a dedicated and coordinated force for change by connecting grassroots advocacy and policy development. The group sees what we all see, every day and every night: a struggling downtown. 
The cost of housing is pushing families out of the city, and gaps in public safety and health services are putting individuals and families at risk. 
The good news is that Building Burlington’s Future will focus on developing practical policies that will make the city more affordable, safe and livable. They will do this work collaboratively, with input from Burlington’s wealth of direct service providers, business leaders and everyday residents to drive change that is needed now and will last.
Since launching in June, the nonprofit has been supporting positive and productive action in Burlington. I expect that we will soon see initiatives from Building Burlington’s Future on important issues, such as affordable housing, public safety, the expansion of community service personnel, the retention of police officers and the encouragement of public health initiatives that support those experiencing homelessness.
Our community needs this kind of action more than ever before. We need people to show up downtown to community events and activities, to attend public meetings, and to participate in conversations that seek solutions. Building Burlington’s Future promises to bring more people into the conversation — and for many of us, we are grateful for that effort. 
The questions that remain on my mind are: How will our elected leaders serving on the Burlington City Council react to the formation of an independent advocacy organization? Will our leaders on both sides of the political spectrum be open to feedback and new ideas? Will they be receptive to integrating action steps coming from the Building Burlington’s Future? 
I’m not sure what to expect once the organization begins to advocate for policies that will require integration and implementation by the city. 
We know that Burlington, like many other places, can be resistant to change. We also know that some of our hardest conversations can often take unproductive and divisive turns. 
Some examples of this include the conversation about the removal of a “Food not Cops” feeding location in a public parking garage to City Hall Park without a permit, allowing cars of unhoused individuals to park overnight at Perkins Pier or the growing tent settlements along the bike path and in the Intervale. We must come together in a partnership if there are to be long-lasting solutions.
I believe the most important challenge facing the city right now is the environment that is creating a lucrative and illegal market for drug trafficking and dealing. In my opinion, drug dealing, not just usage, is the greatest threat to public safety in Burlington. On that issue alone there should be no debate on our City Council. Helping the most vulnerable population deal with their substance use is critical if we are to address our city’s drug crisis.
I hope for a future where discussions can take place in a productive, civil manner and where we build bridges rather than jump to label those who don’t agree. I believe Building Burlington’s Future can play a constructive role in creating some common ground for positive, productive change. 
If you attend a City Council meeting these days, too often you are likely to encounter people who are just there to criticize or advocate against things. That negative rhetoric just compounds our problems and the perception people have about Burlington. 
We need an organization that is willing to convene all the citizens of Burlington, including tax-paying residents, renters, business owners, vulnerable individuals, students and, of course, visitors. 
This is a critical and timely opportunity to combine resources and ideas — and move beyond political ideology and rhetoric. 
I hope readers of this commentary and other interested citizens will join me in welcoming Building Burlington’s Future to the table and participate in meaningful conversation. We need to ensure that Burlington’s future will be affordable, safe and livable for everyone.

Rural hospital leaders say the recently approved federal budget plan will impact patients no matter what type of insurance they have, as more Missourians defer care and rely more on emergency departments (Meg Cunningham/The Beacon).Missouri’s 67 rural hospitals are pondering a dramatically different future under President Donald Trump’s new budget plan.
The recently approved budget bill will slash federal Medicaid spending by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. By some estimates, it could lead to 8.6 million people nationwide losing health coverage.
Various estimates conclude that between 130,000 and 170,000 Missourians could lose coverage under the state’s Medicaid program, known as MO HealthNet, over the next decade.
And even if you have commercial insurance, the impact on hospital operations and finances could still affect your health care. As people delay treatment for their health conditions due to a lack of insurance, they’ll start relying more on the emergency room as their primary form of health care, experts say.
That will lead to more crowded emergency departments. Moreover, the burden to pay for uninsured patients will shift onto the hospitals that provide the care, and eventually back to patients.
With the budget plan in motion and spending cuts materializing, Missouri’s hospitals are now taking a look at their finances and preparing for an uptick in costs.
For rural Missourians, even those who aren’t on Medicaid, it means the types of health care available to them in the form of obstetric units, primary care providers or specialty providers could be changing.
Or their nearby hospital could be gone altogether.
“We are likely going to see rural hospital closures,” said Sheldon Weisgrau, the vice president of health policy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, in a press briefing.
“We have not had any rural hospitals close since we expanded the Medicaid program,” he said. “We are likely to see rural hospitals close because they operate on the financial edge.”
 What do worsening hospital finances under Medicaid cuts mean for you? 

Mercy, which is based in the St. Louis area, operates 112 hospitals and emergency rooms across Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas and has a large footprint in rural Missouri. Mercy estimates that the budget will lead to bigger revenue losses every year.
Five years from now, they estimate, they’ll lose $300 million in revenue annually.
“That’s going to mean we’re going to have to radically look at how we deliver care differently — that is still responsive to our communities,” said Cheryl Matejka, the executive vice president and chief financial officer at Mercy. “It’s going to be different for us to survive and thrive.”
Under the plan, Missouri stands to lose an estimated $23 billion in federal funding over the next decade, according to the Missouri Foundation for Health.* Much of Missouri’s federal money covers the cost of Medicaid for the Affordable Care Act expansion group, which voters approved coverage for with an amendment to the state constitution in 2020.
The new federal budget restricts how states and hospitals can pay for the services they provide by limiting the fees that states can collect from health care providers. It also puts limits on what states can pay hospitals to help them fill gaps in their finances for treating Medicaid patients.
Broken down by year, Missouri’s federal funding for Medicaid will drop about 20% annually as the plan moves forward, Weisgrau said.
“All of this is going to have a disproportionate impact in rural communities,” Weisgrau said.
The Missouri Foundation for Health analyzed the budget plan, he added, and found that rural health care providers could lose 21 cents of every dollar they currently get from Medicaid.
According to KFF, hospitals overall had an operating margin of 5.2% in 2023. For rural hospitals, that margin was 3.1%.
The bulk of the concern stems from an expected rise in uncompensated care — hospitals treating patients even if they cannot pay.
“When folks lose their insurance coverage, it doesn’t mean they don’t continue to get sick,” Weisgrau said. “A lot of them stay out of the health care system because they know they can’t afford it.”
Once their health deteriorates to a certain point, they go to the emergency room, where they are required to be treated, even if they cannot pay for that care.
Mercy, for example, sets aside part of its budget to account for that cost.
“We give away about half a billion dollars of uncompensated or unreimbursed care,” said John Mohart, the executive vice president and chief operation officer for Mercy. “Some of that is for Medicaid patients already, because it doesn’t cover the costs that we have.”
But for smaller hospitals, the flexibility to provide that uncompensated care isn’t there. Fewer insured people will only increase costs.
“If you see an uninsured patient, then you probably have to assume that there is a pretty good chance you’re just going to have to eat those costs,” said Timothy McBride, a public health expert and economist at the Washington University School of Public Health.
As a result, even those covered by commercial insurance could see their premiums rise to help cover the care.
“These costs are passed on to the rest of us,” Weisgrau said. “We will see private insurance premiums going up. Even folks who have good coverage from their employers and think they might be immune from some of these Medicaid cuts  will see impacts of this down the line.”
 How far will the rural hospital fund go in saving at-risk hospitals? 

To help offset some of the costs rural hospitals are taking on, senators in Washington lobbied for the inclusion of a rural hospital stabilization fund. The budget included $50 billion for rural hospitals over the next five years with the possibility of renewing the fund in the future.
Half of it will be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, while the other half will flow to states to then send to hospitals.
But the fund won’t be enough to offset the losses rural hospitals are anticipating.
Medicaid spending in rural parts of the country is expected to fall by $137 billion over the next decade — $87 billion more than was allocated to the rural hospital fund, according to KFF.
And even those estimates, KFF said, are modest because they don’t account for how states may change the way they fund Medicaid.
During negotiations surrounding the budget bill, senators asked the University of North Carolina Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research to analyze how many rural hospitals may be at risk under the plan.
Their report found that nearly 340 rural hospitals were at risk nationwide, based on the rate of Medicaid patients they serve and their consecutive years of financial losses.
In Missouri, four hospitals were considered at-risk, while in Kansas, six hospitals were listed.
One of those hospitals is Bothwell Regional Health Center in Sedalia, the city’s largest employer with more than 1,000 employees.
In 2024, the hospital posted its first profit since 2018, Bothwell CEO Lori Wightman said in a press release in July. Notably, Medicare and Medicaid provided 78% of the payments for its patients.
“These programs pay well below the actual cost of providing care,” Wightman said in the release. “Commercial insurance alone cannot close the gap, and that is where subsidies available to rural hospitals are essential. Unfortunately, the cost of providing care, from personnel to technology, continues to rise making a difficult situation harder to stabilize.”
Other Missouri hospitals included on the list were Scotland County Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Parkland Health Center in Bonne Terre and Lafayette Regional Health Center in Lexington — Sen. Josh Hawley’s hometown.
Studies show that after a rural hospital closure, low-income and elderly patients were more likely to defer or skip their health care altogether because of transportation challenges.
Rural hospital closures also lead to a loss of physicians. One study found that the closure of a rural hospital led to an 8.3% drop in primary care physicians and a 4.8% drop in obstetricians and gynecologists.
“Health care providers are big employers,” Weisgrau said. “They are big users of local supplies and commodities. All of that will have to be reduced. People will lose jobs. Economies will decline as a result of these cuts.”

David Saint-Amand
David Saint-Amand is board president of the Indian Wells Valley Water District.


Re: “How deep-pocketed groundwater users are stalling California’s sustainability plans“
Assembly Bill 1413 seeks to quietly rewrite California’s water laws, raising alarm among local water agencies, business groups, lawmakers and many advocates of California’s agriculture industry. The Indian Wells Valley Water District in eastern Kern County has serious concerns about the proposal’s threats to groundwater rights, due process, transparency and scientific accountability. 
The bill would limit judicial oversight and fundamentally alter the role of groundwater sustainability plans in California, potentially treating them as a legally binding determination of water rights. The Indian Wells water district is undergoing an adjudication process to protect property rights, and officials like me worry that AB 1413 would prohibit courts from reviewing the science behind these plans, as well as potential errors.
Adjudication remains one of the few tools to independently evaluate a sustainability plan’s conclusion. According to an analysis for the state Senate’s Committee on Natural Resources and Water, at least five of California’s 94 priority groundwater basins are currently under adjudication, suggesting that AB 1413 addresses a localized issue, not a statewide need. Dozens more have already completed the process.
As written, AB 1413 sets a dangerous precedent. Lawmakers need to at least amend it to protect due process, uphold judicial oversight and ensure fair groundwater management.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/06102021_Madera_Drought_SH_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

After hundreds of international students lost their status this spring, then regained it following lawsuits, the uncertainty of it happening again has created fear. Some students say they’ve changed the routes they take on campus, the topics they research, and what they post on social media.


International college students are learning that speech isn’t as free as they thought in the United States. After President Donald Trump began his second term, hundreds of international students lost their student status as part of an executive order cracking down on immigration and alleged antisemitism. 
While lawsuits resulted in many of those students having their status reinstated since April, the uncertainty of it happening again has created fear among international students, particularly within the University of California system, where international students make up 13.6% of student enrollment as of Fall 2024. 
Some international students told CalMatters they have changed their involvement in campus activities, from the routes they take on campus to avoid free speech areas, to the topics they include in their research projects, to scrubbing their social media posts and limiting their political activism. 
The fear began spreading in late January, when the White House released a fact sheet about Trump’s Executive Order 14188, “Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism,” stating, “resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you.” Additionally, it mentioned cancelling visas of “Hamas sympathizers” on college campuses. 
Since then, there have been a few high-profile arrests of international students, including Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia University, a legal permanent resident who was involved in leading pro-Palestinian protests, and Rümeysa Öztürk at Tufts University, a Turkish national who co-wrote an op-ed asking her university to divest. Khalil has since been released on bail and Öztürk was released by order of a federal judge. Still, these detentions have triggered concerns among international students about how their actions could be used against them.

Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently announced the U.S. would start “aggressively” revoking Chinese student visas, more specifically, those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in fields that are considered “critical.” 
Federal officials haven’t released any information about how many international students had their status revoked, or which campuses they attend. However, Inside Higher Ed compiled news reports of more than 1,800 students nationwide, including over 200 in California, whose status were revoked in the spring.
CalMatters reached out to all 10 UC campuses inquiring about the number of international students who have had their statuses reinstated, but only two responded. As of April 28, UC San Diego’s 35 terminated student visas had been reactivated, and one student was deported. At UC Santa Barbara, 11 of the 12 visas had been reinstated, though the “situation remains fluid,” said Media Relations Manager Kiki Reyes. 
International students are chilling their speech
None of the international students interviewed for this story wanted their names or areas of study published due to fears of being identified and having their status revoked for speaking publicly.
At UC Berkeley, a sophomore told CalMatters that she was involved in campus activism for about a year and a half until about March, when she saw international students losing their visas and heard rumors of immigration enforcement agents on campus. Her thoughts on protesting have changed drastically. “Everything I say can be used against me,” she said. She has been coming up with creative ways to be involved while trying to keep herself and other international students safe. For example, she participates in student club meetings, where she feels she can speak more privately. 
“I came to the United States because those are things that I wasn’t comfortable doing in my country,” the sophomore said. “I wasn’t comfortable speaking out. It was like a dictatorship, and that’s why I came to America, which is, like, where the freedom is supposed to be. And then I got met with this. It’s really, really disappointing.”
Also at UC Berkeley, a junior from the UK said that last year she felt much freer. During the campus pro-Palestinian protests last year, she wanted to participate but was too busy. Her regret has now turned into relief because if anyone had taken a picture of her near a protest, she believes she would have suffered consequences. 
“Under a Biden administration, I would have felt like I was free to criticize the administration. I was free to take part in protests,” she said. “Because of Trump’s recent decision — especially with the students at Columbia — I feel like I can’t be anywhere near a protest.”

An international graduate student at another UC — he does not want to name his campus in fear of not passing his dissertation — is working on a research project about the interplay of international politics and media. His research paper includes a section on human rights violations and genocide. Initially, he included coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Faculty advised him to remove the parts about Israel from his final project, he said.  
“It does not have that big an impact on the entire project…, but personally I’m just disappointed that I could not talk about it in my final events,” the graduate student said. “I will be presenting this to a set of faculty from my department, and they will be grading that, determining whether I can graduate or not based on the paper. It impacts a little bit on my department, and regarding freedom of speech.”
Balancing the support of Jewish students and due process 
In his executive order, Trump promises to protect the civil rights of Jewish citizens, who have faced harassment, physical threats and assault on college campuses.  
UC Irvine Jewish student Shir — who requested not to use her full name because she fears discrimination – believes if a student on a visa is “celebrating terror explicitly,” their student status should be evaluated. However, she notes the importance of drawing the line at terror and hate and not overstepping legal boundaries.   
“Skipping [due] process doesn’t protect [against] antisemitism, it only creates more hate in the system,” Shir said in an email. “We are all humans first and should be treated as such.”
While she supports students’ right to protest, Shir wrote “there have been students repeating and glorifying slogans and ideas used by Hamas, a terrorist organization. This is where action is needed. I and many other Jewish students have been confronted at these protests and on campus, told I am a terrorist, that my family in Israel deserves to die, and had protesters outright justify Hamas’ actions to me.”

Raquel Aldana, a law professor at UC Davis, said the language being used by the Trump administration about antisemitism is extremely broad and could be read to include anything that is anti-Israel. 
“One of the areas they’re going to be watching is how these institutions of higher learning respond to allegations of antisemitism, which could end up targeting foreign students,” Aldana said. 
The Trump administration’s antisemitism task force is investigating allegations of antisemitic incidents at at least 10 college campuses across the country, including UCLA, UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California.  
Aldana said she didn’t understand what problems the investigations are meant to address — adding that it “feels like a political move and not a true concern.” 
International students limited on travel options
Three UC campuses that responded to CalMatters said they’ve sent communications to international students to use caution if they plan to travel outside the country.
Right before spring break, international students said they received travel warning emails from their international student offices about the risks of leaving the country. At UC Berkeley, the sophomore student said an email from the Berkeley International Office said the office could not guarantee international students’ ability to return to the U.S. if they left the country, even though the U.S. State Department’s website states continuing students may enter the country at any time.
“We had to spend our spring break in the U.S., [when] people want to go home,” the UC Berkeley sophomore said. “Not having that option is really disappointing, the fact that no one at the university can advocate for the small percentage of [international] students they have, … is insane to me.”
For the summer break, UC Berkeley’s International Office sent another email in May that urged “caution” for continuing international students who planned to travel out of the country. On June 4, the White House released a Presidential Proclamation announcing restrictions from 19 designated countries to enter the U.S. As a result, UC Davis and UC Irvine recommended that international students from those 19 countries not leave the U.S. because the travel ban may prevent them from re-entering. 
Student newspapers face ethical dilemmas 
Öztürk, the Tufts university student arrested after criticizing her university’s response to the Israel-Hamas war, returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release from a detention facility in Louisiana in May. Her arrest spurred college publications to take extra precautions.
Adalia Luo, editor-in-chief of UC San Diego’s student news organization The Guardian, and Chris Ponce, editor-in-chief of The California Aggie at UC Davis, said their opinion departments have been making changes. Luo said her organization has removed names from articles by international student writers upon request. Luo added that the priority is protecting the students even though removing a byline weakens a story’s credibility. 
UC Davis’ student news staff has discussed a similar issue. Ponce said they’re not simply granting anonymity for anyone who asks. However, they are “now more than ever” open to removing whole articles if it means protecting the status of international students, which they are doing on a case-by-case basis.

One student newspaper is challenging the Trump administration’s policies regarding noncitizen students. The Stanford Daily, represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, is suing Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over immigration laws that allow the revocation of student visas for protected speech.
According to a letter from the editors, far fewer international students are willing to speak to The Daily, and those who do request anonymity. “Several international members of our own staff even left their positions at The Daily. Many of those who stayed requested to stop writing news articles related to protests or political events on campus and asked that their previous articles be taken off our website,” the letter states.
The junior at UC Berkeley said she writes for a campus political magazine. Once the Trump administration started targeting international students, she asked for the articles to be taken down, and the magazine obliged.
“I didn’t want my name affiliated with criticisms of the administration, as that would either risk me getting deported or a future visa being rejected. I believe the articles are still inaccessible, and my goal is that they remain so for the rest of Trump’s term,” the junior said. 
Despite fears about sharing their viewpoints publicly, international students say it’s important to be advocates for themselves and each other. 
The UC Berkeley sophomore said international students should continue to consider their safety as well as their rights. 
“You should be taking precautions to keep your status and to keep yourself safe, but to also know that if we back down, change will never happen,” the sophomore said.

But Donald Trump doesn't follow court rules and his latest ploy, suing all 15 federal judges in Maryland, may be the most dangerous, writes Deborah Jeon.","The U.S. District Courthouse in Baltimore. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Unprecedented. Authoritarian. An open assault the rule of law. That’s what legal commentators across the political spectrum are calling it.
As a civil rights lawyer who has practiced in Maryland’s federal courts for more than 35 years, I will add ominous.
Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is crashing through yet another constitutional guardrail, threatening to incapacitate the judiciary by suing every sitting judge in Maryland. It’s a looming constitutional crisis: an assault on the judiciary’s role enforcing the Constitution, launched by a feckless Justice Department doing the bidding of a president who views the rule of law as an obstacle to evade rather than a principle to uphold.
In the first weeks of August, this internecine battle comes to a Baltimore courtroom, where America’s Executive will square off against its Judiciary in a momentous showdown testing whether our Constitution endures.
What prompted the clash?
In his role overseeing the court’s internal operations, Maryland’s chief judge issued a modest administrative order similar to those used by appellate courts around the country in certain high-stakes immigration cases. The order is aimed at ensuring judges have breathing room to do their work, by requiring the government to pause, by no more than two business days, the deportation of people who have filed habeas petitions challenging their removal.
To be clear, this order is a simple docket management tool necessary to protect the court’s ability to do its job. It was necessitated by the chaos unleashed by the malicious new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) scheme of swiftly and strategically moving migrants seized here to some far-flung place. It’s a shell game designed to foreclose court review – as happened in the cases of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and many others trying to protect themselves from unlawful deportations.

And it’s a shell game that’s forced judges to try to rule on cases within minutes of their filing — sometimes on weekends or in the middle of the night.
Under binding court rules, disgruntled parties – here, ICE – must challenge adverse judicial rulings by appealing to a higher court, not by suing the judge. That approach respects the inherent sovereignty of the branches of government.
Instead, President Trump filed this bombastic lawsuit, in which Justice Department lawyers hauled all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges into court as defendants. This improper taxpayer-funded lawsuit directly threatens the separation of powers, upends the constitutional order, and is profoundly disruptive to court processes.
Since starting his second term, Donald Trump has aggressively followed the Project 2025 playbook to seize and consolidate power in the Executive Branch. He does this by using Executive Orders that bypass Congress, politicizing the federal bureaucracy, and ignoring or pretending to misunderstand court rulings he disagrees with.
This has triggered a cascade of litigation challenging executive overreach. Since Jan. 20, more than 500 lawsuits have been filed challenging the administration’s lawless conduct, with new challenges every day.
Dozens of these are here in Maryland, including individual habeas cases like those covered by the court’s order and sweeping challenges that have led Maryland judges to enjoin as unconstitutional administration initiatives restricting birthright citizenship, free speech in schools, and deportations without due process.
Administration officials have responded to this deluge of litigation and courtroom losses with unhinged name-calling, dangerous attacks on individual judges, threats of impeachment, overt attempts to evade the courts’ jurisdiction, and even outright defiance.
And now, this lawsuit.
The Constitution’s framers knew that liberty depends on preventing any single branch of our government from amassing unchecked power. They created a system of co-equal branches precisely to prevent the kind of executive dominance over the judiciary that this lawsuit seeks.
Maryland’s federal judges – represented by renowned conservative lawyer and former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement – warn of exactly this. Urging dismissal of the case because allowing the executive to sue judges themselves for doing their jobs is “fundamentally incompatible with the separation of powers.” Retired federal judges filing “friend of the court” briefs agree, warning that by placing “two coequal branches of government at loggerheads,” the DOJ lawsuit “threatens the judicial role to its core.”
If the administration can flout the appeals process and sue federal judges whenever it disagrees with their rulings, this tactic will inevitably spread, with chilling implications. Any court could find itself in the crosshairs, incapacitated simply for doing its constitutional duty.
This all comes to a head on Aug. 13, when a specially assigned federal judge from the Western District of Virginia convenes a hearing at which the United States government will do battle against itself.
We can only hope the Constitution prevails.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/district-court-2-newsletter-e1720827172693.jpg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

(Photo: Northern Nevada Hopes)A July executive order issued by Donald Trump that seeks to crack down on homelessness by pressuring cities to criminalize unhoused people or push them into institutions is riddled with “glaring contradictions” that ignore lack of mental health facilities and supportive housing, service providers say.  
In the meantime, states and cities that don’t comply with the order are at risk of losing federal funding, a consequence that has already prompted some providers to cut back on services.
Complicating the challenges, local officials and service providers in Nevada are also wondering how they’ll cope if health care and homeless program spending cuts in Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget requests are enacted into law later this year.
Trump’s July 24 executive order, which is also critical of harm reduction programs like providing clean needles, has already prompted Northern Nevada HOPES to end its safe syringe program.
“Because we get federal funding, we decided it was important to stop offering that service so we didn’t receive federal funding cuts,” said Sharon Chamberlain, CEO for Northern Nevada HOPES.  
Safe syringes have “proven to be the number one way to prevent the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C, prevent overdoses and get people into treatment,” Chamberlain said. 
For the White House to discourage the program by financially threatening organizations that provide it, Chamberlain said, “is really detrimental.”
The Change Point syringe service program that the health center provided for about a decade will instead be offered by Northern Nevada Harm Reduction Alliance, a nonprofit community organization, Chamberlain added. 
Homelessness across the country has risen in recent years, with Nevada seeing an estimated 17% increase in 2024, according to a December report from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development. 
Homeless advocates and service providers have long warned there isn’t enough affordable or  accessible housing to meet the needs of those experiencing homelessness or at-risk of entering homelessness.
Trump’s executive order contains no provisions to increase the amount of available housing, and in fact calls for “ending support for ‘housing first’ policies,” saying they “deprioritize accountability.”
Anti-homeless camping bans marked by procedural pitfalls and counterproductive criminalizing

Instead, the order calls for federal agencies like HUD to prioritize federal funding to local governments that enact anti-homeless camping bans or anti-squatting ordinances, push for stricter punishment for drug use, and force unhoused people into mental health or drug abuse treatment. 
Several Nevada jurisdictions have passed or enhanced anti-homeless camping bans in the last few years.
“Many of the items in this executive order really fly in the face of what we currently know to be the most successful treatment models and the most successful evidence-based practices, such as housing first and  harm reduction,” said Catrina Peters, the homeless services coordinator with Washoe County.
Clark County Manager Kevin Schiller said Nevada’s most populous county is in a “holding pattern” and waiting for guidance from agencies outlining how to comply in order to continue to receive federal funding. 
Trump also wants cities and states to push “homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment.”
Not only does the order use “archaic, outdated and charged language” against unhoused people, the approach of mass institutionalization wouldn’t work, said Benjamin Castro, the executive director of Reno Initiative for Shelter & Equality. 
“We’ve already demonstrated that it was not efficient or popular,” Castro said of institutionalizing unhoused people with mental health disorders. “To execute some sort of national program like that, we’re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars to create these facilities and then to staff them.” 
Trump issued the order calling on local officials to criminalize homelessness and push unhoused people into treatment the same month he signed his tax and domestic spending legislation, which includes steep cuts to Medicaid. 
Nevada homelessness, housing crisis will only get worse under Trump budget plans, providers warn

And in his pending budget request, Trump has proposed slashing HUD’s budget by more than 40%, which could decimate city and state funding for homeless assistance programs. 
“I think that’s one of the glaring contradictions of this order,” Castro said. “We’re talking about putting focus on institutionalizing people with mental health issues, but we’re not funding mental health facilities.”
‘We don’t have anywhere to put them’
Whether it is placing unhoused people in housing programs, like permanent supportive housing, or getting those who need it into mental health treatment beds, Castro said there is a capacity issue.
“You have people who are living out on the streets, and even if they wanted to get into the emergency shelter they couldn’t because the shelters were full,” he said. 
The nonprofit Castro operates, RISE, is one of the few places in Northern Nevada that provides housing for people going through substance abuse treatment. 
When it comes to getting anyone, in particular those on the streets, into treatment, one of the first obstacles case managers face is figuring out who pays for the services. 
For people who rely on Medicaid, “there are very few providers that will actually provide the services that are needed, because Medicaid is complicated,” Castro said.
 “It doesn’t pay much,” he said, adding it’s a challenge for providers to get reimbursement for services in a timely manner. “Most service providers don’t want to deal with it.”
If a person who is unhoused is experiencing a mental health crisis, “they end up going to the hospital, but usually they end up going to jail because we don’t have anywhere else for people to go,” he added 
For all its flaws, Castro said Medicaid currently helps people get connected to mental health treatment options. 
That could soon change when the Medicaid provisions Trump’s spending cuts and tax cuts bill signed into law last month take effect in 2027.
The law is estimated to kick  17 million Americans off Medicaid or Affordable Care 
Act coverage, with about 114,500 Nevadans at risk of losing their health care. There are nearly 738,000 Nevadans enrolled in Medicaid, including 15% with chronic conditions, according to KFF.  
Trump’s order is “saying we want to push people toward treatment,” said Peters, the Washoe County homeless services coordinator. “But when we’re removing a payer source, we’re just removing opportunities for people to be able to access that resource.”
“Substance abuse treatment for people experiencing homelessness needs to be provided in a dignified and humane way,” Peters said, “and forcing people to institutions is the exact opposite of that, and has shown to not be a successful strategy.” 
While Trump’s order calls for  unhoused people to be swept off the streets and into treatment facilities, it does not detail where they could go or how those facilities  would be funded. 
“Is it implied that we are supposed to put them in jail?,” Castro asked. “Most of these executive orders are a lot of rhetoric that’s full of a lot of charged language that’s meant to rally a voting base. It doesn’t have a practical application.” 
Social service providers, who endorse the housing first model, agree that someone having a roof over their head is paramount to helping people address mental health or substance abuse needs.
“We can’t address all these other issues until we get people out of survival mode,” Castro said. “Survival mode means they know where they’re going to sleep tonight.”
Then the challenge is finding a place for them to go when they are ready to move on to permanent supportive housing, Castro said, “because we don’t have anywhere to put them.”
Washoe County alone lacks an estimated 1,100 permanent supportive housing units, said Peters, citing an analysis by the Corporation for Supportive Housing.
In some cases, social services providers are able to successfully get a client qualified for the Housing Choice Vouchers, commonly referred to as Section 8. 
Castro said getting clients a voucher is “half the battle.”
“The other half of the battle is finding somebody who will take it or finding a landlord who will actually accept it,” he said, adding Nevada doesn’t have laws to prohibit landlords from refusing to house people whose rent is paid by federal assistance. 
‘Deaths, I think’
Chamberlain with Northern Nevada HOPES said there has been a growing emphasis in the state for more than a decade to rely on harm reduction tools alongside substance abuse treatment.
The tools, she said, are evidence-based and backed by numerous scientific and health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Trump’s executive order calls for an end to funding for “so-called ‘harm reduction.’”
The Southern Nevada Health District said the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration sent a letter July 29 to agencies clarifying some harm reduction tools still allowed under Trump’s EO.
The list includes fentanyl test strips, HIV treatment, and opioid overdose reversal supplies like naloxone. 
But the letter underscores that no federal funding can be used for“syringes or needles used to inject illicit drugs.”
Clean needles and safe syringes help prevent the spread of other infections, including HIV.
For now, the Southern Nevada Health District doesn’t anticipate “any immediate changes to the harm reduction services” it currently provides. 
“The Health District remains committed to providing harm reduction services and resources to the community,” the district said in an email. “We will continue to monitor federal guidance and policy changes to help ensure the continuity and accessibility of these vital public health services.”
Though there are still many unknowns to the impact of Trump’s order, Chamberlain worries that the order will have a dire impact on unhoused people.
“From a health perspective, it’s going to result in deaths, I think, and significant health care needs that will go untreated because there won’t be access to services.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1_HOPES_Exterior-1024x607-1.jpg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

(Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)The nation is at the cusp of a redistricting arms race, sparked by a rare mid-decade redistricting fight in Texas and fanned by other states like California signaling they’re willing to pause their own independent redistricting rules if Texas Republicans get their way. 
While other states, both red and blue, eye changes to their own congressional maps ahead of 2026 to gain partisan advantages, it’s possible Utah could also be propelled into the national redistricting spotlight — but for reasons that have been years in the making. 
Any day now, a district court judge is expected to rule in a longstanding redistricting lawsuit that has the potential — if the judge sides with plaintiffs — to force the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature to scrap the congressional boundaries it last set in 2021. Before then, one of Utah’s four U.S. House seats was a competitive seat for Democrats. Today, Republicans consistently dominate all four.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

Utah’s ongoing redistricting battle
In the Utah redistricting lawsuit, plaintiffs argue lawmakers violated the Utah Constitution when they repealed and replaced a 2018 voter initiative creating an independent redistricting commission, then used the replacement law to adopt a congressional map that cracked Democratic strongholds. 
The anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries, the group that successfully pursued that 2018 voter initiative known as Proposition 4, has been closely watching Utah’s lawsuit — and is now watching with dismay as Texas, California and other states engage in redistricting wars. 
Elizabeth Rasmussen, who in March replaced Katie Wright as Better Boundaries’ executive director, told Utah News Dispatch on Thursday that she worries Republicans and Democrats are heading toward a point of no return. 
“It’s very disheartening to see that we have national acceptance of just blatantly partisan gerrymandering to gain an advantage,” she said. “It’s obviously something that we’ve been against from the beginning. That’s how we started.” 
She fears the “domino effect” could jeopardize efforts for nonpartisan, fair redistricting processes to represent voters across the country, but also here in Utah. 
“We have Texas, and then we have trigger laws in California that could go into effect for redistricting there to even the playing field, and then it just keeps cascading down,” she said, noting other states including Illinois and New York are now eying their own redistricting plans. 
Will Utah get new congressional maps? Judge hears oral arguments in Utah redistricting case

While Utah, for now, is in a holding pattern while it awaits a court decision, Rasmussen said a ruling could thrust Utah into the redistricting wars, one way or another. 
“We are expecting a ruling any day now,” she said. “So I don’t know when that will happen, but whenever it does … Utah will be in the spotlight.” 
While Texas Republicans’ mid-decade redistricting effort comes at the prompting of President Donald Trump “purely for partisan advantage,” Rasmussen said, Utah’s (if the judge sides with plaintiffs) would be court-ordered. 
But even if anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs get a favorable ruling in the Utah court case, Rasmussen worries that openly partisan gerrymandering playing out in states like Texas and California could “embolden” the Utah Legislature “to continue to ignore these processes.” 
“If there’s retaliatory redistricting in other states, will that put our independent redistricting commission in jeopardy?” she said. “There’s a lot of possibilities here, but I don’t see many positives from it.” 
Better Boundaries foresees three scenarios that could play out, depending on the judge’s looming decision. One would be a “complete victory” for plaintiffs — if the court reinstates Proposition 4 and orders new congressional maps for 2026. Another, a “partial victory,” would be that the court reinstates Proposition 4 but requires additional proceedings before new maps can be ordered. Or plaintiffs could lose, and the court could side with the Legislature’s authority to repeal voter initiatives. 
Regardless of what happens, more court appeals are likely, whether that’s from state leaders or from the plaintiffs.

And as time goes on, even if plaintiffs get a favorable ruling, the likelihood of new maps being drawn in time for the 2026 election is dwindling. Utah election officials have said in court documents that ahead of next year’s election, boundaries would need to be set by this November. 
“The longer it takes to get a ruling, the more challenging it becomes to get fair maps or these new maps before 2026,” Rasmussen said. “Not impossible, but yeah. It does get more difficult. As we’ve seen through this whole case, things continue to be delayed and take a long time. We prefer (a decision) sooner rather than later.” 
If not 2026, though, it’s possible new maps would be redrawn before the 2028 election. It all depends on what happens next in the lawsuit. 
A Utah Republican congressman opposes mid-decade redistricting
One member of Utah’s all-Rebublican congressional delegation has opposed the mid-decade redistricting efforts playing out in Texas, making him the first member of the U.S. House GOP leadership to speak out against it. Moore is vice chair of the House Republican Conference. 
“I do not agree with state efforts to redistrict mid-decade,” Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, said in a prepared statement, first reported by The Salt Lake Tribune. “It undermines established norms and gives blue states a glaring green light to do the same. Partisan gerrymandering is clearly done by both sides, but to allow this wildfire to spread mid-decade is a step too far.”

Before Moore was first elected to Congress in 2020, Moore helped lead Better Boundaries’ efforts. But in 2021, he supported the Utah Legislature’s redistricting efforts. Then in 2023, he joined Utah’s three other GOP congressmen in writing a brief submitted to the Utah Supreme Court that argued the U.S. Constitution offers no protections against partisan gerrymandering. 
Moore’s office on Thursday did not immediately respond to requests asking about Moore’s current stance on Utah’s redistricting lawsuit and whether he supports the idea of an independent redistricting commission, given his past involvement with Better Boundaries. 
Rasmussen said she agrees with Moore’s comment that mid-decade redistricting is wrong, but she said partisan gerrymandering in general should be opposed more wholeheartedly. 
“I just hope that those who have stood against gerrymandering in the past would continue to stand on that principle,” she said. “I know it’s tempting to fight fire with fire, and it’s hard to fight one side that’s playing with unfair rules, but if we don’t continue to stand up for what the right process is, I don’t see a natural ending point to what’s happening.”

The vote by the Contract Review Committee puts a 45-day hold on the contract between DOC and attorney William Lunsford with Butler Snow LLP to defend the department in a lawsuit brought by the family of an inmate who died by suicide at Donaldson Correctional Facility.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, raised questions about the length of time the case has been litigated and asked Chief Deputy Attorney General Clay Crenshaw about the state’s strategy for ultimately finding a resolution in the matter.

“It appears that if we would have taken every plaintiff across the state, in cases that have sued the Alabama Department of Corrections, and put them in a room and said, ‘How much would it cost to settle these cases if we just gave you a sum right now?’ We probably would have spent infinitely less money than we have on the lawyers on these cases,” England said during the committee meeting.
Sen. Tom Butler, R-Madison, requested the hold after England voiced his concerns.
“I hope to get at the very least, answers about how many cases are pending, how much money we are paying for them, and ultimately, what is the expected resolution,” said England in an interview with media following the meeting. “Are we going to try the case, are we going to settle the case, what?”
The Contract Review Committee has the authority to delay finalizing contracts awarded by government agencies for up to 45 days but cannot compel the executive branch from rescinding them.
According to the agenda, the case is pending, and a new contract is needed so that the Alabama Department of Corrections may retain representation in the case. Crenshaw said the case was previously handled by Butler Snow attorney Matthew B. Reeves, who with Lunsford and attorney William J. Cranford was removed from a lawsuit after Reeves used AI to generate a legal brief that included citations to nonexistent cases.
Crenshaw said Reeves “has been removed from any representation involving ADOC.”
U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco ordered all three removed from the case, referred the matter to the Alabama Bar Association and other licensing agencies and issued a public reprimand.
Lunsford has been awarded millions of dollars in contracts to represent DOC in lawsuits. He was awarded a legal services contract in December for $4.68 million. Lunsford was also awarded a legal services contract for $7.68 million in June 2023.
“I don’t have a problem with that,” said Sen. Dan Roberts, R-Mountain Brook, regarding awarding the contract to Lunsford. “I understand the details of how they got here. A major mistake was made, the court has already dealt with them on that, but he has done a lot of work for the state.”
Members of the Contract Review Committee also awarded a $200,000 contract to attorney H. William Bloom of Maynard Nexsen to represent Gov. Kay Ivey in a lawsuit filed by Kent Davis, the former commissioner of the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs.
Ivey terminated Davis soon after members of the Alabama State Board of Veterans Affairs voted to retain him during a meeting in October, citing broad executive powers. Davis filed an ethics complaint against Kim Boswell, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Mental Health.
Davis then filed a lawsuit in June alleging that he was wrongfully terminated and that Ivey violated his right to constitutional rights, such as free speech and due process.

Last month, the Bureau of Land Management greenlit a proposal by the St. Cloud Mining Company to drill up to 30 boreholes on public lands just north of Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in search of clinoptilolite – a clay-like mineral used in water filtration, odor control, and soil conditioner.
Boreholes would be drilled just a few hundred feet away from the boundary of Ash Meadows, in an area of critical environmental concern that includes habitat for several rare and endemic species found nowhere else in the world.
Despite the project’s location, federal land managers concluded the project would have “no significant impact” on the environment and did not require a more in-depth environmental analysis before being approved.
Now a coalition of four environmental groups – the Center for Biological Diversity, Amargosa Conservancy, Friends of the Amargosa Basin, and the Sierra Clube Toiyabe Chapter – are asking the federal government to halt the drilling project while that decision is reviewed.
“These species and this landscape are direly threatened by mining exploration as proposed by St. Cloud Mining. If the St. Cloud project moves forward, it will cause irreparable harm to lands and waters in and around Ash Meadows and possibly drive these species toward extinction,” wrote Patrick Donnelly in a declaration to the BLM’s California state office.
St. Cloud Mining, which operates an existing mine nearby that was approved in 1987, did not respond to a request for comment.
In a letter to the California BLM director Joseph Stout, the coalition cites the project’s proximity to sensitive wildlife habitat, concerns with surface and groundwater resources and the impact to cultural sites, as reasons for concern. 
The letter, which lays out evidence to support the groups’ request, says the federal government did not adequately analyze the project’s potential impact on wildlife, air quality, or water resources.
California BLM director Stout can affirm the original decision, reverse it completely, or modify it in part. If the request is denied, it can be appealed to the Interior Department’s Board of Land Appeals, or the environmental review could be the subject of a lawsuit.
Drilling will be limited to about one acre of surface area. The company plans to fill them up and replant seeds after exploration is complete. Any further construction would require further environmental review with an opportunity for public comment. 
Federal hydrologists did acknowledge the company’s plan to drill boreholes up to 300 feet deep would likely hit groundwater due to the area’s shallow water table, a major concern for conservation groups. 
Ash Meadows is home to a dozen federally protected species that rely on groundwater dependent springs, meaning any change to groundwater flow could be detrimental to them.
Exploration is typically the least environmentally damaging stage of mining, but even shallow drilling in the Amargosa Basin groundwater system can have severe, unpredictable, and far-reaching impacts.
Borehole Spring in Inyo County, California, near Tecopa Hot Springs, started as an exploratory drill hole dug by the Stauffer Chemical Company for sodium prospecting in 1967. After a driller punctured the aquifer at a depth of 350 feet, the Stauffer Chemical Company attempted to plug the leaking borehole, but steady water pressure kept eroding each successive well seal. A year later the cavity was filled with over 10,000 cubic yards of gravel, but the flow was never completely contained.
“St. Cloud’s proposed exploration project, by their own admission, will intersect groundwater. If their drilling activities cause a perturbation to the groundwater flow system, or worse, hit uncontrolled artesian flow, it could affect springs,” Donnelly wrote. 
Still, federal hydrologists maintained it was unlikely the project would hit a pressurized water zone, adding that the risk of creating an uncontrolled water flow was low. 
The drilling operation will also require somewhere between 20,000 – 40,000 gallons of water to be trucked in from either the Longstreet Inn in Amargosa Valley or Wolfenstein Construction in Pahrump.
Conservation groups noted that Ash Meadows is already threatened by groundwater pumping in the Amargosa Basin, due to water intensive dairy operations and alfalfa farming nearby. Residents of nearby Amargosa Valley have also reported domestic groundwater wells drying up near their homes.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/lower-carson.jpeg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557
,California,2025-08-08 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s stubborn poverty crisis will hamper Newsom’s national climb,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-poverty-hamper-newsom-climb/,"While Newsom is fond of touting California’s immense economic output, he rarely mentions its high rates of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thanks largely to the state's high costs of housing, utilities and other necessities.","Gavin Newsom is pursuing what appears to be an image-building prelude to a 2028 presidential campaign and much of that effort involves appearances on widely popular podcasts.
Those podcasts, such as the one featuring comedian Joe Rogan, are the 2025 equivalents of the radio talk shows and newspaper interviews that ambitious politicians frequented in the past.
Famously, a little-known one-term governor of Georgia named Jimmy Carter burrowed his way into the presidency in 1976 by spending months traipsing around the country with aide Jody Powell, sharing rooms in cheap hotels and seeking interviews by radio DJs and local journalists.
I can attest to that personally. During a state Democratic Party convention in Sacramento, Powell tirelessly peddled interviews with Carter, but to little avail. At the time, Carter was a political nobody, eclipsed by better known rivals at the convention such as former astronaut John Glenn.
Media may have changed but ambitious politicians haven’t. They want to build name recognition to claim places on the unofficial lists of potential candidates maintained by political media, pollsters and potential campaign supporters.
As governor of the nation’s most populous state who portrays himself as a cutting-edge political theorist, Newsom has obvious advantages in seeking more name recognition. However, he also has liabilities, starting with the fact that his state has serious problems that have seen little or no improvement during his governorship.
While Newsom is fond of touting California’s immense economic output, for example, he rarely, if ever, mentions it has high rates of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thanks largely to its extremely high costs of housing, utilities and other necessities of life.
We received another reminder of California’s chronic poverty crisis this week in a report from the Public Policy Institute of California about what happened after the COVID-19 pandemic receded and federal relief programs ended. The PPIC and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality used a way of measuring poverty that takes into account not only income but the cost of living. It’s similar in thrust to the Census Bureau’s alternative way of measuring poverty.
By their California Poverty Index, the PPIC report says, the rate rose from 15.2% in 2022 to 16.9% in 2023, meaning about 6.4 million Californians were living in poverty with Los Angeles County’s 19.9% being the highest of any county.
Even more disturbing is the calculation that when families in near-poverty are counted, 34.8% of Californians were feeling economic distress in 2023, and there’s no reason to believe that the situation has materially improved since then. That number comports with the fact that at least a third of Californians qualify for Medi-Cal, the state health care program for poor people.
The Census Bureau also singles out California in its supplemental calculation of poverty that includes costs of living and other factors left out of the official poverty rate. While California’s official poverty rate of 11.7% over the 2021-23 period is virtually identical to the national rate, its alternative rate, 15.4%, is the highest of any state and markedly higher than those of Texas and Florida, two red states that Newsom often compares to California.
There’s no question that California’s high poverty rate is rooted in its high costs of living because its median household income of $95,921 is the nation’s fifth-highest.
It’s generally accepted that the rising cost of living is one of the major reasons why Donald Trump won last year’s presidential election. While inflation has moderated somewhat in recent months — although it could rise due to Trump’s tariffs — costs of living will probably color the 2028 presidential race as well. That could weigh heavily on Newsom.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/102523-Homeless-LA-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

(Photo: LVGEA)Economic indicators may be pointing toward a downturn, but Nevada’s go-to consultant predicts no “nuclear winter” is coming for Las Vegas and its vaunted tourism industry.
“Overall, the United States is both resilient and resourceful, and so is the State of Nevada, and so is Southern Nevada,” Jeremy Aguero of Applied Analysis told attendees at a Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance event Thursday. “Economic cycles are going to happen. This one is inevitably going to happen.”
Aguero is Nevada’s most high-profile consultant and has been contracted to help create many of the largest economic development projects — and public subsidy packages — in the state’s history, including Allegiant Stadium for the Raiders and the planned Las Vegas Strip baseball stadium for the Athletics. Aguero also worked on the failed 2021 Blockchains LLC initiative to allow private companies to effectively establish their own local governments in Nevada.
His comments Thursday come as Southern Nevada reports six consecutive months of declining visitation and the latest U.S. job report shows a softening of the labor market.
“We’ve been in a period of economic uncertainty for some period of time as we’ve introduced $5.3 trillion worth of stimulus into our economy,” Aguero said, referring to the half dozen fiscal pandemic-aid packages passed since 2020. “Now we’re shocked and stunned that money is not around and it’s a little more difficult on folks.”
He downplayed the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff policy, saying “the risk is certainly there” but adding that tariffs, the vast majority of which went into effect Thursday, have had “almost no particular effect on consumers today.”
Aguero acknowledged “some softness” in the economy and said people “absolutely” have concerns, but “generally speaking, our economy is moving forward.”
He pointed to U.S. gross domestic product, which is at the highest level it’s ever been.
Aguero also noted that employment overall in the U.S. is up.
And he referenced the most recent jobs report, which showed such sluggish job growth in the country over the last three months that President Donald Trump fired the person running the agency that created the report.
“You would have thought the world was somehow going to end,” Aguero said. “I assure you; it is not. Because we are employing more people in the United States than at any point in our history.”
Nevada has one of the highest unemployment rates among states but is “one of a handful of states that has seen a material reduction in its unemployment rate,” Aguero noted.
But wage growth, he said, has outpaced inflation.
“We are increasingly concerned about prices that are rising,” he added. “I would suggest that this has as much to do with perception as it does reality.”
That still presents “a big problem” for the state, he said.
“Consumers feel worse about what is happening in the world today than they did at the peak of the pandemic,” Aguero said. “Consumers are doing fine. They’re scared to death in terms of what comes next.”
Data shows that consumers are concerned and pulling back on discretionary spending. It also shows that consumer debt is up, particularly among those making lower incomes.
Aguero also addressed recent data showing declines in visitor volume, gaming revenue and average daily room rates.
“This has been the expectation for a long time, that there would be at least some of that,” he said. “What we’ve seen is the beginning of that.”
But he praised the state’s tourism sector as being the best in the industry. He predicted it will, as it has in the past, adapt to visitor demographic changes and consumer trends and concerns.
Aguero said that over the past three decades there have been numerous times, including after 9/11 and the Great Recession, when “everybody wants to believe that what we have in front of us is never going to be sustained.”
“We’re going to have some challenges,” he said. “There’s no doubt about it.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/0U7A0614_LVGEA-scaled-e1754657680409-1024x688.jpg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A state judge Monday dismissed a lawsuit from parents of children who are potentially eligible to receive medical cannabis who wanted to force the state to create a patient registry.
Montgomery County Circuit Judge James Anderson wrote in the order that the plaintiffs lacked the legal standing to bring the claim.
The plaintiffs, parents Dustin Chandler, Cristina Cain, Catherine Hall, Megan Jackson and Kari Forsyth, filed a lawsuit in April to direct  “the State of Alabama to uphold the Compassion Act’s requirement that the commission establish a patient and caregiver registry and to secure performance by defendants of this duty owed to the public.”
“The identity of qualified patients and caregivers will not be known, and the patient registry populated, until the (Alabama Board of Medical Examiners) authorizes physicians to identify and recommend medical cannabis and provide the necessary information regarding the qualified patients,” the dismissal order stated.

Anderson in his order also said that plaintiffs weren’t the right party to sue on behalf of the state, and that the lawsuit would have to have “participation or consent of the attorney general of Alabama.”
“Petitioners cannot demonstrate standing to invoke the Court’s jurisdiction because they are not the proper party to institute a proceeding for mandamus in the name of the State in this matter and because they do not have standing to bring a claim individually related to the patient registry,” the order stated.
A message seeking comment was left with the parents’ lawyer.
When will Alabama get medical cannabis? Officials, producers see reasons for hope

John McMillan, director of the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC), said in a phone interview Thursday that he was pleased with the court’s ruling, saying that this lawsuit could have been resolved with “a phone call to our office.”
“Until we get licenses issued in these other categories, (doctors) can’t start certifying patients and putting them in the registry,” McMillan said.
A motion to dismiss filed by AMCC stated that the AMCC had already established a patient registry and was maintaining it. The reason it was not populated, according to the commission, was due to a series of lawsuits filed by “disappointed license applicants” that resulted in delays due to restraining orders and injunctions.
The AMCC argued that those delays prevented them from issuing licenses, which is a prerequisite for the Board of Medical Examiners (BME) to certify physicians. Without certified physicians, patients cannot be registered.
The BME is responsible for certifying physicians to recommend medical cannabis, and physician certifications can only be issued after the AMCC has granted at least one license to a cultivator, processor, transporter and dispensary, or one integrated facility.
The petitioners’ response to the motion to dismiss countered that the commission’s website “expressively contradicts” their claim of a functioning registry, and that “the hold up with the medical board’s requirement is on the Commission.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PXL_20231010_1945220872-1024x729.jpg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

Santiago/Getty Images)Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.
But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/court-arrests.jpg,,,2025-08-08 09:56:12.021557

Michigan’s Judicial Tenure commission is a nine member board tasked with investigating complaints and potential misconduct from judges. While the body cannot impose sanctions or discipline judges, they can take confidential action by issuing a letter of explanation, admonition or caution, or recommend a public complaint, including sanctions like suspension or dismissal.
In 2023, the Association of Black Judges of Michigan announced it was seeking an independent audit of the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission, noting that 52% of the judges charged by the commission between 2008 and 2022 were Black, while 48% were white. This request was supported by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, who noted the “confidentiality of the Commission’s records and the general inaccessibility of the body’s proceedings make it difficult for concerned individuals and organizations like ours to verify or investigate the allegations that we receive.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The State Court Administrative Office and the commission in 2024 contracted with the National Center for State Courts to produce a racial equity analysis of how the Judicial Tenure Commission reviews grievances, releasing Phase I of its analysis in 2024. 
The initial review pointed to several disparities. Black judicial officers faced a significantly higher number of grievances on average than white officers, grievances against Black judicial officers were more likely to proceed into a full investigation and Black officers were more likely than white officers to have a grievance resolved in public censure. 
In light of these findings, Phase II of the analysis set out to look at the factors that could result in the disparities between outcomes. 
While the analysis found that members of the commission believed their process to be fair, without bias and based on clear standards of conduct, responding judges and their attorneys did not agree. Interviews conducted as part of the analysis found individuals on the receiving end of a complaint “largely thought that the process was not clearly communicated and options for a negotiated resolution were not equally available or known to everyone.”
The analysis notes that Black judges responding to a complaint were the most likely to state in their interviews that the complaint process is racially biased. 
Further analysis found that Black respondents were 57% more likely to see a grievance escalate into a full investigation when additional evidence gathering is approved, even if that request is only for a transcript of court proceedings. However, when requests for transcripts were omitted, race was not a statistically significant factor in determining if a grievance would escalate. 
When considering the severity of a grievance’s outcome, Black respondents were also more likely to receive a public outcome than to have a grievance dismissed or dismissed with a confidential discussion. Men were also more likely to face more severe sanctions. 
However, further analysis found there was not a statistically significant relationship between race and severity when cases included individuals who were likely to receive a public sanction, but left the position before receiving a final outcome. 
In reviewing their findings, the National Center for State Courts concluded there must be some mechanism tied to the inclusion of a transcript in the initial request for investigation or the transcript evidence-gathering recommendation or approval process that contributes to the relationship between race and a grievance proceeding to full investigation.
The report suggested that grievants could be less likely to include transcripts in requests for investigation filed against Black respondents, requiring them to be requested. 
It’s also possible that the commission is more likely to request — or the commissioners are more likely to approve — transcript-only requests for Black respondents, the report noted, recommending further data collection and analysis to help pinpoint contributing factors. 
“While nothing in the qualitative or quantitative analysis suggests explicit discriminatory practices by the JTC, the apparent lack of standardized definitions, criteria, and processes contributes to real or perceived unfair treatment based on race,” the report noted.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 07:56:35.052400

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, along with a bipartisan coalition of 49 other attorneys general, requested that the U.S. Department of Justice assist in their efforts to address what they described as a “rampant spread of illegal offshore gaming operations” across the country.
In a letter addressed to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Brown and his counterparts said that illegal online sports betting and gaming operations, widely run by foreign-based companies, could be harming residents in all 50 states, since they “routinely operate without proper licensure, offer limited or non-existent consumer protections, fail to verify user age, ignore state boundaries, and evade taxation obligations.”
The volume of illegal online gaming has exceeded $400 billion a year, the National Association of Attorneys General estimates — and over $4 billion in lost tax revenue for states.

“Since 2013, USDOJ enforcement actions against illegal offshore gambling sites have been extremely limited,” the attorneys wrote. “We seek USDOJ’s cooperation and coordination to deploy robust legal tools to curb these unlawful enterprises.”

The Department of Justice is allowed to seize assets like servers, domains and proceeds that violate federal law, the letter says, an authority the department has used in at least two other fraud cases.
Additionally, the attorneys suggested the department work with major payment processors to cut off the companies’ access to the U.S. financial system.
“Both Visa and Mastercard have already signaled their willingness to investigate and address unlawful use of their networks for gambling transactions,” the letter says. “We should capitalize on this willingness to shut down illegal offshore gaming operations.”
The activity exposes vulnerable people to fraud and addictive gambling without oversight or accountability, the attorneys wrote, and has been linked to other serious crimes.
“Illegal offshore gaming operations are a breeding ground for criminal behavior, such as money laundering and human trafficking. These companies routinely flaunt Utah laws and put Utah consumers at risk,” Brown said in a statement. “Together we can take action against these foreign-based operations that wreak havoc on our communities, foster gambling addictions, and harm Utah consumers.”

Police showed up to his home with guns drawn in what is known as a “swatting” incident. Not long after, the FBI was told a bomb was at his family’s home. That wasn’t true, either.
Coughenour, a U.S. District Court judge in Seattle, shared those experiences during a public forum last week. The incidents are emblematic of the ways judges have increasingly come under attack in the Trump era, as they often block his controversial policies. 
In the early days of President Donald Trump’s second term, Coughenour, who was appointed to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan, had called Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship “blatantly unconstitutional.” He was the first judge in the nation to rule against a Trump policy this year. 
Other federal judges joined Coughenour in speaking out at last week’s event. They described attacks on the rule of law as the Trump administration has flouted some court rulings and the president has criticized judges by name.

Judges don’t often publicly discuss issues that could be perceived as partisan out of fear of showing bias.
“I signed up for this and I’ll endure the threats and attempts to intimidate, but my family didn’t,” Coughenour said. “What kind of people do these things? It’s just so disgusting.”
The nonpartisan judicial advocacy organization Speak Up for Justice organized the panel discussion. Such threats against federal judges have been on the rise for years, but have accelerated in the months since Trump retook office. 
A Rhode Island judge shared a voicemail his office received calling for his assassination. Others said the killing of a judge’s son in New Jersey by a disgruntled lawyer had been invoked to intimidate other judges across the country.
Judge Robert Lasnik, who President Bill Clinton appointed to the federal bench in Seattle, said he was one of the many who received an unsolicited pizza delivery mentioning Daniel Anderl, who was murdered in 2020 and is the son of Judge Esther Salas. Two of Lasnik’s adult children also got similar suspicious pizza deliveries to their homes. 
The harassment came after he spoke about Trump’s rhetoric on the judiciary with KUOW, a local NPR affiliate in Seattle. 
The message Lasnik said he took from this was “we know where you live, we know where your children live, and they could end up dead, like Judge Salas’s son.”
As a senior judge, Lasnik opted out of cases involving the Trump administration so he could feel free to speak about attacks on the rule of law.
“I saw it from my colleagues, some of whom have only been on the bench for two or three years,” he added. “They would make a ruling, they would be bombarded with hate mail and hate emails and threats. And it’s so discouraging to a young judge to suddenly not only worry about, how do I do this job right, but how do I keep my family safe?”
The Trump administration’s moves to block gender-affirming care for transgender youth, withhold federal funding and bar refugees are among the issues that have ended up before judges in Washington state.
Coughenour recalled helping Russian judges to develop an independent judiciary after the fall of the Soviet Union. Those judges looked at the U.S. justice system with reverence. That reputation has now been damaged, he said.
He reminded the audience that attacks on the rule of law and judicial independence preceded the rise to power for Nazis in 1930s Germany and Pol Pot in 1970s Cambodia. He said the United States needs a call to action: “Not in this country. Not on our watch.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 07:56:35.052400

(Niki Kelly for the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette)“Surreal” is the only way to describe a gaggle of Hoosier reporters gathering around a speakerphone to record a gruff voice beaming in from Illinois. But that’s what happened in 2011, when Indiana House Democrats staged a walkout to block a variety of bills.
The memories of those peculiar media availabilities with Rep. Pat Bauer, D-South Bend, came flooding back when I heard Texas Democrats had also fled the state — this time to block a mid-cycle redistricting.
The nearly six-week Hoosier walkout likely led to a GOP supermajority and has had lasting negative impacts to this day.
House Democrats left Indiana on Feb. 22, 2011, for a Comfort Suites in Urbana, Illinois. The caucus was fighting several anti-union bills, though a host of other issues also played a role, including state-funded vouchers for private schools.
Their absence meant the House couldn’t put together a quorum to conduct business. Dozens of bills died on the calendar during the walkout.
The absent members were fined tens of thousands of dollars, but they held off right-to-work legislation for a year and got other, smaller concessions.
Was it worth it? Definitely not.
What’s happening now
The Texas fiasco is happening on a much bigger stage and centers on one issue that is relatively simple to explain to voters: should Texas Republicans redraw congressional districts early — instead of after the 2030 census — to create more GOP seats and help the party hold a narrow U.S. House margin?
Given the higher profile and tighter focus, the impact of the Texas Democrats’ walkout could be more effective.
Indiana lawmakers might face a similar situation soon as pressure mounts from President Donald Trump’s administration for other red states to redistrict early. But Democrats won’t have the option of a walkout this time.
That’s because the GOP controls the House 70-30 and the Senate 40-10. It takes a quorum of 67 and 33 to conduct business, respectively, which means Republicans don’t need Democrats for a quorum or to pass a bill.
Indiana Republicans have a big decision to make.
They have to weigh public transparency and fiscal prudence in deciding whether to redistrict in a special session. Gov. Mike Braun, in particular, has spent months preaching financial discipline — resulting in state layoffs as well as cuts to benefits and services for Hoosiers.
The decision to call a special session is ultimately up to Braun, but legislative leaders would have to be on board to avoid embarrassment.
The GOP would need to find a cogent message on why the move is necessary. After all, Indiana’s population has increased minimally, about 1.5%, since 2021, so there simply aren’t large migration and demographic changes to adjust for.
What’s left is purely partisan politics. And it’s hard for me to to believe that the GOP leaders here would move forward with a special, superfluous session that could cost upwards of $200,000 just for that.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s state agencies are slowly earning approval for their plans to save money after being hit with effective 10% spending cuts amid a tough budget cycle.
A grim May revenue forecast prompted lawmakers to cut most agency appropriations by 5% in the latest biennial budget — and authorize the State Budget Agency to withhold another 5%.
Agencies were forced to describe how they’ll meet that target in “strategic spending reduction plans” due at the end of June. The first batch of plans got the green light last week.
The Indiana Criminal Justice Institute plans to conduct monthly reviews of spending — with any “deviations” to be “flagged, investigated, and addressed,” Executive Director Douglas Huntsinger and Chief Financial Officer Sheryll Espinas wrote to Ranney.
Some agencies took aim at their contracts.

The Indiana Department of Administration expects to save upwards of $2 million with the elimination of consulting and software contracts identified in a six-month “deep dive.”
“IDOA will take a robust look at any new contract or expense to make sure we will stay within our spending plan before locking ourselves into any new commitments,” Commissioner Brandon Clifton wrote.
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith’s office conserved more than $650,000 by discontinuing agreements, according to its submission. It renegotiated another to save $15,000.
The Indiana State Department of Agriculture, which Beckwith oversees, let a contract with law firm Barnes & Thornburg expire, instead hiring a general counsel and leaning on Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office when needed. It stopped advertising in an agricultural magazine and worked with the Indiana State Fair to store equipment rather than paying for private storage, per its plan.
The agency was among those that cut jobs.
It got rid of six vacant positions instead of filling them, and is limiting travel for remaining staff. That includes events, conferences and trade missions. It also dropped a subscription to policy monitoring tool Politico Pro.
Beckwith also oversees the Office of Community and Rural Affairs, which described eliminating four positions and instituting travel limits. Non-critical technology and equipment upgrades are on hold.
The Indiana Destination Development Corporation saw one of the largest cuts — 85% of its budget. As a result it laid off three employees and didn’t rehire five open positions, according to CEO Amy Howell’s plan. The director of the Lincoln Amphitheatre will be paid out of an account dedicated to the historic site instead of the agency’s main fund.
Some savings will come at the expense of others.
The Indiana Department of Administration will pass on the cost of running the state’s conference center streaming services to its peers.
“As opposed to IDOA shouldering these expenses, we will charge agencies a fee,” Clifton wrote.
50+ state employees laid off as Indiana budget cuts take effect

His plan also noted the agency is no longer obligated to cover about $1 million in maintenance and operational costs annually for the Indiana Historical Society. The change, made in the budget, originally came with language that would’ve forced the institution out of its building.
More switch-ups are on the way — but may require legislative help.
Establishing a statutory cap on forensic medical exam reimbursement could save the state $1 million or $2 million, according to the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute.
The lack of a cap means medical providers are submitting charges at “significant(ly) varying amounts,” according to the agency’s plan. It’s working on a study to “establish a sustainable reimbursement framework that continues to support victims of sexual assault while producing greater predictability and cost stability for the state.”
Agencies were also asked to describe anticipated procurement and capital expenditures — which could get pricey for the institute. It needs a new Victim Compensation Claim System during this fiscal year, which began July 1.
Despite warning that the 5% reserve amounts were “unlikely to be released,” the State Budget Agency did approve plans with exemption requests.
Institute funds for victims of violent crime and domestic violence were spared, for instance.
Notably, the Indiana Election Division requested a wholesale exemption.
“We are very sensitive to the rising costs of providing public services and the case of elections is no exception. Since 2016, the cost of administering elections has skyrocketed due to cyber and physical security threats,” bipartisan Co-Directors Bradley King and Angela Nussmeyer wrote.
Lawsuits have also hit the agency hard.
A recent Indiana Supreme Court ruling will cost an estimated $145,000, while a separate federal ruling will require it to pay more than $100,000 per fiscal year to provide specialized software to certain voters, according to the duo.
The agency has still cut other costs by more than 10%, King and Nussmeyer assured Ranney.

As part of Operation Robocall Roundup, the attorneys general are sending warning letters to 37 voice service providers, which transmit the calls, demanding they stop illegal robocalls from being routed through telecom networks. They also sent letters to nearly 100 downstream providers that accept call traffic from those other providers to inform them that they are doing business with bad actors.
“Who isn’t fed up with scam calls!? We all get them multiple times daily. Enough is enough,” New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said Thursday. “Our bipartisan coalition is cracking down on telecom companies enabling scammers to flood us with junk calls.”
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey in a statement said the warning letters are the first step in holding those businesses accountable to prevent would-be scammers from using state networks.
According to Fey’s office, the notified voice providers have not complied with Federal Communications Commission rules about responding to traceback requests nor have they registered in the robocall mitigation databases. The providers also have not filed a plan to reduce illegal robocalls on their network.
“By disregarding these simple rules, these companies are allowing robocallers onto their phone networks and then passing their calls on to other downstream providers until they reach the phones of Maine people,” the office said.
These efforts from the 51 attorneys general, including the District of Columbia, are part of the anti-robocall litigation task force that formed in 2022. The task force investigates and takes legal action against companies responsible for significant volumes of illegal and fraudulent robocalls across the country.

“This isn’t some one-off miracle infrastructure. The partnerships, the blueprint — it can scale, and it should scale,” said Aimée Green, executive director of Jenna's Promise.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  In Johnson, a holistic addiction treatment organization turns five, eyes expansion.","The five year anniversary celebration of Jenna’s Promise was held at Jenna’s House in Johnson. Photo by Gordon Miller/News & Citizen 
This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Aug. 7.
“We started basically something new and innovative, honestly without really knowing what the heck we were doing at that time, but we kept our eyes open and our ears open, listening to people that had some experience, that could see what we were doing.”
With this remark, Greg Tatro articulated the spirit behind Jenna’s Promise — the addiction treatment organization he and his family founded five years ago after the opioid-related death of his daughter, for whom the organization is named — and alluded to the source of its success.
Outside the former Johnson church the organization converted into a community center four years ago, Tatro was flanked by Jenna’s Promise staff, a bipartisan coalition of supportive politicians, and his family — wife Dawn, son Gregory and daughter-in-law Amy.
The genesis of Jenna’s Promise is a story the family has told many times. Jenna Tatro, in the throes of opioid dependency, in and out of rehabilitation homes, had a seed of a dream to build a program that would work for her and others, before she succumbed to her substance-use disorder in 2019.
That dream, to open a sober home “with a little more substance,” as Greg Tatro put it, began with the Rae of Hope sober home and, in the span of just a few challenging years, shot up, like the organization’s symbolic sunflower, to forever alter their family, the Johnson community and opioid treatment efforts in Vermont.
The Tatros brought in experts like Dan Franklin, who now leads the Vermont Association for Mental Health and Addiction Recovery, and developed a trauma-focused, holistic approach to treating addiction that afforded residents the opportunity to stay far longer than the typical two-week timeframe at other treatment centers.
They melded this holism with a novel village recovery model, bringing together the Tatro family’s business acumen forged in its construction business, G.W. Tatro, to address the underlying material conditions that trap many in the cycle of addiction, by helping them build up their resumes at two Johnson staples — JP’s Promising Goods and Jenna’s Coffee House.

These vertically integrated businesses — which also includes a coffee roasting company — didn’t just provide a leg up for those trying to work their way out of addiction and produce revenue for the organization. They also helped revitalize the village of Johnson, even after the flood of July 2023 put others out of business permanently.
“Johnson is a safer place now than it was,” Tatro said. “A lot of the people that were pushing things are gone. They don’t want to be here when there’s so much recovery going on.”
Last year, Greg and Dawn stepped down from leadership roles on the Jenna’s Promise board of directors, though Greg is still involved in the day-to-day operations of the businesses, and Dawn continues her work helping “more people get into rehab in the last couple of years than anybody else in the state,” according to her husband.
Part of the transition away from a mom-and-pop addiction rehabilitation organization includes bringing on Aimée Green as its new executive last fall. With her background in health care administration in behavioral and psychiatric work, she’s been working to bottle Jenna’s Promise recovery magic and codify its practices to prepare the village recovery model for further expansion.
“This isn’t some one-off miracle infrastructure. The partnerships, the blueprint — it can scale, and it should scale,” Green said on Saturday. “Communities across the country are fighting the same battles against addiction, isolation and economic decline, and Jenna’s promise is proof that we don’t have to choose between compassion and practicality.”

Recovery numbers
A report published by the Vermont Department of Health, Division of Substance Use Programs, which funds Jenna’s Promise operations along with private philanthropic efforts, looked at “phase one” of Jenna’s Promise and how it operated in fiscal years 2023 and 2024.
During those two years, the organization served an average of 31 people per year across three different sober homes. Of those who left the program, 47% were considered “successful program completions,” a number much higher than the national average, according to Gregory Tatro.
The report noted the most common reason for early departure from the program is a return to substance use.
This work comes at a cost, however, which the health department estimated is five times that of other state-funded recovery programs. But the uniqueness of the Jenna’s Promise model might make direct comparisons difficult. According to the report, it costs Vermont Foundations for Recovery in Essex Junction about $10,000 per bed, while Jenna’s Promise costs over $68,000 per bed.
Nonetheless, the Jenna’s Promise business network generated $56,000 in revenue for the organization in 2024, Green said, though the organization has struggled with staff retention over the past few years, according to its phase one report, especially in the wake of the floods which hit Johnson hard.
Partners who have worked with the organization over the past years reported satisfaction with the responsiveness to problems that may have arisen in the partnership. A minority of respondents shared concerns about a “lack of operating procedures,” an issue that Green has specifically worked to rectify.
“I like to use the term ‘bake.’ Let’s fully bake the model,” she said. “Let’s ensure we have all of our processes, systems, policies, procedures — all that stuff — fully in place, so that when we do expand, whether on this footprint or to other communities, we can share that.”

New horizons
The Vermont Department of Corrections already refers many women to the program, where, as Gregory Tatro said, they’re able to address the root causes of their anti-social behavior for a fraction of the cost of incarcerating them.
Green hopes the organization can expand its bed count with a new sober home right on the hill near Jenna’s House. She is also eager to bring the Jenna’s Promise to other towns, and perhaps even Vermont’s population centers.
The week prior to celebrating their five-year anniversary, Green and other members of Jenna’s Promise — along with state officials — met with One Brattleboro, a municipal leadership group working to address the challenges presented by, among other factors, substance-use disorder.
“Brattleboro is a great little place to visit, but there’s a lot of need,” Green said.
The organization continues to garner attention and praise at the state and federal level, thanks in part to Gregory Tatro’s agnostic interest in presidential politics, which has garnered Jenna’s Promise rare bipartisan praise. Tatro will quote a conversation with Republican Chris Christie in one instance and talk about his relationship with New Jersey Democrat Corey Booker in another. Saturday’s anniversary featured speeches from state lawmakers like Rep. Jed Lipsky, I-Stowe; Lt. Gov. John Rogers, R-Glover; and a keynote speech from Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Shelburne, the Senate majority leader.
While some current federal policy may seem to directly inhibit the work the organization is trying to do, Jenna’s Promise aims to begin accepting Medicaid insurance just as severe cuts to the program were mandated in the federal budget. Tatro believes his big tent approach can help people of all political stripes see the value in funding harm reduction.
It’s this willingness to help anyone and everyone see the Jenna’s Promise vision that both Green and Tatro believe will be key to growing one sunflower into a field.
“(My parents) helped blaze the trail,” Gregory Tatro said. “Now, it’s our job to put the pavement down, put the road markings and the guardrails up and the signs.”

The report, which aims to evaluate all 50 states on a series of criteria, points to required Holocaust education in public schools, the establishment of the Holocaust Education and Awareness Commission and a 2020 prohibition on public entities contracting with companies engaging in boycotts of Israel as key areas of progress in Missouri. 
And this year, the legislature established the “Missouri Task Force on Nonprofit Safety and Security,” which will be responsible for studying and making recommendations on the security needs of nonprofit organizations at elevated risk of terrorist attacks. It also created a fund designed to help eligible nonprofits cover the costs of security enhancements. 
Jordan Kadosh, director of the Missouri-based ADL Heartland, called the task force “critical in the fight against antisemitism.”
The report comes as the ADL says there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Missouri over the last two years since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas in Israel that resulted in 1,200 civilian deaths. 
The attack started a war between Israel and Hamas militants that, according to Palestinian health authorities, has killed more than 60,000 people in Gaza, with nearly a third of the dead under the age of 18. Israel now faces growing international condemnation over conditions in Gaza, where the U.N. says there is mounting evidence of famine and widespread starvation.
 
Missouri House advances bill targeting antisemitism despite free-speech concerns

Missouri is home to approximately 59,600 Jewish residents, representing 1% of the state’s total population. 
While the ADL says Missouri has made progress, according to its criteria, there are areas the group hopes lawmakers will address when they return to session in January. 
Atop the list is legislation debated this year that would require the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and Department of Higher Education to assign a staff member to monitor “antisemetic discrimination and harassment” and investigate whether schools have responsibility for incidents. 
The bill would also encourage schools to teach pieces of Jewish-American heritage.
Though it passed the Missouri House, it failed to garner traction in the Senate. 
And it faced criticism over its use of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism. 
Though the definition has been adopted by a majority of U.S. states and included in orders at the federal level, the lead drafter of the definition has spoken against its application “as a tool to target or chill speech on a college campus.”
The bill also included a list of possible examples of antisemitism, most notably “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.” Critics argued the bill was an attempt to silence any critique of Israel’s actions in Gaza on college campuses.
During House debate, the bill’s lead sponsor pushed back on that criticism. 
“The bill is intended to keep the Jewish students safe on campus,” state Rep. George Hruza, a Republican from Huntleigh, said in April. “It really is not taking sides or some kind of position on the conflict in the Middle East.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230307_134403-scaled-e1715095565131-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-08 07:56:35.052400

At U.S. President Donald Trump’s request, Congress voted in July 2025 to claw back $1.1 billion it had previously approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
That measure, which passed in the House and the Senate by very narrow margins, will cut off all federal tax dollars that would have otherwise flowed to PBS and its affiliated TV stations for the next two fiscal years.
The public media network has played a crucial role in producing educational TV programs, especially for children, for nearly 60 years. It has been getting 15% of its budget in recent years from the federal government. Many of its affiliate stations are far more reliant on Washington than that – leading to a flurry of announcements regarding planned program cuts.
“Sesame Street” is still in production, joined by newer TV shows like “Wild Kratts” and “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood.” PBS KIDS, in addition to producing popular age-appropriate programs, has a website and multiple apps with games and activities that provide other opportunities for learning.
Local PBS affiliate stations offer educational programming and other resources for schools, families and communities.
I’m a child development researcher studying how kids engage with digital media and how educational programming and other kinds of content help them learn. I also have two children under 5, so I’m now immersed in children’s media both at work and at home.
 What kids watch

In a study about the kinds of media kids consume that the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology published in June 2025, my colleagues and I surveyed the parents and other kinds of caregivers of 346 first graders. The study participants listed the TV shows, videos, apps and games the kids used the most.
Our research team then used a systematic coding process to look at how much children access educational programming in their favorite media – whether it’s through their favorite TV shows, web videos or video games.
We found that only 12% of this content could be described as educational. This amount varied widely: For some children, according to the adults we surveyed, educational media comprised their top three to five sources. Others listed no educational media consumption at all.
We also looked into who is taking advantage of educational media.
Our team found no differences in kids’ educational media use according to how many years of education their parents had. That finding suggests that kids of all backgrounds are equally likely to consume it.
 The Role of PBS

This peer-reviewed study didn’t break down our results by specific media outlets. But in light of the cessation of federal funding, I wanted to find out how much of the educational content that children watch comes from PBS.
By revisiting our data with this objective in mind, I learned that PBS accounted for 45% of the educational TV or videos parents said their kids watched most often. This makes PBS the top source for children’s educational programming by far. Nickelodeon/Nick Jr. was in second place with 14%, and YouTube, at 9%, came in third.
PBS accounted for a smaller portion, just 6%, of all educational apps and games. I believe that could be because a few non-PBS apps, like Prodigy and i-Ready, which can be introduced in school, dominate this category.
 An uncertain future

Independent production companies collaborating on programming with PBS consult experts in child development and children’s media and conduct research throughout the production process to see how children respond and learn, often in partnership with PBS KIDS.
This rigorous production process can include observing children watching the show, conducting focus groups and surveying parents about their experiences. It requires a lot of time and money to produce this kind of thoughtfully crafted educational media. This process ensures that the programming is both fun for children and helps them learn.
What the end of federal funding will mean for PBS’ educational programming for kids is still unclear. But to me, it seems inevitable that my children – and everyone else’s kids – will have fewer research-informed and freely accessible options for years to come.
At the same time, there will likely be no shortage of flashy and shallow content marketed to kids that offers little of value for their learning.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)State Sen. Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) and Rep. Jenna Jacobson joined Wisconsin Farmers Union President Darin Von Ruden on his Vernon County farm Thursday to criticize the economic and agricultural policies of President Donald Trump as bad for Wisconsin’s small and medium farms. 
The event at the farm in Westby came as Wisconsin Republicans have ignored or disputed the cumulative effect on farmers of tariffs on foreign imports, cuts to programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and an immigration policy that has scared away some farm laborers who are afraid to show up to work. 
“The tariffs coming out of Washington D.C. are hurting our farmers across Wisconsin and across the country, and you don’t have to just take this from me,” Pfaff said. “All you have to do is look at the economic indicators, those troubling signs that are coming across from Washington, D.C. Job growth is stagnating, prices are rising, and the agriculture sector is taking a hit. Sadly, my Republican colleagues in Madison seem to be turning a blind eye to all of these concerns.”

Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), whom Jacobson is challenging in next year’s midterm elections, recently said that “farmers aren’t concerned” about the potential damage of Trump’s policies. At a telephone town hall earlier this week, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said that through actions such as raising the estate tax exemption for farms and the establishment of trade agreements with countries around the world, Wisconsin farmers will be able to benefit from “free markets.” 
But Von Ruden told the Wisconsin Examiner he doesn’t see how Wisconsin’s farmers can benefit when the federal government is cutting programs that directly help them find markets for their products while tariffs only make it harder to export. Trump and Republicans have made massive cuts to USDA programs that help schools and food banks buy food from local farmers. The recently enacted Republican reconciliation law makes large cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, which low-income residents have been able to use to buy food from producers at local farmer’s markets. 
“That’s hundreds of millions of dollars that farmers are going to lose because the government’s not going to be purchasing [food] to take care of the most needy people in this country,” Von Ruden said. “The other thing is, because we’ve allowed so many loopholes in the USDA, fewer people are getting bigger dollars from the government or insurance subsidies and things like that. So that’s taking money away from the small producers, because we don’t have the capabilities to hire an attorney to make sure that we get that $5 or $6 million check from Uncle Sam. Our members and myself, I would much rather get my income from the marketplace versus depending on a government check.”
Von Ruden’s kids are the fourth generation to work on his family farm. He said that with Trump’s tariffs, his costs are going up. Canadian fertilizer is more expensive. The John Deere tractor he uses will soon be unaffordable. 
“We need to make sure that we’re growing agriculture, not decreasing it. Looking at how tariffs are going to affect this farm, we’re going to see the trickle down effect from that in the commodity markets,” Von Ruden said. That trickle down effect is the biggest concern for farmers, he added. 
“The president has said that he’s going to make sure that farmers are taken care of,” Von Ruden said. “Tariffs aren’t going to do that. So let’s stop all the rhetoric.”

Jacobson pointed to a number of proposals in the Wisconsin Legislature meant to help farmers respond to Trump’s trade wars that Republicans have blocked. 
“Wisconsin Republicans had three chances to support our farmers, and three times they voted no,” she said. “Howard Marklein and Republicans in both chambers have failed to support our family farmers, failed to invest in our agricultural industry and made it harder for those in need to buy food. This is completely unacceptable.” 
The driftless region of western Wisconsin is set to become a major target for Democrats in next year’s midterm elections as the effects of Trump administration and Republican policies hit the purple swing region. In addition to Jacobson’s challenge of Marklein, Democrats are targeting U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden’s 3rd Congressional District seat.

But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.










The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.


– Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute


After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.
“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
Tax credits axed
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.
“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
Slower, costlier transition
Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.
According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

The issue involves a new ruling in a lawsuit filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court for the District of Montana. This week, conservationists told the Idaho Capital Sun they filed the lawsuit seeking additional protections for wolves in part because of the expansion of wolf hunting and trapping in states like Idaho.
In 2021, the Idaho Legislature passed, and Gov. Brad Little signed into law, Senate Bill 1211, which eliminated limits on the number of wolf tags hunters could purchase every year, allowed the state to enter into contracts with other government agencies and third parties to kill wolves and legalized trapping on private land year round. 
Wolves are a native species that were nearly driven to extinction in the Western U.S. by the 1930s following a campaign of government bounties and widespread poisoning. 
Recovery took decades. Wolves were one of the first animals added to the Endangered Species List in 1974. Then, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996 using wolves captured in Canada, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
But in 2011, the U.S. Congress removed wolves in Idaho, Montana and parts of other Western states from the Endangered Species Act, setting the stage for hunting, trapping and state management of wolves.
 Judge’s ruling in lawsuit is ‘a huge victory for wolves’ and science, conservationists say

Conservationists said they filed the new lawsuit because they worried wolves are once again in danger of being driven to dangerously low population levels.

“States represent they want to maintain a smaller population of wolves,” Western Watersheds Project Idaho Director Greg LeDonne said in a phone interview. “The concern raised in comments the plaintiffs submitted and in this case is that low populations put wolves at risk of being extirpated again, driven to extinction in the West, and put back in the same position.”
On Tuesday, Montana Fourth District Judge Donald Molloy ruled in favor of the conservationists and tossed out a decision from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that found wolves in the Western United States do not qualify for Endangered Species Act protections.
“It’s a huge victory for wolves, for science and fact and for the many organizations and individuals who worked on this for literally decades in some cases,” Patrick Kelly, the Montana and Washington director for Western Watersheds Project, said in a phone interview.
Although the ruling itself does not change the status or protections of wolves in Idaho, one of the lead attorneys on the case said the ruling is a clear victory for wolves and conservationists. 
“Judge Molloy wholly rejected nearly every argument put forth by the Fish and Wildlife Service in their briefs and oral arguments,” Kate Schultz, senior attorney for the Center for a Humane Economy and a lead counsel in the case, said in a written statement. “This decision was a thorough repudiation of the agency’s handling of wolves, and it is a continuation of a long pattern of cases in which courts have found that the federal government has violated federal law and failed to properly protect wolves in the United States.”
Several plaintiffs said they hope the ruling represents a step toward adding additional protections for wolves and allowing wolves to recover to the point they return to playing their original, natural role in ecosystems. 
 Idaho Department Fish and Game and Gov. Brad Little’s spokesperson disagree with new wolf ruling

Idaho Department of Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks and Gov. Little’s spokeswoman disagreed with the ruling and said the courts should stay out of local wolf management decisions.
﻿
“We’re extremely disappointed with the decision considering Idaho has managed a wolf population above federal recovery goals for decades and sustained more-than-adequate wolf populations since Congress removed them from Endangered Species Act protection in 2011,” Fredericks said in a written statement.
Fish and Game officials said Idaho’s most recent wolf population estimate for May 2024 is 1,235 wolves, which they said is above the recovery goal of 150 wolves.
Little’s office also disagreed with the ruling and called Molloy an activist judge.
“This ruling is yet another example of an activist judge using the Endangered Species Act to harm Western states,” Press Secretary Joan Varsek said in a written statement late Wednesday. “While Congress and the Trump administration work on necessary reforms to the ESA, we are doubling down and reaffirming that state management of wolves has worked for this recovered population. Idaho is and will continue to be a leader in these efforts.”
Although wolves’ status in Idaho did not change with the ruling, Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials said Thursday morning the case and its fallout could potentially lead to changes for wolves in Idaho.
“Idaho could eventually be affected because the court case involves the (Endangered Species Act) status of wolves across the Western U.S. where there’s a mix of federally protected wolves – and federally unprotected wolves – depending on which state they’re in,” Fish and Game officials wrote in a press release. 
“We monitor wolves and continue to manage them in accordance with our management plan to ensure the population exceeds federal recovery criteria while staying within the ecological and social carrying capacity of Idaho,” Fredericks said in a written statement. “Wolves are polarizing, and some people simply don’t believe wolves should be hunted or trapped at all. Where we have sustainable populations, we believe those decisions should be left to the states, and not dictated by the federal government or the courts.”
 What led to the lawsuit seeking protections for wolves in the West?

The case originated from the Western Watersheds Project and several other conservation groups filing a lawsuit in January. 
Conservationists filed the lawsuit after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rejected their petition to provide protections for wolves after states including Idaho worked to decrease the wolf population by expanding wolf hunting and trapping, by eliminating the limit on wolf tags hunters could purchase and by allowing the state to enter into contracts with government agencies and third parties to kill wolves. 
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

“If you look at Idaho Code, in 2011 the Idaho Legislature declared a disaster emergency concerning wolves, and that sort of anti-wolf hysteria or even paranoia has driven Idaho’s policies since that point,” LeDonne of the Western Watersheds Project said in a phone interview. “It’s become progressively more anti-wolf, and it’s really seeking to drive the population down to an unsustainable level.”
Kelly, who is also with Western Watersheds Project, said state governments are resurrecting some of the tools and policies that originally led to killing off wolves in the West. 
“One big indication is that Idaho and now Montana have instituted bounty systems where private individuals get reimbursed for killing wolves,” Kelly said. “That is a practice from the 1800s that has been resurrected – driven by fear mongering and anti-wolf hysteria in state legislatures in Idaho, Montana and elsewhere – where armchair biologists step in to make decisions about wolves that have nothing to do with ecology or wildlife biology.”
In previous interviews with the Idaho Capital Sun, Idaho Fish and Game officials were adamant their program is a reimbursement program designed to help hunters who successfully and legally kill a wolf recover costs for things like licenses, ammo, guns, fuel or even an all-terrain vehicle used for hunting wolves, and not a bounty. 
Moving forward, Molloy’s ruling throws out the U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s previous decision and sends it back to Fish and Wildlife to reconsider. 
Kelly said the ruling means Fish and Wildlife must issue a new decision that reflects the latest science and concerns raised in the lawsuit. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has the right to appeal Molloy’s ruling.

Hunters ask for another 30 days to respond to Eshelman's petition for high court review.
The post Stock growers will join corner-crossing pleadings in Supreme Court appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Stock Growers Association and others have indicated they will file briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court as Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman petitions justices to review his lower-court loss in the corner-crossing conflict.
Along with the stock growers, the Wyoming Wool Growers Association and the Montana Stockgrowers Association will file amicus briefs with the nation’s high court, Stock Growers Executive Vice President Jim Magagna said Thursday. United Property Owners of Montana also notified Ryan Semerad, an attorney for the appellees, that it intends to file a brief, Semerad said Thursday.
Stock growers will urge the court to take up the case, Magagna said. “Until the Supreme Court issues a decision, there’s going to always be uncertainty,” he said.
The stock growers’ brief won’t argue one side or the other, Magagna said. “That wouldn’t be appropriate.”
“At least we’ll know where we stand,”Jim Magagna
Semerad, a Casper attorney, represents four Missouri hunters whom Eshelman sued for trespassing after they corner crossed to hunt on public land in Carbon County in 2020 and 2021. The men stepped from one piece of public land to another — without setting foot on Eshelman’s land — in a landscape where ownership is a checkerboard pattern of mile-square parcels of alternating public and private property.
The case has implications for public access to 2.4 million acres of public land in Wyoming and 8.3 million acres nationwide and for landowners who have operated under the assumption that corner crossing is trespassing. Eshelman contends corner crossers trespass — even if they don’t set foot on his land — when they cross through the airspace above his property.
Eshelman wants the courts to declare corner crossing an illegal trespass. Blocking corner crossing allows landowners like Eshelman to essentially control public lands enmeshed in their holdings, his critics say.
One rule for all
Stock growers will be “pointing out to [the court] that the impact of this decision is not just on one landowner but potentially on landowners throughout Wyoming and throughout the West,” Magagna said.
Regardless of the outcome, “at least we’ll know where we stand,” he said. With a Supreme Court ruling, “across the West we’re all living under the same criteria.”
Amicus briefs are due Aug. 18, Semerad said, which also is the deadline for the hunters’ response to Eshelman’s petition for Supreme Court review. The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the hunters earlier this year, prompting Eshelman to take his trespass suit to the nation’s top court.
This week, Semerad also asked the court to give him another 30 days to respond to Eshelman’s petition. An extension would, among other things, give the hunters “sufficient time to review and address the points raised in the petition as well as any amicus briefs supporting the petition,” according to Semerad’s request.

While attorneys, landowners, ranchers, hunters and public land advocates face looming filing deadlines, Wyoming legislators this week unveiled a draft bill that would clarify corner crossing as a legal activity.
The Joint Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Interim Committee proposes sponsoring “Corner crossing clarification” and will consider the draft in Casper on Aug. 19. Similar bills have failed in the Legislature this year and in years past.
The bill states that a person “does not commit criminal trespass if the person is traveling from one parcel of land owned by a local government, the state of Wyoming or the federal government that the person is authorized to access to another [similar] parcel … at the corner where the two parcels meet and without causing damage to any privately owned land adjacent to the two parcels.”
Some lawmakers and law enforcement officials have asked that the 10th Circuit’s long and complex ruling be simply explained and codified.  
“It’s important we codify that the people of Wyoming have the right to access their public lands,” Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, said when she co-sponsored a similar, but unsuccessful, bill earlier this year.
A bill would make it clear that checkerboard landowners cannot turn public land into “their private playground,” Provenza said earlier this year. She called that de facto privatization, which occurs when corner crossing is blocked, “wrong and dishonest.”
Earlier this year, she also poo pooed notions that the Legislature should wait until Eshelman’s lawsuit runs its course.
“I’m not one to sit by and hope the Supreme Court makes the right decision when we know people’s rights are on the line,” she said.
Ag groups supported Eshelman
If the Supreme Court agrees to hear Eshelman’s appeal, stock growers will consider whether to file another brief that takes a stand on the issue, Magagna said. The group, wool growers and Montana landowners have sided with Eshelman in the past.
The hunters also have outside support. Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a group that raised money to defend hunters Brad Cape, Phillip Yeomans, John Slowensky and Zachary Smith in a criminal trial and Eshelman’s civil suit, supported the four with legal arguments in the past. Great Old Broads For Wilderness, GreenLatinos, Sierra Club and Western Watersheds Project also filed amicus briefs in the legal saga.
The Wyoming Stock Growers and Wyoming Wool Growers last spoke up in the 10th Circuit when Eshelman appealed a defeat handed down in 2023 by the U.S. District Court for Wyoming.
“This case is also not just about ‘innocent’ hunters just enjoying the wildlife in Wyoming, but the district court’s ruling allows any member of the public, regardless of their intentions, to trespass on private lands, or in private airspace,” Karen Budd-Falen wrote in an amicus brief. “Congress created the checkerboard system that has created this case today, and it should be up to Congress to fix it.”
United Property Owners of Montana also supported Eshelman in the 10th Circuit, even though that state is not one of the six under the court’s jurisdiction. (Parts of Yellowstone National Park in Montana do fall under 10th Circuit oversight.)
Allowing corner crossing “will upset settled expectations of landowners across the west to accommodate some ill-defined right to corner cross,” the Montana group argued. Accessing public land via corner crossing is poor public policy, will occur without public planning and deprives landowners of “the right to receive compensation for providing public access,” the Montana group said in legal papers.
The group said principles of the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act, which generally bars checkerboard landowners from blocking public access to public land, faded with the 1934 closing of the open range in the West. The 10th Circuit found the act to be relevant and alive.
But Montana landowners said tying recreation to an ag measure amounted to fitting “a square peg in a round hole.”

Rising electric rates spiked interest in rooftop solar and other home energy efficiencies — even with the state's strong fossil fuel culture. But federal cuts may put some of those options out of reach.
The post Federal energy assistance funding uncertainty worries Wyoming advocates appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming-based All Solar has seen steadily increasing demand in recent years among homeowners and small businesses seeking some level of “energy independence,” including some clients that might surprise.
“It runs the gamut,” All Solar Head of Operations Riley Pieper told WyoFile, “from Rocky Mountain Power [customers] to people in the oilfield that you wouldn’t really expect. They love their solar equipment.”
The company currently has more than 100 installs scheduled and has been preparing to expand operations in the state and potentially open new branches in Montana and Nebraska. But those ambitions might be on hold for a while, Pieper said. 
The long-running 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar will close at the end of this year due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill. A lot of All Solar’s past and prospective clients rely on the tax credit, according to Pieper. When it goes away, “it won’t make as much [economic] sense for a lot of people,” she said. “It is definitely not ideal.”

Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have frozen or cut consumer-level renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, as well as halted permitting for commercial-scale wind and solar projects and gutted research budgets and grant programs for the industries. 
Speculation abounds about the actual impacts for Wyoming homeowners and small businesses, as well as commercial wind and solar developers. Not only will the new policy moves take time to play out in the market, but many are likely to be tied up in court challenges, according to sources who spoke with WyoFile.
Rising costs
The stakes are high for a lot of Wyoming households. Many have already seen electric bills increase by double digits, and one analysis predicts the nation’s current policy direction could spike bills here by another 29% over the next decade.
“For low-income residents in particular, they’re just going to be subject to increasing [electric] rates, which is just going to continue to exacerbate as we have data centers coming online and wildfire risk continuing to drive [utilities’] insurance costs to go up,” Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Associate Jonathan Williams told WyoFile, referring to a mounting insurance cost and litigation dilemma for both electric utilities and their customers.
The council has been working for years on another federal program it believes is a particularly good fit in Wyoming, according to Williams. 
“That’s the thing that hurts so much about the loss of the Solar for All program: They’re pushing solar back to a time when only higher-income families could afford solar.”Scott Kane, Creative Energies
Solar For All, created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was aimed at helping low- and medium-income households, along with nonprofits and Native American tribes, to pay for solar panel installations. Some $30 million was set aside for qualifying Wyoming applicants, and $5 million of that was set aside for the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to cancel some $7 billion in grants already awarded under the program, throwing into doubt Wyoming’s share.
Big Wind Carpenter, a member of the Northern Arapaho tribe, serves as the Outdoor Council’s tribal engagement coordinator. Some workforce training was already underway, they said, and the tribes had identified several housing project facilities as ideal candidates for rooftop solar.
“Putting rooftop solar on those houses would have saved [money for] a lot of people who are already lower-income families,” Big Wind said.
The council estimated that perhaps more than 30% of all Wyoming households might have qualified for assistance under the Solar for All program.
The potential lost opportunity in Wyoming is compounded by the administration putting into limbo more than $50 million for the Home Energy Savings Program to help low-income households cope with rising electric utility rates “and access more reliable energy by providing rebates for home energy efficiency projects,” according to a 2024 state presentation.
Wyoming’s Grants Management Office has fielded more than 500 requests for assistance since its launch in 2024. (Wyoming Grants Management Office)
“Just across the board, on numerous programs similar to [Solar for All], which is an intent to reduce electricity bills, folks have seen uncertainty and new headwinds that have popped up,” Williams added.
Part of the drive behind the Solar for All program, according to Lander-based Creative Energies co-founder Scott Kane, was in response to the long-running tax credit for rooftop solar and criticism that it too narrowly catered to households that could afford the investment.
“The solar for all program was trying to push the energy transition in our country,” Kane said. “But it was also really motivated by environmental justice. It was really trying to make sure that the benefits of clean energy were accruing to all of society, not just the healthier economic tiers. That’s the thing that hurts so much about the loss of the Solar for All program: They’re pushing solar back to a time when only higher-income families could afford solar.”
Support, criticism for wind and solar
Despite Wyoming’s deep roots in fossil fuels and skepticism of renewables — particularly wind turbines proliferating across the landscape — more residents are warming to renewable energy, especially for powering their homes. Rising electricity rates likely play a big role.
The increasing costs are changing attitudes, Williams suggested, noting that about 70% of Wyoming residents support rooftop solar, citing the University of Wyoming’s 2022 report, Social License for Wyoming’s Energy Future. 
Lander Republican Sen. Cale Case said he has mixed feelings about the fate of federal energy assistance programs, especially those that encourage rooftop solar. Case admits to being perhaps the state’s most notorious critic of rooftop solar — he’s sponsored several bills to overhaul the state’s rooftop solar net-metering law.
“I think pricing is not very good under a net-metering situation, because the person that’s making the installation avoids fixed costs and the utility makes up those costs from other customers,” he said.
A large portion of Case’s district includes the Wind River Reservation. He said he supports energy assistance efforts there, and for low-income communities and households across the state. But, “I do want to have that dialogue about fixing that — net-metering — and a lot of other things.”
Last year, Gov. Mark Gordon established the Grants Management Office to assist local governments, businesses and nonprofits in pursuing state and federal grant programs, including initiatives under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act. The office has already fielded 500 requests, according to an annual report.
For his part, Gordon “recognizes that the Trump administration may have different priorities than the previous administration,” Gordon’s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile via email. “Ultimately, this is a decision being made at the federal level and the Governor respects whatever the final decision is on the status of those programs.”

On the National Elk Refuge in Jackson Hole, only artificial flies are allowed. The season opened Aug. 1.
The post Enchanted Flat Creek lures anglers who lure fish appeared first on WyoFile .","Legendary fly tier and angler Jay Buchner remembers his first day fishing on Flat Creek at the National Elk Refuge in Jackson Hole, back in the 1960s. “Spinning rods, worms and anything else” were permitted, he said.
On opening day, “it was a stampede,” he said of the rush to catch and take home a fat cutty. “In a couple days, they were pretty much all gone.”
About a decade or so later, managers revised regulations, limiting anglers to artificial flies. “The nature of it changed literally overnight,” Buchner said of the fishery. These days, starting Aug. 1,  anglers test their skills on large and wary fine-spotted Snake River cutthroat trout in an unparalleled setting.
You can’t go out to Flat Creek for a walk. You can’t go to the creek to picnic or meditate. “Access to Refuge waters is only permitted for the purpose of fishing,” rules state.
“Even if you can’t catch one of those beautiful, big fish, usually you see one,” Buchner said.
He’s encountered the gamut of anglers, from those ignorant of protocol who wade into a pool he’s fishing to the struggling novice dragging a fly across smooth waters.

“I’ve never yelled or hollered at anybody,” he said. But he has offered a fly or two to the struggler who might be casting something out of her grandfather’s kit.
Buchner created a small, delicate mayfly imitation nicknamed the dandruff that’s good for one strike on Flat Creek before it gets soggy. “It’s nothing you’re going to find in a store,” he said.
“One of the more important things you can do is sit down and watch,” Buchner said of Flat Creek, “see what’s going on. The views are great, the fish are wonderful. Having an opportunity to see a couple is neat, whether you can catch them or not.”

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)I recently read over my son’s last report card and was overwhelmed with pride.
It showed how far he’s come — progress that, not long ago, felt out of reach. I made mental notes of the areas where we still need to do some work, but mostly I just sat with the joy of seeing comments like “participates well in class” and “a pleasure to have in class.”
A few years ago, those kinds of remarks seemed impossible.
My son is on the autism spectrum. He’s bright, curious, and kind, but he faces challenges in areas that come more naturally to his peers — things like socializing, staying focused, and following multi-step directions.
To support his growth, our family relies on services in Milwaukee made accessible through Medicaid. Without it, we couldn’t afford the therapies and supports that have made such a profound difference in his life.
One of the most transformative resources we’ve accessed through Medicaid is applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy. Before my son began this program, he had a hard time sitting still, struggled with completing even small tasks, and rarely interacted meaningfully with others. The world often overwhelmed him, and those feelings showed up as frustration or withdrawal.
Our family was doing everything we could to support him, but we needed help. Medicaid made that possible.
The ABA therapy was intensive and, at times, exhausting — but it worked. Over time, we watched our son develop new skills, regulate his emotions, and engage with the world in a completely new way.
By the time the program ended, we had a different child. Not in that he changed who he was — but because he could finally show the world the amazing person he had always been. He could carry on a conversation, initiate play with peers, connect with adults, and begin building friendships.
Today, thanks to Medicaid, he continues to receive occupational therapy and speech therapy at school. These services help him strengthen motor skills, improve communication, and better navigate daily life. He also receives support through his Individualized Education Plan (IEP), ensuring he has the accommodations he needs to succeed. Because of this, my son is not just surviving — he is thriving.
But now, all of this is under threat.
Millions of families like mine could lose Medicaid because the Trump-GOP budget — the so-called “One Big Beautiful Act” — strips away the very support that children like my son depend on, all to finance tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy. It’s hard to describe the fear that takes hold when you realize that your child’s future has been jeopardized with the stroke of a pen.
Some 37 million children — roughly half of kids in the United States — rely on Medicaid for health care, therapies, and other essential services. For kids with disabilities, Medicaid is often the only option for accessing the support they need. Without it, families face impossible choices — foregoing therapies, draining savings, or going without care altogether.
What’s even more heartbreaking is the callousness with which some elected officials treat this issue. Watching Republican Senators dance to a disco song as they celebrated the passage of this harmful bill made me physically ill. While they partied, families across the country worried about how to care for their children, afford therapy, or keep a roof over their heads.
This isn’t political for me — it’s personal. My child is not a budget line item. He is a human being who deserves the chance to live a full and meaningful life. Every child does.
Medicaid has been a lifeline for us, and it should be protected, not gutted. No parent should have to fight this hard for basic support, and no child should have their future jeopardized by politics.
The promise of America is an opportunity for all. That promise cannot be fulfilled if we dismantle the very systems that allow families like mine to survive — let alone thrive — simply to cut taxes for the wealthy.
We need to do better. We must do better.

Mike Flood holds town halls when GOP colleagues don’t,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/08/08/why-nebraska-u-s-rep-mike-flood-holds-town-halls-when-gop-colleagues-dont/,"The booing and chants might be the point, as Democratic anger pleases Nebraska U.S. Rep. Mike Flood's Republican base.","U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb., speaks during his town hall in Lincoln on Aug 4. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood faced a hostile crowd at a concert hall this week in his district’s most Democratic city, Lincoln. 
Flood’s third and final town hall of the year drew national headlines and eyes on social media sites including X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok for the reception he received. Attendees jeered him as he defended voting for President Donald Trump’s budget and tax bill the president calls “big” and “beautiful.” Flood was asked how much it cost to be a “fascist” and faced chants of “vote him out” and “tax the rich” throughout the 90-minute affair. 
The national attention — particularly online, where voters increasingly get their news — might have been the point. Flood is a modern rarity among congressional Republicans, one who faces the electorate without pre-screening the crowd. He is the last among Nebraska’s all-GOP delegation to host town halls that way.

Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor who studies political behavior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, described the town hall as an opportunity for Flood, an attorney and former speaker of the Legislature from Norfolk, to showcase his debate skills. Flood also owns TV and radio news stations, so he is no stranger to a microphone.
“He may be feeling more comfortable having these conversations with constituents that may disagree with him, because he believes that a larger portion of the district is going to support his actions now,” Barton said of Flood. 
Lancaster County, home to Lincoln, is the second-most populous area in the state, behind only Omaha. Both are heavily Democratic cities that supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Lincoln has a Democratic mayor and a Democratic city council. 
But Flood, as Barton pointed out, won his 2024 re-election bid with 60% of the vote against Carol Blood, which may be why he feels more bullish than other Republicans in the federal delegation. He won Lancaster County that year by nearly 5,600 votes.
Flood acknowledged the GOP lean of the rest of the district near the end of the town hall, when he talked directly to viewers of a Nebraska Public Media livestream while getting booed, saying, “For those of you who [are] watching from home, please know that I’m on your side. I never forget who I’m working for.”

Earlier this year, national leaders advised House Republicans, including Flood, to avoid in-person town halls after several members hosting them since Trump’s reelection faced public protests and angry constituents. 
Retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, had held town halls for years. He said he switched to telephone town halls because of “large interest” and because it is more “civil.” 
Democrats have argued Bacon feared facing the people he represents. The new format allows his staff to pre-screen callers and cut them off if they go too far.
“Frankly, it’s more conversational,” Bacon told reporters in March. “When you got moms and dads saying we can’t bring our kids to a town hall, there’s a problem.”
Tuesday’s event isn’t the first of Flood’s town halls to go viral this year. Parts of his town hall in Columbus were widely shared online after Flood told attendees that he hadn’t read part of the Trump mega bill before passing it.
Bacon said in March that Flood likes to do in-person town halls as a way to “make the far left look bad.” Flood told reporters after his Lincoln town hall that he considers it his “job to answer their questions,” and it’s the “town square.” 
“You have an obligation to stand in the town square, regardless of your comfort level, and answer people’s questions,” Flood told the Examiner after the event. “I believe what I’m doing in Congress is the right thing.”

Flood said he understands why other Republicans are holding tele-town halls and other more controlled events, as some communicate better in that format, but in-person events are the “right thing” for him. 
“Thank you for being here, Congressman Flood … I want to ask, why it seems like you make voting decisions based on capital rather than the working class,” an attendee asked during the Q&A part of the town hall. 
Some national Republican strategists said town halls don’t help highlight the positive aspects of Trump’s second administration and its signature piece of budget and tax legislation. The reason: News and social media coverage often focuses on the outbursts and congressional reactions to them instead of the cases Republicans are trying to make about the changes. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee released a memo in late July on how House Republicans can make “August count” as they try to sell Trump’s domestic agenda to constituents. It says they need to sell the strengths of Trump’s new law, which much polling indicates is unpopular among Americans.
The memo suggests congressional members host more focused events, such as the small business roundtables that GOP U.S. Sens. Pete Ricketts and Deb Fischer often hold, as a way to counter “Democrats’ efforts” with a “disciplined and compelling communications effort.”
Fischer, for example, has an agricultural roundtable planned for Saturday with Trump’s Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in rural Saunders County.
“This is a critical opportunity to continue to define how this legislation will help every voter and push back on Democrat fearmongering,” the memo reads. “The playbook is simple: Focus on President Trump and House Republicans’ efforts to improve voters’ everyday lives and show the contrast with out-of-touch Democrats.”
Most of the state’s federal delegation recently praised the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ during a question-and-answer session with business leaders in Ashland. Nebraska’s congressional delegates spoke optimistically about federal policies helping the state’s economic future, despite some warning signs that Nebraska’s ag industry is struggling.
State and national Republican strategists have acknowledged the poor polling of Trump’s domestic agenda, but said focusing on specific provisions, such as new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, could help improve public perception of the law, as they bank on the idea that long-term messaging about the bill could shape the 2026 midterms.  
Nebraska Democrats also see potential advantages in Flood holding town halls, where activists and regular people can ask questions and frame his answers for social media sharing, which reaches more voters than a typical news story. Some also argue that much of the anger at the town halls is organic.

“Nebraskans, like Americans all across the country, are sending a loud and clear message to Republicans: You voted against us. Now we’ll vote you out,” said Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb in a statement. 
Flood’s Democratic challenger, Eric Moyer, attended the Lincoln town hall and posted on Instagram, “This isn’t going to be a friendly crowd.” Moyer’s official campaign kickoff event is next week. 
National and state Democrats point to the tax and spending bill’s unpopularity, but the party has its own problems, as recent polling shows the Democratic Party has a worse approval rating than Trump, whose approval rating remains underwater. 
Still, Democrats hold a slight lead in the party head-to-head RealClearPolitics polling average for the generic congressional ballot — a poll that basically asks voters which candidate for Congress they would prefer if the choice were between a generic Republican and a generic Democrat.
Barton, the UNL political scientist, said only time will tell if the energy from Flood’s Lincoln town hall continues and if discontent from the bluest part of Flood’s district is widespread. Midterms are over a year away. 
“These are unusual political times where you have a Nebraska congressman being called a fascist at his own town hall,” Barton said.
Flood responded to the comment during the event, saying, “Fascists don’t hold town halls with open question-and-answer sessions.”

Despite the willingness of Las Vegas officials to roll over for an underground Loop, Elon Musk’s Boring Company wants more: mainly approval to bring Teslas above ground to compete with taxis and ride-shares.
The Nevada Current, a sister publication of the Tennessee Lookout, reports the Paradise Transportation Company, a subsidiary of the Boring Company, which plans to build the “Music City Loop” in Nashville, wants a Nevada license to offer “regular transportation” services from the Vegas strip to Harry Reid International Airport and other resorts, as well as 104 tunnel stations. 
The report says Paradise would charge about half the price of a Lyft, Uber or taxi, potentially undercutting the competition.
Shockingly, an application Paradise Transportation filed in fall of 2024 tried to hide the Boring Company’s connection to the shuttle service request by using obscure names, the news outlet reports. Not until it filed a revised version late last year did people catch on to the relationship between the Boring Company and Paradise.
As Musk’s company jockeys for above-ground business, it’s still seeking permission to tunnel to the Vegas airport, and, oddly enough, the Federal Aviation Administration and federal environmental studies are the only hurdles keeping it from picking up an automatic 58 million riders annually, according to the report.
Never mind a ProPublica report showing the company built tunnels without permits for work on county property, dumped untreated water into storm drains and sewers, then was fined $112,000 – a pittance – over workers’ complaints about severe burns and muck spills. Boring is contesting those violations, according to the report.
Those are minor inconveniences as Boring and Musk drill their way into the hearts of leaders willing to capitulate for visitors to enjoy a seamless trip to Vegas where, no doubt, they will rake in hundreds of thousands at the Roulette tables, or maybe break even at best.
If it sounds too good to be true …
Back in Nashville, we’re finding out the Boring Company started floating tunnel ideas with Metro Nashville officials in May 2024. Mayor Freddie O’Connell didn’t attend that earliest meeting, and talk about a tunnel on the East Bank came and went without a serious proposal, according to the mayor’s office. 
Yet, O’Connell’s office put together a list of 70-plus questions about the Nashville proposal for Boring to sort out before it announced plans at an airport gala event. The company didn’t respond this week when the Lookout asked whether it had any comment.
The mayor’s office asked about everything from cost and ownership to liability and emergency service plans. In short, who takes the blame if the project hurts someone or fails.
Gov. Bill Lee says Boring will bear the entire cost of the project. When someone says that, get ready to slap leather (that’s a wallet for those who’ve gone cashless). 
One of the most interesting questions, though, dealt with escaping, which is critical for claustrophobic types.
  That’s some mighty narrow clearance. (Promotional video from Boring Company.)
The query says the tunnel width in Vegas allows only 3 inches between the vehicle door and tunnel wall, which is built for the size of a standard Tesla Model Y. Nevada sources tell me the tunnels are 12 feet, which should be wide enough to open car doors in case of an accident or medical crisis. It beats taking a ride in an MRI.
These people are smart enough to bore a tunnel through the desert and, presumably, through Tennessee limestone, though we’ll have to wait and see if it can be done without hitting irregular rock formations, underground water and Nashville utilities. 
They claim to have 30,000 passengers daily using 2.2 miles of tunnels and five stations in Vegas.
But for the good of people who get antsy riding in a box up to the top of the St. Louis Arch or driving through the mountain tunnel between Tennessee and North Carolina, some sort of response would be helpful, especially when it comes to emergency responses into a 12-foot-wide tunnel through which traffic can travel only one direction at a time.
Don’t count on it.
The Boring Company provided little to no information at the July 28 announcement. And state officials haven’t been much better, directing all questions through the Governor’s Office, which is largely silent on the deal.
Boring proposals in Los Angeles, Chicago and other large cities didn’t come off quite as well when people opposed them.
Stockard on the Stump: Tennessee approves no-cost lease for launching Musk tunnel near Capitol 

Similarly to Vegas, though, Tennessee appears to be bending over backwards for Musk’s company, first by fawning over the proposal at the airport, then by approving a no-cost lease three days later for a state-owned parking lot near the Capitol where tunneling is to be launched. The whole route, which could branch out to areas other than the Music City Center, Broadway and the airport, is said to be going under a long-term state lease in which Boring’s only responsibility would be to build it. And that leads to another question: Why is the state willing to give property to the richest man in the world? 
Is this really designed to cut down on Nashville’s traffic congestion, which has nothing to do with the airport? (The mess at the airport is self-inflicted, not the fault of commuters.) Or is it an attempt to cozy up to Musk and, ultimately, President Donald Trump, even though they have an on again/off again relationship that appears to depend on which way the wind blows. Or whether Tesla sales are up or down.
A new era?
After two-plus years of turbulence, the Tennessee State University Board of Trustees named Dwayne Tucker as the school’s new president, removing the label “interim” from his title.
Tucker took over the post in December 2024 as part of a last-ditch effort to keep the state from taking over operations of the historically Black university, one of two land-grant institutions in Tennessee. He opted against taking a salary at the time, but considering he had to wade through shark-infested waters to draw enough money to keep the school operating, he should be due a bit of compensation.

“My focus remains on putting TSU on a path to sustainability,” Tucker said in a statement after the board’s decision.
No single person deserves the blame for TSU’s plight. The campus has been neglected for decades, in part because the state failed to fund it adequately. State and federal studies show it was shorted by $150 million to $540 million over a century, while a federal report found it was underfunded by $2.1 billion over 30 years. 
Considering those numbers, there’s plenty of blame for everyone to shoulder. The legislature and Gov. Bill Lee softened the pain with a $250 million grant that is being used, in part, for daily operations as Tucker and staff embark on a long-term survival plan. 
Maybe Tucker can put the past in TSU’s rearview mirror, sending a message to state leaders that the university doesn’t need micromanagement while also letting college officials know the campus isn’t their personal playground either.

(Courtesy of EcoFlight)This story was originally published by Capital & Main.
Public health researcher Lisa McKenzie remembers her first aerial view of the landscape-altering impacts of fossil fuel production on the picturesque mesas that rim the western slope of Colorado’s Rocky Mountains.
“It was well pad, after well pad, after well pad,” said McKenzie, a recently retired associate professor at the Colorado School of Public Health. “I remember thinking to myself, that’s like 7,000 point sources of benzene.”
The marred panorama altered the trajectory of her work. Since the 2010s, she’s leveraged her background in environmental chemistry and epidemiology to lead seminal studies that quantified the health effects of an oil and gas extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Her research transformed how drilling is regulated nationwide.
Fracking, which forces water, sand and chemicals into the earth to crack shale and release fossil fuels, helps energy companies plumb deposits miles underground. Since its widespread adoption this century, wells have multiplied and moved closer to populated areas from California to Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Pennsylvania.
Today, a majority of Americans oppose fracking, according to an October Pew Research Center survey. Drill pads proposed on the fringes of several fast-growing suburbs led some Coloradans to ponder whether the scientific literature is now at a tipping point, like that of tobacco research, at which there is conclusive evidence to prove fossil fuel extraction harms human health. McKenzie and her peers, some of whom she inspired to research public health impacts of the industrial process in other states, think it is.
“There is starting to be enough evidence to say that living near oil and gas wells, in these areas with a lot of oil and gas development, may have health consequences,” McKenzie said, “particularly for the most vulnerable populations,” like young children, fetuses and older people with heart issues.

There is consistency of results across multiple studies that were conducted using different methodologies in various states and time periods and among diverse populations, providing heightened confidence in the body of research, she added.
Her work is pivotal to this sea change. It’s included in compendiums published in California and New York that span hundreds of pages. The pioneering scientist reflected on her extensive body of research and its impacts as she prepared for her retirement last month. Scientists she’s mentored call her humble, meticulous and brave — her studies have been publicly criticized by state health officials and the oil and gas industry.
And even with her retirement imminent, state oil and gas regulators took notice in June of several recent studies she co-authored as a reason to create a new panel of experts to evaluate recent public health research on the impacts of fracking.
  Lisa McKenzie (University of Colorado)
“This would be an opportunity for the authors of these studies to present their study methodology and findings,” said Trisha Oeth, a commissioner with the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission. “I think ultimately this would help me understand the key takeaways.”
The first of many key public health takeaways for McKenzie came in the early 2010s when she co-authored among the first studies to quantify the potential for fracking to make people sick.
Her work stemmed from a request by Garfield County officials that the Colorado School of Public Health study whether air pollution from the oil and gas wells that were encroaching on neighborhoods could impact residents’ health. McKenzie was the lead author on the project.
The first-of-its-kind study garnered national attention after it appeared in 2012 in the peer-reviewed journal Science of the Total Environment.
Its novel findings triggered a congressional field hearing that month in Denver. In the ornate Old Supreme Court chambers in the state Capitol, McKenzie told members of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources that her team “estimated higher cancer risks for residents living nearer to wells as compared to residents residing further from wells.” Benzene, a known carcinogen, “is the major contributor to lifetime excess cancer risk for both scenarios,” she testified.
McKenzie recommended that regulators reduce air emissions from oil and gas development. And she capped her six pages of written testimony by listing the limitations of her research and issuing a call for further study.
Earliest empirical evidence
Scientists nationwide took notice of this paper and others McKenzie authored in 2014 that used birth records to research connections between birth outcomes and proximity to oil and gas development. She and her colleagues found that children with congenital heart defects were more likely to be born to a mother who was living in the densest areas of oil and gas development.
“Her studies provided some of the earliest empirical evidence suggesting associations with outcomes like adverse birth outcomes and pediatric cancer risks,” said Nicole Deziel, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health, who has authored papers with McKenzie and who cited her research in testimony in 2023 before the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. “Her work also helped shape how exposure is conceptualized in this field.”
Outside academic circles, McKenzie’s findings gained traction in political campaigns. Celebrities including Daryl Hannah, Lance Bass and Hayden Panettiere cited her work in a video that called on U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colorado), then Colorado’s governor — to “ban fracking.” The video was later repurposed to target state officials across the country.
Residents used her studies to advocate for tougher rules on oil and gas pollution. As pressure built on officials, Colorado’s chief medical officer, Dr. Larry Wolk, said in a statement that McKenzie’s 2014 study “did not consider the effect other risk factors may have played” and “the findings showed only association, not causation.” Her team pointed out these limitations in their paper.
Trying to isolate which pollution sources contribute to health impacts is a tricky endeavor. Most of McKenzie and her peers’ work talks about “associations” between energy extraction and acute conditions or chronic illnesses because it’s difficult to single out one environmental contributor. And proving causation is another matter altogether.
“We almost can never do the gold standard of epidemiology, which is a randomized control trial, and that’s because first, we can’t put people in laboratories,” said the scientist from her office on the University of Colorado’s Anschutz campus, “and second, we really don’t expose people to things we know are going to harm them to see what will happen.”
The quandary didn’t stop McKenzie from continuing to ask questions about how thousands of new wells fracked in Colorado each year are impacting the health of residents.










There is starting to be enough evidence to say that living near oil and gas wells, in these areas with a lot of oil and gas development, may have health consequences ... particularly for the most vulnerable populations.


– Lisa McKenzie


In the last 14 years, her peer-reviewed studies found associations between the intensity of oil and gas exploration and congenital heart defects and neural tube defects, childhood cancer and early indicators of cardiovascular disease among residents nearby.
She and colleagues also found that home values were lower for residences closer to wells. They built on previous research in a study from early 2018, based on an air sampling campaign conducted by state and federal agencies, that estimated far higher lifetime excess cancer risks, as well as other health risks, for residents living nearest fossil fuel pads.
What makes McKenzie’s research unique is her pairing of what’s known as exposure monitoring — or the measurement of a community’s exposure to air pollutants or other environmental stressors — with detailed health assessments, said Joan Casey, an environmental epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Washington who has co-authored with the Colorado health researcher.
McKenzie also collaborated with Meagan Weisner, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, on a 2023 study of residents in Broomfield, a municipality north of Denver, that found that people living within one mile of oil and gas pads reported headaches, respiratory and gastrointestinal effects and nosebleeds more often than those living more than two miles away.
“She’s very pragmatic in the way she approaches research — she says, ‘We may find nothing, and there may be no correlation between oil and gas and these symptoms,’” Weisner said. “That’s not what we found.”
Regulators rein in oil and gas development
McKenzie’s push to expand the scientific understanding of how oil and gas pollution is associated with illness reverberated nationwide.
“I have little doubt that Lisa’s research contributed significantly to the ban on hydraulic fracturing in the state of New York — it was a meaningful part of the compendium released by Physicians for Social Responsibility at the national level,” said Lauren Swain, coordinator for the group’s Colorado chapter.
“The state of Vermont also banned fracking, Maryland essentially banned fracking, and fracking is banned along the Delaware River in multiple states,” she added.
In Colorado, the rare June decision by state regulators to convene a panel to meet directly with public health researchers underscores the widespread impact of McKenzie’s research on how states hold energy companies accountable today.
Public health advocates and residents in Colorado credit her work with raising awareness among regulators about the need to curb air emissions from oil and gas production, account for the cumulative impacts of all pollution sources when considering drilling permits, and to protect disproportionately impacted communities.
This shift culminated in a 2019 law that changed the mission of the state’s oil and gas agency from fostering energy development to prioritizing public health, safety and the environment. Today, regulators say they issue fewer drilling permits because of the tighter standards on energy companies.
“In Colorado, you almost can’t do any oil and gas rulemaking without her research coming up,” said Weisner. “She influences the overall scope of how we look at things.”
As McKenzie’s studies in Colorado built upon one another, California’s oil and gas regulator invited her and other scientists in 2020 to review the public health implications of fossil fuel development.
After synthesizing hundreds of pages of scientific research that quantified the public health impacts of oil and gas drilling, the California Geologic Energy Management Division found for the first time a “causal relationship between close geographic proximity” to such wells and “adverse perinatal and respiratory outcomes.”
In a 523-page report released by the panel in 2024, McKenzie is cited 81 times. Researchers who joined her on the panel, several of whom have co-authored studies with her, said her contribution to the current understanding of how oil and gas development impacts residents’ health was pivotal to the enactment of California’s toughest-in-the-nation setback rules. The panel’s work informed a 2022 law that requires that wells be set back 3,200 feet — more than half a mile — from residences.
“Absolutely, Lisa’s work was used as a backbone of that legislation,” said the University of Washington’s Casey. “It’s also been instrumental in giving community members scientific data they need to back up their intuition on what’s going on with oil and gas extraction and their health.”
Fierce pushback from oil and gas industry
In May, the scientist gave community members something more to work with when she co-authored a paper in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention. The study found that Colorado children diagnosed with “a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow were more likely to live near oil and gas well sites than children who were free of cancer.”
As a result, McKenzie and her colleagues suggested that a state law that requires that oil and gas development be set back 2,000 feet from residences may not be sufficient to protect kids’ health.
The paper, like most of her work, drew fierce pushback from the oil and gas industry. “By its own admission, the report fails to establish any causal connection between childhood leukemia and oil and gas production,” according to a story in Energy in Depth, a website established by the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
In an interview, McKenzie said that the study considered the overall density of oil and gas sites that emit air pollutants like benzene, a known carcinogen. She added that she and her colleagues lacked data to say how much of the contaminant toxin children were exposed to and could not conclusively say what caused leukemia.
McKenzie added that she gauges the validity and impact of her work by the number of times her peers cite it in their research. Indeed, tallies kept on Google Scholar show that her 2012 Garfield County study has been cited 853 times, and her 2014 birth outcomes study 425 times.
And her most recent first-of-their-kind findings didn’t stop there. A second peer-reviewed study published last spring in Environmental Health Perspectives — on which McKenzie advised — revealed emissions reductions practices that oil and gas operators are required to undertake at well pads in Colorado are failing to protect people living nearby.
The paper concluded that for communities near fossil fuel extraction sites “acute health risks persist after the implementation of best management practices to reduce emissions.”
“The risks surpassed Environmental Protection Agency thresholds during production — that’s not something that has been really studied,” said the EDF’s Weisner, the paper’s lead author. “Risks were assumed to be during pre-production and fracking.”
Researchers recommended that regulators establish policies that require energy companies to drill and frack wells outside of what’s known as “ozone season,” the period between May 31 and Aug. 31 when lung-damaging pollutants become trapped in the Denver basin.
Nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by vehicles and oil and gas operations react with the region’s plentiful sunlight to create ground-level ozone. Inhaling such pollution can exacerbate asthma and other respiratory conditions, particularly for children and older adults.
Cities along the eastern flank of the Rockies routinely rank among the worst in the nation for this pollution, which so far has prompted health officials to issue 23 public health alerts warning residents to reduce time outdoors since May 31. The state has failed for years to meet federal clean air standards.
Worsening air pollution and an expanding number of fracking projects on the cusp of suburban communities provide opportunities for researchers to continue to study the impacts of such industrial development on residents’ health.
And even though McKenzie is retired, she plans to continue consulting. She’s not done asking questions about how air emissions from intensifying fossil fuel development affect millions of people who call the eastern edge of the Rockies home.

(Photo provided by Cass County Vector Control)Cases of West Nile virus are springing up earlier this year in North Dakota due to wet weather creating prime mosquito breeding grounds, according to a state health official.
Fourteen human cases of West Nile virus, including three cases requiring hospitalization, have been reported in the state this summer. Cases have been identified in nine counties: Cass, Burleigh, Hettinger, McLean, Mercer, Richland, Morton, Kidder and Stutsman. Most cases have been reported since mid-July, with cases nearly doubling this week.
The virus is likely popping up earlier due to a rainier-than-normal summer creating more stagnant water pools, said Amanda Bakken, West Nile virus surveillance coordinator for the Department of Health and Human Services. The virus typically begins spreading in late August or September, she said.
“I think we are on track to certainly have more cases than last year,” she said. 
In 2024, North Dakota reported 38 human cases of West Nile virus, down from 58 in 2023, according to state data.
Bakken said most of the West Nile cases so far this year have been non-neuroinvasive, which means they haven’t been the most severe types of cases. 
West Nile virus is typically spread by mosquitoes and birds. Most people who become infected do not develop any symptoms, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. About one in five people who contract West Nile will develop a fever, headache or body aches. About one in 150 people could develop serious symptoms that include swelling of the brain that could be fatal.
As of Thursday, only three cases involved people over 60 years old. Older people are typically more susceptible to severe symptoms, Bakken said.
Cass County has six cases, more than any other county. 
Ben Prather, vector control director for Cass County, said the increasing numbers of mosquitoes and cases of West Nile are putting the state on a “bad trajectory.” 
His team has been spraying for the pests more frequently and will continue to trap and test the bugs for the disease while mosquitoes remain at elevated levels.
“We’re firing on every cylinder right now,” Prather said. 
In ground testing, Cass County Vector Control is seeing increases in the species of mosquito that typically transmits the virus, but that doesn’t necessarily translate directly to higher human cases, Prather said.
An aerial spray of the Fargo area is planned in the coming days. Minot also announced aerial spraying this week in a social media post.
Bakken said there is no statewide vector control program for North Dakota. Typically, larger cities and counties have implemented their own mosquito control measures because they levy tax dollars to pay for the program, she said.
Some vector control districts avoid spraying during the peak migration of monarch butterflies, which is expected in North Dakota during the third week of August, Bakken said.
Mosquitoes also need to be taken seriously because they can spread other diseases, such as St. Louis encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Western equine encephalitis, Bakken said.
She encourages all North Dakotans to take precautions to avoid attracting mosquitoes, such as maintaining their landscapes and ensuring all doors, windows and screens are secure.
Prather advises wearing long sleeves and pants, applying bug spray and staying away from buggy areas during dawn and dusk. He added residents can also talk to local vendors in their area to schedule a spraying of their property.
“Be prepared and assume everything is a flying needle of West Nile,” he said. “I’m not really looking forward to the second half of August.”

Some doctors and the groups that represent them say physicians’ extensive training leads to better emergency care, and that some hospitals are trying to save money by not hiring them. They support new laws in Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina that require physicians to be on-site 24/7.

EKALAKA, Mont. — There was no doctor on-site when a patient arrived in early June at the emergency room in the small hospital at the intersection of two dirt roads in this town of 400 residents.
There never is.
Dahl Memorial’s three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. So, she made a call for a medical plane to fly the patient to treatment at Montana’s most advanced hospital. Dowdy also called out medications and doses needed to stabilize the patient as a paramedic and nurses administered the drugs, inserted IV lines, and measured vital signs.
Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.
A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. Like Dahl Memorial, more than 90% were in low-volume or critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small, rural hospitals.
The results come from the 82% of hospitals that responded to a survey sent to all emergency departments in the country, except those operated by the federal government. The study is the first of its kind so there isn’t proof that such staffing arrangements are increasing, said Carlos Camargo, the lead author and a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common.
Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn’t without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians’ extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them.

The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation.
Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP.
“It’s important that folks in those areas have equal access to high-quality emergency care to the greatest extent possible,” Haddock said.
Other health care providers and organizations say advanced-practice providers with the right experience and support are capable of overseeing ERs. And they say mandating that a physician be on-site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can’t afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors.
“In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,” said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs.
“I’m not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said.
Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn’t unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup.
The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on-site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments.

But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. In Montana it was 46%, the third-highest rate.
None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Neither does Wyoming or Idaho.
But Sanford Health, which bills itself as “the largest rural health system in the United States,” is launching an emergency medicine residency in the region. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based program is intended to boost the ranks of rural emergency doctors in those states, the residency director said in a news release.
Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state’s northeast. Working in such a rural area has given him nuanced views on whether states should require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs.
Adelman said he supports such laws only where it’s feasible, like in Virginia. He said the state’s emergency physicians’ organization pushed for the law only after doing research that made it confident that the requirement wouldn’t shutter any rural hospitals.
Camargo said some doctors say that if lawmakers are going to require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs, they need to pay to help hospitals implement it.
Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn’t possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren’t refraining just to save money.
He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state’s hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. The report was part of a mandated process to improve the state’s troubled health care system.
Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians.
Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Few NPs have emergency certification, an analysis found.
The Society of Emergency Medicine PAs outlines training and experience PAs should have before practicing in rural areas or without on-site doctors.
Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night.
Haddock said ACEP wouldn’t want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded.
Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms.

She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said.
She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn’t enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways.
Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn’t had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there’s a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. Other rural hospitals, he noted, may have physicians either as permanent staff who leave after a few years or contract workers who fly in for a few weeks at a time.
People eating at Ekalaka’s sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital’s clinic all told KFF Health News that they’ve been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers.
Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who’ve been treated for more serious problems.
“We’ve got to have this facility here because this facility saves a lot of lives,” Bruski said.

Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people drove population growth in the United States last year, according to a new analysis by the Brookings Institution. (Vanesa Brashier | Bluebonnetnews.com)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and 16 states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published this week by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

(Photo by Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
Bill would add protections for children used as content by social media influencers

The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them.
The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Social media experts are skeptical about the power of new state laws

Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid.
Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939.
The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”










In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections.


– Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich


This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation.
Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said.
These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts.
Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
For family bloggers, kids make money. A Utah lawmaker wants to make sure they’re compensated, too

Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

A new study found that hospitals are increasingly buying up private physician-owned practices, and costs for services are rising. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

(Courtesy of Basin Electric)North Dakota utility regulators on Thursday approved plans for a large natural-gas power plant  that could become the largest single source of electricity in the state. 
Public Service Commission Chair Randy Christmann said Basin Electric Power Cooperative’s plan is well-suited to Williams County and provides the first additional baseload power in 45 years. 
“This is huge,” Christmann said, noting it would be the largest single plant in the state. 
The nearly $4 billion project near Epping is planned to be built in two sections, with the first starting to generate power in 2029 and the second in 2030. Each unit would be capable of generating 745 megawatts of power. 
Basin Electric says planned power plant not driven by data centers

The Bison Generation Station would burn natural gas, which Christmann said would benefit North Dakota’s oil and gas industry. It also would generate power by using steam produced by the plant to turn turbines — making it the first combined cycle power plant in the state. 
In a June hearing, Basin Electric officials said the project was not developed to meet energy demands of data centers. 
After Thursday’s vote, Christmann would not rule out data center development in the area.
“I think this is needed regardless of data center development,” Christmann said. “But data center development is likely to come somewhere and require generation.” 
Basin Electric has announced it is developing a program to deal with large-load customers such as data centers.

But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.

Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

(Photo by Taber Bain/Flickr/Creative Commons License 2.0)Amtrak Virginia’s ridership numbers continue to show increases, according to the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority. Ending fiscal year 2025, more than 1.4 million passengers traveled on state supported rail service — an increase of 4.8% compared to the same time last year. It was the region’s highest ridership recorded since the service launched in 2009,  with one roundtrip route between Washington D.C. and Lynchburg.
“The growth that we are continually seeing in our Amtrak Virginia ridership just confirms our work to expand passenger rail in Virginia,” said DJ Stadtler, executive director of VPRA in a press release. 
One of those riders is Justin Doyle, who doesn’t consider himself a train commuter. But the Richmond resident does consider himself a frequent rider and takes every chance he can to hit the rails.
“We’ve done a lot of traveling via Amtrak. We visited Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York. We were in Boston earlier this year,” he said. “We flew to Montreal at the end of 2024 and then rode the Adirondack route back to New York’s Penn Station, which was a really wonderful, very scenic trip.”
Doyle cites unpredictable traffic on Interstate 95 and environmental concerns as reasons why he opts to take the train whenever possible. But spending quality time with his six-year-old son during train rides has been the biggest benefit.
“We set up in the cafe car, play a card game called ‘Loose Caboose.’ It’s a train-themed game, which is fun,” he said. “My son and I really enjoy that.”
It’s through his frequent trips that Doyle has noticed an increase in the number of passengers. 
“There have been instances where finding a seat has been challenging on Sunday afternoons in particular,” he said. “It’s really people coming back from northeast destinations, back to Richmond.”
Sam Runner rides the train up to D.C. from his home in Richmond for work every couple of months, catching the train at the Main Street Station at 5:30 a.m. He heads back later in the afternoon. He too has seen an increase in passengers. 
“Because I’m getting on the train when it’s first leaving it’s not as crowded,” Runner said. “But the train I take back, I noticed a very big shift of the train being a lot more crowded.”
 Growing pains

While the uptick in riders sometimes causes both Doyle and Runner to have a harder time finding seats, there are changes coming, said Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High-Speed Rail and the Virginia Transit Association. 
“Virginia is kind of leading the nation in investing in passenger rail, maybe outside of California,” said Plaugher. “We’re putting somewhere in the range of $4 to $5 billion into our rail infrastructure.”
Plaugher said starting in 2020, Virginia Amtrak has bought hundreds of miles of corridors of track between Washington D.C. and Richmond, as well in the City of Petersburg to the North Carolina border. 
The expansions are part of a VPRA initiative called “Transforming Rail in Virginia” which seeks to double Amtrak state-supported service while also increasing service on the Virginia Railway Express route from Fredericksburg Line and Manassas Line, all with the goal of getting more people out of their cars and onto trains. The increase in service, such as adding more trains during rush high peak travel times will ease the pain of looking for empty seats. 
 Changes in federal funding 

Possible bumps in the future of rail travel and infrastructure improvements in the commonwealth could come from how federal dollars are awarded in the form of grants stemming from changes in a landmark infrastructure law enacted during the previous presidential administration.
According to The Architects Newspaper, infrastructure projects to improve stations, tunnels and bridges are in jeopardy because of a $2.3 billion cut in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which was created under the administration of former President Joe Biden. In addition, there will be a 91% cut to the federal administration and discretionary funding for Amtrak’s national network, which includes the northeast corridor, has been eliminated, according to a report by the House Democrats Appropriations Committee.   
Because of the uncertainty of federal dollars, Amtrak recently cut 450 positions, according to Reuters, as a way to cut annual costs by $100 million.
“In regards to future federal funding, that’s our big initiative and something that we’re meeting and having conversations with our delegation about,”  Plaugher said. “The current Infrastructure and Jobs Act expires at the end of this fiscal year, FY26, and so the future of service transportation as well as the rail grants is kind of up in the air.”
Plaugher said Virginia needs a strong federal partner when it comes to the next service transportation bill that he expects to see in 2026. 
“We’re unique in that we’re one of the few states with dedicated resources to invest in passenger rail,” he said. “But we’ve gone it alone for a long time and done everything we can. We’re kind of tapped out and we need a service transportation bill that has robust federal grants included in it.”
Current projects that have already been approved, such as the Long Bridge Project, which will create two new track railroad bridges over the Potomac River from Alexandria into D.C., have not been affected by federal budget cuts, said Gerica Goodman, director of external affairs at the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority. 
“We are fully funded in current phases of projects and we’ll continually assess our needs with other projects that may come up,” Goodman said. “Smaller projects that may need funding, we’ll continue to apply for their regular grants.”
President Donald Trump’s administration has made sweeping cuts across all sectors of the federal government, triggering the elimination of thousands of jobs and undercutting previously dedicated funding for many agencies. Inside the Federal Railroad Administration,165 employees or 14% took early buyouts, also called deferred resignation, according to Politico. To Plaugher, it’s troubling.
“Obviously that’s concerning because these are the people who approve plans, sign contracts, reimburse grants, and whatnot,” said Plaugher.
Despite the possible disruptions in service, part time commuter Runner hopes the trains in the commonwealth keep coming. 
“‘The more rail service, the better’ is something that I believe in,” he said. “For me, it’s one of those things where rail built this country. So I’d like to see it be improved and restored to some of that greatness.”

(Photo by Dave Dildine/WTOP News)Maryland commuters don’t want to be exploited by toll-road profiteers, or held hostage and manipulated into paying high tolls on highways that fail to deliver on the promise of congestion relief.
Pouring rivers of concrete to create a magic carpet for rich people isn’t a solution to the mobility crisis in the fast-growing metropolitan Washington area. We can’t pave our way out of this mess by adding more lanes of traffic on the Beltway that will soon be just as crowded as they are now.
If Maryland gives in to Virginia’s pressure to extend the Interstate 495 Southside Express Lanes into Maryland, it will be outsourcing  our state highway network to unaccountable privateers and their shareholders. With their hegemonic ambition to harvest tolls across the entire DMV and beyond, our citizens and their elected representatives will lose their ability to make transportation policy and protect the public interest.
This is just the latest chapter in the misbegotten scheme cooked up in 2017 to widen the Beltway and plunder Maryland’s commuters. If we’ve learned anything fighting this proposal for the past eight years, concession agreements to build, operate and manage toll lanes will be bound up in secret interstate accords, public-private partnership deals with foreign investors and contracts with expensive compensation clauses and penalties that kick in whenever a future transit project that’s outside the strict control of the toll regime threatens to actually improve commutes.
The solution to the region’s mobility crisis isn’t to make congestion and gridlock worse by adding new traffic backups and bottlenecks on local roads wherever the toll lanes begin and end.
The solution is a seamless, interconnected network of fast, safe and accessible rapid rail transit service, including expanded MARC service, completion of the Purple Line, and the Southern Maryland Rapid Transit (SMRT) project that’s being planned in the gridlocked Maryland Route 5-U.S. Route 301 corridor from the Branch Avenue Metrorail station to Waldorf and White Plains.
Until Maryland gets serious about the hard work of developing a long-term strategy for financing rapid rail transit, learning from the successes of other cities, regions and states across America, and the exceptional light rail and tram systems around the world, we will not be ready to seize the moment when our federal partners return in the post-Trump era.
When I was a young planner at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments in the early 1970s, and the construction of Metro was the biggest infrastructure project in America, we dreamed of a region where the automobile would not be the central organizing principle of our daily lives. A half-century later, instead of shifting our emphasis from highway investment to transit, we see this retrograde proposal to widen the Beltway as a retreat from the region’s vision of a sustainable future with mobility and economic opportunity for all.

(Photo by Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”
This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)As they try to anticipate the loss of billions to the Ohio health care system, emergency doctors warned last month that it would make patient boarding a lot worse. That’s when people have to lie for hours in the emergency department, waiting for a bed to open up in the appropriate department of the hospital.
Such waits are known to increase the likelihood of bad health outcomes and even death.
An analysis published in June found that even before Medicaid cuts kick in, the problem is getting a lot worse. Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed journal, published the analysis.
It found that boarding times reached their peak in January 2022 — which is partly attributable to the coronavirus pandemic. But it also found that they’re still elevated above their pre-pandemic levels.
“… we found that hospital boarding in the ED beyond four hours has become increasingly widespread,” wrote the authors, Laura G. Burke and Adrian Haimovich, both of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and Alexander T. Janke of the University of Michigan. 
“Boarding in excess of twenty four hours, which was rare before  the pandemic, is now more common, particularly among marginalized patient populations.”
This means that sick patients who have been stabilized in the emergency room have to wait in a room or sometimes a hallway for many hours or even a full day or more, just to be admitted to the appropriate place in the hospital — even the intensive care unit — and receive the full care that they need.
Patients in that situation often get sicker and sometimes die when they wouldn’t have otherwise.
A 2020 paper published in Critical Care Medicine said mortality among those sick enough to need intensive care was 37.6% if they were immediately admitted. 
Mortality rose to 43.4% if they had to wait in the emergency department between two and 12 hours.

Death rates rose from there, with 57.1% of patients who had to wait more than 24 hours dying at hospital.
The analysis published in Health Affairs said that well under 15% of patients faced boarding times of four hours or more going into the pandemic. That rate had risen to about 25% as of last September, according to the analysis of 46.2 million hospitalizations.
About 1% or less of patients had to wait 24 hours or more at the start of the pandemic in March 2020. That rose to more than 2% last year. 
“Boarding is a key indicator of hospital capacity strain; its sustained increase portends dangerous clinical conditions during future pandemics or other disasters,” the authors wrote.
Christina Campana, president of the Ohio Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said boarding times and the time it takes to be first seen in the emergency department are going to get a lot longer once funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act begin to bite. 
They’re estimated to slash nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending, including about $33 billion in Ohio. 
Estimates say the bill will create an additional 440,000 uninsured Ohioans. Many of its effects won’t be felt immediately because the law’s most important provisions don’t take effect until January 2027 — two months after the midterm elections.
Campana said hospitals are going to have to figure out how to pay for people when they lose their insurance because they’re not going to stop getting sick.
One way hospitals will cope is by limiting staff in emergency departments and elsewhere in the hospital, Campana said. That would increase how long patients have to wait before being taken to the place where they can get appropriate care.
The analysis published by Health Affairs seems to indicate that’s already happening.
“We’re in a boarding crisis currently,” Campana said in an interview last month. “There are no hospital beds.”
She said there will be even fewer once the One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes full effect.
“Patients don’t get the right care because the emergency department just doesn’t have the capacity and resources to carry out inpatient medicine,” she said. “The patients suffer again because there’s nowhere to put anybody. They don’t get the care that they need.”

The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring adult account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
Bill would add protections for children used as content by social media influencers
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Social media experts are skeptical about the power of new state laws
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”




In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections.


– Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich



This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
For family bloggers, kids make money. A Utah lawmaker wants to make sure they’re compensated, too
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

(Photo courtesy of Justine Wilson)When Siri Fiske founded the Mysa Microschool in Washington, D.C., in 2016, there wasn’t a widely accepted term for her small, one-room schoolhouse model.
Now, the school is referred to on its website as one of the first microschools in the nation, and Fiske has seen a growing microschool movement since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the five years since remote schooling amid pandemic-era lockdowns, microschools and homeschooling have emerged as increasingly popular alternatives to traditional public and private models. Smaller class sizes, individualized classrooms and lack of standardization are an appeal to parents, Fiske said.
“There’s this idea that people who open microschools are doing it for cultish or religious reasons, and there’s a misconception that all are like that,” Fiske said. “I’ve seen my students graduate into top colleges. There’s many ways to achieve academic success.”
Some education experts, however, have expressed concern about the growing movement. They question whether microschools are properly regulated and being held accountable, and whether they’ll pull dollars out of the public education system.
There is no federal definition of a microschool, and with the Trump administration’s plans to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, the onus is on states to figure them out.










Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving.


– Siri Fiske, founder and head of Mysa School


In some states, microschools face a bind: If they operate as private schools, they’re required to meet facility, staffing and curricular standards that are often cost-prohibitive for schools their size. If they operate under homeschool laws, they face oversight, assessment mandates and reporting requirements that aren’t designed for multifamily or educator-led models.
Some states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have passed “Learning Rights Protection Acts” to codify microschools’ right to operate.
In Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and Oregon, learning pods and microschools often face child care or private school licensing requirements if they involve multiple families, hire instructors or provide compensation for child care.
“Schools calling themselves microschools today are not what I would’ve called one back then. But I think that’s OK. It’s evolving,” Fiske said.
She pointed to the national school choice movement — and states such as West Virginia — for helping the microschool movement flourish.
In 2022, West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool, distinctly separating it from a private school, homeschool or learning pod.
Those classifications, and how these schools are funded and regulated, affect everything from whether a school must hire certified teachers to how it ensures student safety or civil rights protections. And with more public dollars flowing to private or hybrid learning options through vouchers and education savings accounts — to the detriment of public school funding, some argue — states will need to define these schools and their place in the ecosystem.
States will have to fill the gaps, said Weadé James, senior director of K-12 education policy with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank.
“Accountability can vary wildly. Some microschools aren’t required to have certified teachers, conduct annual assessments, or even guarantee civil rights protections,” said James. “If public voucher dollars are going to a microschool, there has to be some level of oversight and accountability.”
Many microschools aren’t accredited
Microschools defy easy classification, and many advocates argue that’s by design. Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, an industry group, cautions lawmakers against rushing to impose fixed legal definitions.
“Innovation is happening too fast. The moment you define it in law, it becomes obsolete,” Soifer said.
New federal school voucher program poses a quandary for states: Opt in or opt out?

A 2024 sector analysis by the National Microschooling Center — one of the only sources of national data on the topic — found that many schools are operating outside traditional education principles.
In a survey of 400 microschools across 41 states, more than 60% of founders reported they were not currently licensed educators. Eighty-four percent reported their schools were not accredited. Among prospective founders, 48% are licensed educators (though only 14% currently work in public schools), 32% come from non-education fields, and 23% are parents building schools for their own children.
Most microschools (55%) operate under homeschool laws, while others function as private schools (37%), charters (6%) or fall into unique state categories (3%), according to the analysis.
“So, you can be a private or homeschool microschool program, where you aren’t required to provide students with certified teachers, or you aren’t required to conduct annual assessments,” James said.
Often described as “homeschool hybrids” or “small-scale learning communities,” microschools often serve around 16 students or fewer, and tend to cater to families with average or above-average incomes in their area. In some states, microschools have been authorized to receive public funds through voucher programs.
Some critics note that, like private schools, microschools may charge tuition, potentially excluding lower-income families and contributing to educational disparities.
These schools often operate in commercial spaces (41%), private residences (28%) or houses of worship (25%), according to the National Microschooling Center. The center also found the movement is diversifying: 37% of prospective founders are people of color, compared with 27% of current operators.
Because building and zoning codes vary from state to state and locality to locality, many operators may be unaware of the extra costs to meet school codes standards. Fiske recalls difficulties in expanding from Washington, D.C., to Vermont, which has stricter laws on water fountain requirements.
“Most people in the U.S. starting a microschool are doing it under the radar because the regulations to open a licensed school are so intense,” Fiske said. For the new school, she recalled, “it took us forever, and we had to install ADA-compliant toilets and water fountains for just 10 kids in Vermont.”
‘Microschooling is not one thing’
Microschools also operate in a legal gray zone, often outside the traditional K-12 system and subject to a patchwork of state and local policies that can either support or constrain their growth.
Growth has accelerated in conservative-leaning states with robust school choice programs, such as Arizona and Florida. Other states, such as Maryland, New York and North Dakota, have more restrictive homeschool or private school laws.
“Microschooling is not one thing. These schools look different in every state, and the policy frameworks around them vary wildly,” said Soifer, of the National Microschooling Center.
What is classified as a microschool can vary from “10 kids in a basement in Kentucky” to a 200-kid schoolhouse elsewhere.
Public school enrollment continues to fall

Fiske said states need to create a way for operators and parents to know what to expect in a certain state, and help willing operators get the education and business acumen they need to run the schools successfully.
“But if you look at who is starting microschools in the U.S., it’s a lot of millennial parents who may not have any teacher training but wanted to create a learning environment for their children and others in the local community,” said Fiske. “And without efforts by the state to provide some incentives to earn accreditation and information as both a school and a small business, a few of these will find themselves going under.”
Seeking choices
After two decades working in conventional schools in the United States and around the world — including in Brazil, Egypt and Qatar — Justine Wilson turned down a high-paying leadership role at a prestigious private school. Instead, in 2023 she opened Curious and Kind Education, a two-day-a-week microschool in Sarasota, Florida, built around trust, nature-based learning and self-directed play.
Enrollment at Curious and Kind is mostly driven by word of mouth, she said. The program now has a waitlist. And Wilson has seen her enrollment grow from 18 students in her first year to roughly 100 students for the upcoming school year.
“The number of 5-year-olds on my waitlist is shocking,” she said, “and then I realized they’re COVID babies and their parents have really been driving this search for alternative schooling since the pandemic.”
James, of the Center for American Progress, questions whether microschools generally match the quality of traditional public schools, which still educate more than 80% of schoolchildren. She says families may be under the assumption that school choice options equate to better quality.
“We have created an illusion of choice to be quality, and I think a lot of families are seeking various choice options because they associate that with quality. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that where those students are going is any better than where they left,” she said.
“We need to take a closer look at what we are presenting to families,” James said. “It’s not just about having options and having a choice. It’s about having quality choice options.”
That quality, Soifer said, is what microschools are trying to achieve.
“Microschools do very well on the left, on the right … at the top end of the economy and at the fragile end of the income spectrum,” he said. “It’s really a matter of the new economy and a new way of thinking about education.”

Imagine a future where your monthly bills are lower, your energy is cleaner, and you know exactly how much your energy bill will be when it is due. For us in North Carolina, that future is now in grave danger due to illegal funding cuts from the federal government.
Three years ago this month, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed by President Biden to reduce inflation, fund climate projects, and build a pathway to a more sustainable and equitable future. However, many of these programs have been abruptly cut by the Trump administration, leading to job losses and economic instability.
Just this week, The New York Times reported the Environmental Protection Agency is contemplating cancelling 7 billion dollars of grants under the Solar for All program. Over 156 million of these dollars were awarded to North Carolina grantees to help low-wealth families, renters, and rural communities access clean, affordable energy.
One year ago, I wrote of my optimism for the billions of dollars coming into North Carolina, specifically to sustain our most underserved communities. Since the launch of our website tracking these programs in January 2024, I have worked with hundreds of residents to weatherize their homes, lower their taxes while making energy efficient improvements, and take control of their electricity bills.
It is heart-wrenching to look back at the people I’ve met and think of the stories I’ve heard from folks when I know they may now no longer be able to access resources their tax dollars pay for.
A social worker in Granville County looking for emergency funds to help a resident who had been disconnected from power for over three weeks. A senior in Edgecombe County on Social Security who was scammed while trying to replace their HVAC unit. A landowner from Yancey County who was impacted by Hurricane Helene and is just trying to get on their feet.
These residents, each of whom I have directly worked with, are at risk due to program cancellations by the federal government.
Individual residents aren’t the only ones who have benefited from Congress’s decision to fund IRA programs. Businesses have seen major expansions and investments from the clean energy tax credits, which have generated $16.2 billion in new private-led investment for over 60 energy and manufacturing facilities across North Carolina. Another 7 billion dollars of private investments have already been announced for more than 100 facilities statewide.
This capital brings well-paying jobs to our state and further cements North Carolina as the number one state to do business in. Because of these cuts, we are at risk of losing over 20 billion dollars of investments and over 17,000 jobs. A majority of these opportunities are in rural communities, where folks already struggle to find good jobs to feed their families. As the number one state for rural clean energy jobs, North Carolina simply cannot afford these losses.
We as North Carolinians cannot continue to accept the illegal and cruel clawback of funds that help our neighbors keep their lights on, make our homes healthier, and support an overdue transition to clean and reliable energy.
When it was passed, the Inflation Reduction Act represented a transformative opportunity for North Carolina, promising to bolster economic stability, foster environmental sustainability, and create a more equitable energy landscape. Now, this future is directly threatened, and we must fight for it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solarpanelworker2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-08 05:56:10.638131

Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich of Fort Smith, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”










In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections.


– Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich


This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.

Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In a series of decisions on transgender legislation this year, Gov. Kelly Ayotte has taken a page from her predecessor’s playbook.
Like former Gov. Chris Sununu, Ayotte signed two bills, House Bill 377 and House Bill 712, that ban gender-affirming care for minors, meaning the state will soon bar all forms of such care for people under 18, including medication and surgeries. But also like Sununu, Ayotte vetoed a bill, House Bill 148, that would have allowed businesses and organizations to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams by biological sex. 
The result is a combination of decisions that has frustrated people on both sides of the debate. Conservatives and other Republicans sharply criticized Ayotte for vetoing HB 148, with one, Rep. Erica Layon of Derry, arguing she had “broken her promise to protect women.”
“I was stunned to learn that Governor Kelly Ayotte vetoed a bill meant to protect women’s spaces from men — an unthinkable rejection of women’s safety and rights,” Layon said in a statement in July. “… Many Granite Staters, especially women like myself, are saying that they feel betrayed, misled, and let down by the Governor’s broken promise.”
LGBTQ+ support organizations in New Hampshire, meanwhile, say that while they appreciate the veto on HB 148, the ban on gender-affirming care for minors will set back transgender youth and curtail parents’ rights to decide their children’s health care.  
And they are hoping to fight the new laws and give advice to transgender teenagers and their families in the meantime.
“We’re lucky to be surrounded by states that provide gender-affirming health care to young people,” said Linds Jakows, the founder of 603 Equality, an advocacy group.
Options for teens and families
Advocates say they are working to inform families about their options. 
To start, the new bans on gender-affirming breast surgeries and medication treatments for minors do not take effect until Jan. 1, activists note. And under the new laws, anyone who receives care before the ban will be able to continue to do so even after the ban takes effect.
“We are really asking folks in our orbit to publicize that the bill does not go into effect around puberty blockers and hormone blockers until Jan. 1, and if it is an appropriate choice for kids to seek care, we are strongly encouraging them to be in touch with Dartmouth Hitchcock and their gender affirming care clinic,” said Heidi Carrington Heath, executive director of New Hampshire Outright, an advocacy organization. 
For teens and their families who want to begin after January 2026, the bans will require them to travel out of state to get care. That prospect carries with it numerous hurdles: It is more time-consuming, it could incur transportation and accommodation expenses, and it could mean a pricier cost of care if the out-of-state provider is not in that family’s insurance network.
There is a program that could help families do so, Jakows says: the Trans Youth Emergency Project. Run by the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ+ rights group that primarily operates in Southern states, the project allows families living in states where transgender care is banned $500 every three months to cover travel expenses to other states. 603 Equality has partnered with the Campaign for Southern Equality to bring the program to New Hampshire. 
The project also provides one-on-one consulting for teens and families weighing their options, given the new bans. 
“603 Equality and the Campaign for Southern Equality urge families with transgender youth to consult with their child’s physician as soon as possible about care plans,” the organizations wrote in a joint statement shortly after Ayotte signed HB 377 and HB 712 on Aug 1. “The Trans Youth Emergency Project is here to provide support to families of trans youth in New Hampshire in this difficult climate.”
Legal action contemplated
Many of the legal avenues to fight New Hampshire’s ban are now blocked by a U.S. Supreme Court decision from June. In U.S. v. Skrmetti, the court upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, and dismissed arguments that it was unconstitutional. 
But to Chris Erchull, staff attorney at the GLTBQ+ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), that decision does not end all arguments against the new laws.
The Skrmetti case was based on the argument that Tennessee’s law violated the 14th Amendment by classifying teenage patients by transgender status and barring health care only to transgender teenagers. The court found, instead, that Tennessee’s law classified usage based on age and medical use, not trangender status, making it legal.
Erchull says the Supreme Court did not extend its decision to cases in which it is proven that a law is intended to discriminate against transgender people. And he said the court did not contemplate the argument that such a law could violate parents’ rights under the 14th Amendment to determine the health care of their children. Both of those arguments could be valid approaches to challenging New Hampshire’s law, Erchull argued. 
Erchull also said there could be an avenue to challenge the laws under the state constitution, which also prohibits sex discrimination.
“I think we have ample evidence in this case that the motivation for the ban on medical care was an effort to single out transgender kids for different treatment and deny them access to care that they need,” he said in an interview. 
Erchull declined to answer specific questions about whether GLAD is planning to sue the state in state or federal court to overturn the laws. The organization is currently involved in a federal lawsuit against a 2024 New Hampshire law that bars transgender girls in grades 5-12 from participating in girls’ sports. 
Political advocacy continues
LGBTQ+ advocates say they’re hoping to shift the political narrative into one more supportive of trangender people. That means encouraging affected families to share their stories with voters and community members, they say. 
“We know that the power of telling those stories can help to move the needle,” said Carrington Heath. 
Jakows noted that 603 Equality has begun hosting listening sessions in Dover, New London, and Plymouth, and hopes to put on more. 
“We want to spend more time organizing communities and getting people to talk to their friends and neighbors to share stories about transgender and nonbinary lives that counteract the flood of misinformation that is going on at the State House,” Jakows said. 
Jakows said Ayotte had signed the bills even after members of her office had met with parents of transgender children, arguing the governor had sided with “fear and misinformation.”
Still, some of the advocacy efforts this year may have influenced Ayotte’s decision to veto HB 148, Jakows argued. Parents and teens reached out to Ayotte’s office urging the veto. And activists attempted more high-profile visibility efforts, too.
At Manchester’s pride parade on June 28, transgender performer Bobby Bratwurst took part in a float with a pointed message. Bratwurst, dressed as Lady Liberty, stood near a portable toilet and made statements like “going to the bathroom is a human right.” 
And in May, demonstrators at the State House showed up during a House voting session dressed up as “genital observation police,” handing out cards to lawmakers entering bathrooms telling them they needed to have their private parts inspected by a Republican lawmaker before entering, The Boston Globe reported. 
Those efforts kept the issue in the public eye, Jakows said, and may have helped push Ayotte to issue her veto.
“I believe there are important and legitimate privacy and safety concerns raised by biological males using places such as female locker rooms and being placed in female correctional facilities,” Ayotte wrote in her veto message. “At the same time, I see that House Bill 148 is overly broad and impractical to enforce, potentially creating an exclusionary environment for some of our citizens.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/transbillroundup-1024x730.jpg,,,2025-08-08 05:56:10.638131

The next time someone tries tell you that the North Carolinians with Medicaid health insurance are lazy slackers who participate in a wasteful program that warrants the massive bloodletting President Trump just approved, tell them talk to an actual frightened person who depends on the program.
Someone like Maddie Wertenberg. She’s a Wake County mom who had private health insurance, but who still only avoided being stuck with life-altering hospital bills for the care of her premature baby, because he was so tiny he qualified for Medicaid.
Or someone like Crystal Upchurch. She’s a lifetime Raleigh resident who is only alive because Medicaid covers the cost of the daily dialysis treatments she receives.
The bottom line: Proponents of Trump’s big bill may say they have no intention of cutting off people like Maddie and Crystal, but the massive funding cuts make it inevitable that vast numbers of people with similar stories will be sentenced to crippling debt and premature death. And the sheer cruelty at work here, and the terror its inflicting on millions of good people, is hard to overstate.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)It’s been about six months since the U.S. Department of Education sent a “Dear Colleague” letter to all schools that receive federal funding, warning them that they could risk losing this money if they promote what the department calls “pervasive and repugnant” racial preferences.

The letter, among other things, reversed previous presidents’ positions on how diversity, equity, and inclusion influences schools’ disciplinary measures. It advised schools to, within two weeks, begin to eliminate all discipline protocols rooted in DEI, on the grounds that this work is discriminatory against white students.
Trump also issued an executive order, “Reinstating Commonsense School Discipline Policy,” in April 2025, doubling down on the letter.
Trump’s letter and executive order exert an unusual level of influence over how schools can decide the best way to teach and, when necessary, discipline students. It also cuts against recognized research that Black, Latino, and Native American students are disciplined more frequently and harshly than white and Asian students.
I am an educational scholar who has spent the past 13 years analyzing school discipline policy. While previous administrations have issued “Dear Colleague” letters to schools, Trump’s is the first that frames itself as though it were law — setting a potential new precedent for the executive branch to issue educational mandates without the approval of the judicial or congressional branches of government.
While all but two states have responded to Trump’s letter, about half of them have said they are not going to comply with its terms — despite the administration’s threat of cutting funding if they do not follow the guidance.
Understanding DEI in education
Equity-oriented education, or diversity, equity, and inclusion, refers to an ideology and programming that intend to ameliorate patterns of racial inequality. In the context of discipline in schools, DEI strategies could include teachers having conversations with children about their behavior, rather than immediately suspending them.
Research shows that these techniques can help reduce racial discipline gaps in academic achievement and disciplinary outcomes.
The Obama administration in 2014 recognized this research in its own “Dear Colleague” letter to schools. The administration advised schools to either reform their discipline practices toward nonpunitive alternatives to suspension or risk being investigated for discrimination.
The first Trump administration rescinded this letter in 2018.
Then, in 2023, the Biden administration released a document along the same lines as Obama’s letter.
Trump’s February 2025 letter grouped all of these recommendations under the banner of “DEI” and argued that such practices are discriminatory, privileging students of color over white and Asian students.
In his April executive order, Trump reiterated that if schools did not eliminate DEI, they would be out of compliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin,
Public school districts regularly have to issue a certificate of compliance to the government showing that their work is in line with Title VI.
While the Trump administration characterizes DEI as “smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming, and discipline,” it does not define exactly what constitutes DEI programming.
This puts school districts at risk of losing funding if they maintain any initiatives related to racial equality.
Legal concerns with Trump’s directives
The executive office and members of Congress typically issue “Dear Colleague” letters, which are not legally binding, to advise schools and others on policy.
Yet Trump’s letter was written like a mandate and reinforced by an executive order, which is legally binding.
Some scholars are calling the letter an “overreach” of legal authority.
In the spring of 2025, I analyzed states’ responses to Trump’s letter and executive order.
Two states, Iowa and Tennessee, had not yet provided public responses.
Twenty-three states complied with the administration’s directive by signing the letter as of May 30. Some, like Oklahoma, not only certified the letter but also passed state laws banning DEI policies and programs.
The remaining 25 states refused to certify the letter, asserting that they already complied with Title VI and that their policies are not discriminatory.
In addition, 19 of those 25 states sued the Trump administration over the letter in April, culminating in a court injunction later that month that temporarily released states from having to comply with its demands.
I noticed that many states that refuted Trump’s letter used the same exact words in their responses, signaling a concerted effort to resist Trump’s directives. States that did not sign on to the letter but objected to its intent generally resisted on legal grounds, ethics, or both.
A legal argument
Most states that rejected it grounded their refusal to sign Trump’s letter in federal law. They cited the Civil Rights Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act, which protects states from having to file redundant paperwork. Because these states already certified compliance with Title VI, this argument goes, they should not have to do so again under Trump’s directive.
Education commissioners from a few states, including Illinois and Minnesota, also cited specific language used by Betsy DeVos, Trump’s former education secretary in his first term, who supported DEI policies.
Charlene Russell-Tucker, the education commissioner for Connecticut, also pointed out that in order for the federal government to cancel DEI programming, it would have to first legally change the definition of Title VI.
States resisting on other grounds
Some education officials also argued that their DEI work is ideologically necessary for providing supportive learning environments for all students.
Patrick Tutwiler, Massachusetts’ interim education commissioner, wrote in an April 16 letter, for example, that “Massachusetts will continue to promote diversity in our schools because we know it improves outcomes for all of our kids.”
Other officials displayed more subtle resistance. Randy Watson, Kansas’ education commissioner, for example, affirmed the state’s “commitment to comply with all Federal statutes,” including Title VI – but did not explicitly address Trump’s “Dear Colleague” letter.
Similarly, Kentucky informed the Department of Education of its compliance with federal law, while simultaneously encouraging local districts to continue diversity, equity and inclusion work.
Mississippi’s state department of education pointed out that school districts operate independently, so the state cannot force policies on them. However, Mississippi signaled compliance by citing a new state law banning DEI and confirmed that each of its individual school districts have already certified compliance with federal laws.
More legal pushback
It is not yet clear what might follow the April court injunction, which largely prevented the Department of Education from cutting federal funding to schools that continued their DEI-related programs and policies.
While the Trump administration has made major cuts to the Department of Education, it has not announced that states refusing to certify the letter will lose funding.
This is the first time an administration is issuing such a direct threat to withhold K-12 funding, placing schools in an unknown place, without a clear blueprint of how to move forward.

A war was brewing in Westerville 150 years ago.
Henry Corbin opened a saloon in Westerville in 1875, but the people did not want it.
“They thought that saloons brought in a bad element, that they would bring in crime, they would bring in certain kinds of people that they didn’t want,” said Westerville History Museum Manager Jackie Barton. “Make no mistake, people were drinking alcohol in Westerville. People would get their alcohol at the pharmacy. It was medicinal.”

People protested the saloon by egging it, throwing rocks through the windows, and setting it on fire before ultimately blowing it up with dynamite.
The Corbins came back in 1879 and opened the saloon back up, but it was blown up again and that was the end of the Whiskey Wars.
“When you really think about the fact that’s domestic terrorism, it starts to really make you think about how people were engaging and dealing with their stress around this idea of a saloon,” Barton said.
The Westerville Whiskey Wars set the scene for Ohio and Westerville’s major role in the Anti-Saloon League and Prohibition. Aside from a short period after the 21st Amendment, Uptown Westerville remained dry until 2006.
Today, alcohol flows freely in Westerville and it has transformed the uptown area.
“They’ve been so successful in making it a dining destination, an entertainment destination in the old historic part of Uptown,” said Joe Meyer, author of “Westerville: The War Machine of Prohibition.” 
“That all came about, really, after alcohol sales were allowed and the redevelopment of the whole district.”
 Prohibition
The Anti-Saloon League started in Oberlin, Ohio in 1893 as a statewide organization that quickly expanded nationally.
The League moved its national headquarters from Washington D.C., to Westerville in 1909 and Westerville Public Library’s Anti-Saloon League Museum is located in the League’s old headquarters.

The League’s publication The American Issue was also in Westerville and had a circulation of more than 18 million in 1920. The League mailed more than forty tons of mail each month out of Westerville, which earned the nickname “The Dry Capital of the World.”
“It seems so archaic to us now, in some ways, to think there were tons of people that were driven by the idea of trying to make everyone not drink any alcohol,” Barton said.
Many people believed alcohol was the root of many social problems.
The 18th Amendment was ratified on Jan. 16, 1919, which made prohibition the law of the land.
But cracks in the League were starting to form, Barton said. Some members wanted to push for enforcement while others wanted to continue educating folks on why alcohol is bad.
“There was really a schism in the organization between these two — rule of law versus hearts and mind campaign,” Barton said.
Bootleggers who illegally manufactured and sold alcohol became prominent figures as a direct response to Prohibition. The Great Depression took hold in 1929 and the federal government saw the potential tax income from alcohol sales.
“(Prohibition) was a failed experiment,” said Jim Seitz, of the Westerville History Museum.
The 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment in 1933 and there was a brief period of time where Westerville served alcohol.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Cullen-Harrison Act into law in 1933, which legalized the sale of beer and wine with an alcohol content of up to 3.2%. A Westerville pool hall owner started serving beer, but Westerville voted itself dry in November.
The Anti-Saloon League became the Temperance Education Foundation in 1934, which stayed in Westerville until 1973.
 Liquor License Vote 
Westerville voters approved a liquor license for the first time in the Uptown District in 2004. It was for Old Bag of Nails Pub, but Michael’s Pizza ended up serving the first beer in Uptown Westerville in 2006 after they also received their liquor license.
Ohio allows localities to ban the sale of liquor and the state’s alcohol laws give voters a chance to decide on the sale of alcoholic beverages at the precinct level. This typically affects the type of alcohol sales, days alcohol can be sold, and carryout purposes, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce. Liquor licenses are address specific in Westerville.

Selling alcohol has improved Uptown Westerville’s restaurant selection, Seitz said.
“The restaurant makes most of their money off their beverage sales, not the food sales,” he said. “So if you don’t have the high priced beverages, then you’re losing a huge portion of your profit.”
Not everyone was for serving alcohol in Westerville and an opposition group called STOP (Safety and Tradition Over Profits) popped up during the 2004 election.
“I definitely still hear people bring up that they think it’s a shame that we’re not still dry,” Barton said.
 Temperance Row Brewing Company 
Temperance Row Brewing Company was the first brewery to open in Westerville in 2014, just down the street from the League’s old headquarters building.
“We’re having beer about 200 yards away from the nucleus of people that didn’t want it,” said Tony Cabilovski, owner of Temperance Row Brewing. “It’s hard to wrap our heads around this being the central base for so much anti-alcohol propaganda back in the day.”
Several of the brewery’s beers pay homage to Westerville’s history, including Prohibition Pilsner, Corbin’s Revenge IPA, Forty Ton Porter and Gunpowder IPA.
“If you were here on a Tuesday or Thursday night at 7:30 (when Westerville was dry), it was kind of a sleepy town,” Cabilovski said. “A lot of the shops are already closed. And back then, the dynamic and the makeup of the shops were different. … But if you come here on a Tuesday or Thursday night now, it’s a much more vibrant town. … It’s changed everything for, I think, the better.”
Westerville is now home to four breweries — Temperance, North High Brewing, Campfire Brewing and Grizzlybird Brewing.
“I think, not just with alcohol, but any community is a little afraid to change initially,” Cabilovski said. “I think there’s even a nostalgia factor. Some people just like being known as a dry town.”
 Westerville Whiskey Wars 
This year marks the 150th anniversary of the Westerville Whiskey Wars, which lasted from 1875 to 1879.
High Bank Distillery opened their third location in Westerville about a year ago — in the same location as the town’s original post office where forty tons of prohibition propaganda was mailed each month.
“It was definitely a building that called out to us,” said Adam Hines, co-founder of High Bank Distillery. “It’s ironic for sure, but it’s a story that I love to tell.”
The distillery has a speakeasy in the basement called P.O. Box 21, another ode to Westerville’s history.
High Bank’s flagship whiskey is Whiskey War and each bottle tells the story of Corbin and the Westerville Whiskey Wars.
“I think (Corbin) would be proud that there is a local Columbus brand telling the story of the whiskey wars … via whiskey,” Hines said.

After six years and more than a half billion dollars in consumer costs, Ohio utility customers will no longer have to subsidize two 1950s-era coal plants, one of which is in Indiana.


A new law that takes effect on August 14 officially eliminates the coal subsidies created by House Bill 6, the 2019 nuclear and coal bailout law at the heart of Ohio’s ongoing utility-corruption saga.


Despite the Trump administration’s push to keep polluting coal plants open, their electricity is generally less competitive than alternatives such as combined-cycle gas, solar energy, and wind power. These two coal plants in particular are often among the most expensive options available in the grid region serving Ohio, and yet have run anyway.


Lawmakers repealed HB 6’s nuclear bailout less than a year after the corruption scandal became public, with the arrests of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and others in 2020, but multiple bills to repeal the coal plant subsidies failed. It wasn’t until HB 15 passed in May that lawmakers finally agreed to end the mandated payments — at least for the 5 million customers of Ohio’s regulated utilities.


Since 2001, customers of Ohio’s regulated utilities have had the option to choose their electricity supplier, and utilities have generally been banned from favoring or subsidizing related generation companies.


Starting in 2013, however, Ohio utility companies began seeking ratepayer-funded bailouts for the two old coal plants — the Kyger Creek plant, in Cheshire, Ohio, and the Clifty Creek plant, in Madison, Indiana — owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, or OVEC. OVEC’s shareholders are parent companies of Ohio’s regulated utilities.


The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, or PUCO, let some utilities begin collecting charges in 2017, but those orders faced challenges. Two years later, HB 6 guaranteed those payments through 2030.

The subsidy cutoff comes none too soon, according to an August 4 analysis prepared by RunnerStone for the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association. Ohio utility customers could have paid over $413 million more through 2030. As things stand, the HB 6 subsidies plus earlier payments under challenged regulatory orders total more than $683 million, the analysis shows.


“Instead of propping up shareholders, this money should have gone to help Ohio’s families pay for needed items like groceries, health care, and other essentials,” said Maureen Willis, who serves as Ohio Consumers’ Counsel. As she sees it, ​“ending the coal plant subsidies is long overdue.”


Yet controversy continues over whether large chunks of the charges were reasonable and prudent, as required by Ohio law.


One case at the Ohio Supreme Court deals with amounts collected in 2018 and 2019. Another appeal challenges the PUCO’s approval of charges in 2020 under HB 6. Both cases are waiting for the Ohio Supreme Court to schedule oral argument.


The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group, and the Ohio Environmental Council, and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel are challenging the utilities’ decision to pass along the costs of running the old coal plants full tilt even when it was uneconomical, among other things.


Challengers in the HB 6 case argue that the PUCO rulings improperly presumed that the coal plant charges were lawful, instead of making the utilities prove it. The commission then limited challengers’ ability to show that the costs for running the plants during poor market conditions failed to meet statutory requirements, they say.


The case for the 2018 and 2019 charges also includes an argument that the commission improperly influenced an independent audit. For instance, a commission staff member asked the auditor to ​“tone down” a draft report saying that the plants’ must-run strategy was not in the best interests of ratepayers.


Beyond that, a pending regulatory case will examine the coal plants’ costs from 2021 to 2023. And a July 31 filing by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel has asked the public utilities to open a case to review the coal plant charges for 2024 and 2025. The commission has not yet ruled on the request.


Meanwhile, spokespeople for American Electric Power and FirstEnergy told Canary Media their Ohio utilities will no longer include the coal charge on bills after August 14.
 Others still paying
Due to a 2011 agreement among OVEC’s shareholders, both plants intend to keep operating until 2040.


So while customers of Ohio’s regulated utilities will no longer have to pay for the OVEC plants, other consumers will continue to bear the costs, said Neil Waggoner, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal program in the Midwest.


Those include the more than 380,000 homes and businesses that get their electricity from Ohio’s Electric Cooperatives, whose supplier is Buckeye Power.


Buckeye has an 18% share in OVEC, the next largest after AEP’s stake of roughly 39%. Elsewhere in the Midwest, Michigan’s public service commission recently disallowed more than $2 million in expenses charged by AEP’s Indiana Michigan Power for the same OVEC plants, while a July 23 ruling requires ratepayers in Indiana to pick up those costs.


Environmental costs from the plants also continue. Since 2020, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel estimates, the plants have spewed more than 63 million tons of carbon dioxide. The plants also emit nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate pollution that can cause health problems for those living downwind.


“That is a lot of dirty air,” Willis said, adding that ​“consumers got the bill, while the environment and public health paid the price.”


Both the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants cleared PJM’s capacity auction last month, which will pay generation facilities roughly $329 per megawatt/​day starting in June, said American Electric Power spokesperson Scott Blake, who also speaks for OVEC.


But even with the subsidies phasing out for many Ohio utility customers, Waggoner said that the bad business decision to keep these coal plants running has gotten even worse.
“These plants are really old industrial facilities,” Waggoner said. ​“They’re at the end of their lives. It’s time for these plants to be retired or replaced.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)There you are — a Kansas teacher supervising a high school hallway in between classes.
Students flood past you in a clattering blur of high-top sneakers, yoga pants and laughter.
One student strides past you, pulling a cellphone out of her purse to respond to an email. Another student, on her way to photography class, slides her digital camera into its case. A third student slings a backpack over his shoulders, laptop stowed safely in the main pocket.
Your job seems simple: keep these students safe. But how much surveillance is needed to protect them?
Will you monitor every message in the email account of an honor roll student? Will you inspect the images of the award-winning student photographer? Will you reach into the backpack of a random student to inspect his laptop?
A federal lawsuit filed last week by students in Lawrence alleges their school district has gone too far in its surveillance. The plaintiffs, former and current Unified School District 497 students, claim the use of Gaggle, digital surveillance software deployed by the district, unconstitutionally monitors them while infringing on their First and Fourth Amendment rights.
During an interview this week, Harrison Rosenthal, one of the attorneys representing the students, extended my hallway metaphor.
He said USD 497 is “reaching into the private files of students and basically conducting what we think is a digital strip search. This would be akin to the school going into lockers, opening the lockers, opening the bookbags — your private bookbags — and searching and rummaging around your personal files.”
Mark Johnson, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said USD 497’s use of Gaggle is worse than that. The surveillance isn’t reaching into just one student backpack.
“It’s everybody,” Johnson said.
As the former director of an association dedicated to student journalism, I know and admire the journalism teacher, many of the students, and two of the lawyers at the heart of this lawsuit. Some of the students also have been my students at the University of Kansas.
Hearing their stories in conversation since the controversy began made it clear to me how overreaching and ineffective the district’s surveillance has been. The 311-page lawsuit intricately describes the district’s failures.
In this fully digital age of American education, students at many Kansas high schools are now required to do most of their coursework on computer, often using software mandated by the district. In USD 497, this means software in the Google Workspace/Suite. And that platform is monitored by Gaggle.
This creates a disturbing domino effect. Students must attend school. They must use Google software. And therefore, they must submit to 24/7 Gaggle oversight of their every keystroke.
In this way, Kansas students are obligated to be surveilled.
The stated objectives of the district’s contract with Gaggle is about student safety. One USD 497 agenda described Gaggle as “a digital surveillance tool that helps school districts manage student safety on school-provided devices and platforms by monitoring student accounts to identify and flag those who may be struggling and need help.”
As the complaint details, one district employee said in a meeting that student journalists were “valuing their constitutional rights above the mental health of their peers.”
  Then-Lawrence High School student journalists Jack Tell, left, and Morgan Salisbury, answer questions during an April 18, 2024, interview. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
In an era of problematic teenage mental health and suicide trends, a seemingly sophisticated intervention or technological solution is enticing for our schools.
Embedded in the complaint is Exhibit O, a spreadsheet with 1,246 rows — each one detailing an instance when Gaggle found problematic content in a student’s digital lives. Reading the words found in student documents creates a grim portrait of Lawrence students and the American teenage psyche: “i’m broken,” “slit my wrists,” “suicidal,” “cutting,” “i’m not okay,” “voices in my head,” “wanted to die,” “i have no hope.”
I asked Rosenthal why school districts shouldn’t respond with surveillance like Gaggle.
“Student safety should be a paramount concern for the district, but surveillance can’t come at the expense of constitutional rights,” Rosenthal said. “Safety does not mean dragnet, widespread, suspicion-less searches of every student’s thoughts. And it’s incumbent upon the district to craft a mechanism that keeps with the Constitution.”
This controversy has been brewing for months. Students from Lawrence High School have been questioning and opposing the district’s use of Gaggle since last year, propelled by the investigations of student journalists.
In April 2024, it appeared temporarily that the students had prevailed. A headline in the Kansas Reflector offered: “How student journalists fought a Kansas district over spyware and won.”
Since then, the concessions made by the school district didn’t solve the free expression issues.
In one instance detailed in the complaint, a student journalist describes how she did not receive an email containing an open records request from USD 497. The topic of the open records request: Gaggle.
Why didn’t she receive the email from within the school district? Because, the complaint claims, “Gaggle had flagged and seized (her) emails, such that they were never received” until her teacher was copied.
“Like the fox guarding the henhouse, Gaggle prevents parties from learning about how and when it operates,” the complaint reads, in describing the incident.
Rosenthal said having student journalists as clients has made filing the complaint “exponentially easier.”
“Everything is documented and verified in the complaint itself,” Rosenthal said. “We cite their reporting.”
The consequences of the lawsuit promise to ripple beyond our state. Gaggle’s website says more than 1,500 school districts use its surveillance software.
“This is not just about Lawrence USD 497,” Rosenthal said. “Lawrence, in this whole scheme, is the canary in the coal mine. Gaggle or similar platforms are being adopted in school systems across the country, often quietly, often without public debates, and often without legal review. So we took this case in part because it has the ability to set an important national precedent.”
As a parent of a high school student, I considered what my son’s academic life would look like at a school with Gaggle — the school described by Lawrence students in the lawsuit.
It’s a school where universal digital surveillance leads to clumsy, if any, intervention. A school where student journalists are stifled from independent reporting. A school where taxpayer dollars flow to a company that hovers over student creative work. A school where students are united not just by the hallways but by a sense that Big Brother is watching.
That is a school hallway I don’t want my student walking down.

With the start of another high school football season around the corner, a long-simmering dispute has heated up: prayers at games.
Kennedy v. Bremerton, the case of a high school football coach praying on the field after games, has been in the spotlight since the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling. But another football controversy first emerged in 2015, when two Christian schools in Florida made it to the state championships. The games were run by the state’s high school athletic association, a government body.
Association officials barred the teams from conducting a joint prayer over the loudspeaker at the public stadium before kickoff. Allowing a prayer, they said, would violate federal and constitutional law. The First Amendment’s establishment clause forbids the government from establishing an official religion, from giving preference to a specific religion and from giving favor to or disfavoring religion in general.
Officials at one of the schools, Cambridge Christian, filed suit, arguing that banning the prayer violated its right to free speech and to the free exercise of religion. Lower courts entered orders in the association’s favor, but attorneys for the school petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case.
As a faculty member who teaches and researches law relating to religion and education, I believe the justices are likely to take the case – and that its outcome could be consequential. I say this because the Supreme Court’s recent record in First Amendment cases has been more friendly to religious plaintiffs than ever in its history.
 Government speech

Following multiple rounds of litigation, Cambridge Christian School v. Florida High School Athletic Association reached a federal appeals court in September 2024. The 11th Circuit unanimously affirmed an order upholding the association’s policy not to allow prayer over the public address system.
The 11th Circuit based its findings in its view that prayer would be a form of “government speech”: that it would be perceived as representing the state association, not just the Christian schools. While the First Amendment limits the government’s ability to regulate private speech, the government is free to regulate its own speech.
Therefore, the court held that association officials did not violate the school’s right to free speech or free exercise of religion.
In part, the 11th Circuit relied on a similar Supreme Court case from 2000, which also examined prayer at a high school football game: Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe.
In the Santa Fe ruling, the justices invalidated a board’s policy of allowing prayer over the public-address system “by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty.” Such a policy violated the First Amendment’s establishment clause, they determined, because “an objective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her school’s seal of approval.”

 Endorsement test

According to reasoning known as the “endorsement test,” a message violates the establishment clause if someone listening would reasonably assume that the government is endorsing religion. This test originated in Lynch v. Donnelly, a 1984 dispute over a public Christmas display in a Rhode Island park owned by a nonprofit.
Recently, however, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the endorsement test – potentially strengthening Cambridge Christian’s case. The court rejected it and a similar set of criteria, called the “Lemon test,” in another football-related case, 2022’s Kennedy v. Bremerton School District.
The majority opinion upheld the right of a football coach in a public high school, Joseph Kennedy, to pray silently on the field at the end of games. The justices explained that the establishment clause does not “require the government to single out private religious speech for special disfavor,” adding that the court “long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot.”
The Lemon test“ was the standard the Supreme Court had used since 1971 to evaluate interactions between the government and religion. Under Lemon, there were three key criteria for whether a law or government speech violated the establishment clause. To be permitted, a governmental action must have a secular purpose, and its main effect cannot either advance or inhibit religion. Lastly, the action “must not foster ‘an excessive government entanglement with religion.‘”
In Bremerton, repudiating Lemon, the justices declared that courts should instead assess establishment clause claims based on “historical practices and understandings.”
If the Supreme Court agrees to hear Cambridge Christian’s appeal, the justices will face two issues. The first is whether communal prayer over a loudspeaker before a state athletic association game is indeed government speech – especially because officials permitted a wide array of nonreligious private speech over the loudspeaker. The second issue is whether the endorsement factor of the government-speech doctrine revives the endorsement test.
 Recent record

If the justices agree to hear Cambridge Christian, it must be viewed against the court’s recent history in disputes over religion. The majority has often been friendly toward religious plaintiffs in cases under both religion clauses of the Constitution: establishment and free exercise.
In recent years, for example, the justices allowed aid to faith-based school students, found that a board could not prevent Kennedy from praying silently on the field after games, and granted employees time off to worship.
Two important issues remain to be seen: first, whether the justices will continue expanding the boundaries of religious freedom; and second, whether Cambridge Christian will generate such a result.
Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules – and whether it does rule – Florida has already adopted a law requiring athletic associations to allow participating high schools “to make brief opening remarks, if requested … using the public address system at the event.”
Come fall 2025, the Supreme Court will decide whether to hear the case. If so, its judgment may clarify whether private speech using public PA systems becomes governmental speech. Because the 11th Circuit relied on the endorsement test that the Supreme Court expressly repudiated, it seems likely that the justices will hear the appeal and rule in Cambridge Christian’s favor.
If the court does agree to review Cambridge Christian, it may well expand the parameters of religious expression in public – not just at football games.

A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring those with account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
Bill would add protections for children used as content by social media influencers

The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
 40 million subscribers

Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Social media experts are skeptical about the power of new state laws

Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
 States step in

In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”










In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections.


– Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich


This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.

A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.

Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

(Rendering courtesy US Wind)Ocean City is pursuing every avenue in its ongoing fight to block an offshore wind farm — including one avenue that didn’t appear to exist until a month ago.
That’s when the Environmental Protection Agency told the state that it erred when it said appeals of the air quality permit it granted for the US Wind project could only be challenged in court. The proper venue is the agency’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB), said the EPA, which ordered the state to rewrite its notice.
State officials refused and have challenged the EPA claim, as has US Wind, the developer behind the Ocean City project. Local environmental attorneys said the move appears to be an attempt by Trump’s EPA to “figure out ways to undercut what the Biden administration did,” by muddying the waters about how an appeal should proceed.
Ocean City’s attorneys “felt that the correct location was the EPA environmental appeals board” and filed its appeal there, said City Manager Terry McGean in a statement. But it filed in Worcester County Circuit Court, too, just in case.
“In order to make sure our appeal was not thrown out based on a procedural issue, we filed in both places. Apparently the EPA agreed with us,” McGean wrote.
It’s the latest twist in a long-running battle over the project, which calls for construction of 121 wind turbines about 10 miles off the Delmarva coast. When complete, the project could generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power up to 718,000 homes, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
The project has the backing of the Moore administration and the administration of former President Joe Biden (D), which granted a key federal permit for it. But it has long been opposed by some leaders in tourism-dependent Ocean City, who fear the distant turbine towers will harm the view from the beach. Wind projects have another opponent in President Donald Trump (R).
Maryland fires back against EPA claims about its offshore wind permit

The EPA appeals board recently took action against a different offshore wind project. In March, the appeals board revoked a Clean Air Act permit issued for New Jersey’s Atlantic Shores wind project during the Biden administration. The board sent the permit back to EPA for a new decision in light of a Trump executive order  that paused new wind permitting and leasing, and required federal agencies to reevaluate their policies.
But, critically, that permit was issued by EPA’s Region 2 — not a state agency.
Local environmental attorneys called EPA’s arguments about the Maryland permit unconventional. Typically, a challenge to an air pollution permit issued by MDE would be filed in court in the county where the project is proposed, they said.
“I am a bit baffled by EPA’s assertion,” said Jon Mueller, director of the Environmental Law Clinic at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey School of Law, who said the administration may simply be looking for a way to block a Biden-era project.
“I’ve never seen it say you’ve got to go through the EAB before — unless there was some clear statutory requirement,” Mueller said.
In a previous statement to Maryland Matters, an EPA spokesperson criticized Maryland for not complying with its directive to reissue the air permit with instructions for appellants to go to the Environmental Appeals Board.
“They don’t seem to care about complying with legal requirements,” an EPA spokesperson said about MDE.
The appeals board is a three-judge panel that reviews permitting disputes involving federal statutes like the Clean Air Act. Members are appointed by the EPA administrator, to consider appeals on their behalf, but the board is “impartial” and “independent from all other agency components” outside the office of the administrator, according to its website.
The EAB is still considering whether it has jurisdiction to review the MDE-issued air permit for the Ocean City project. In an order issued Monday, the board required the EPA’s general counsel to chime in by Aug. 18.
Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey, regional EPA administrator for the mid-Atlantic, told Maryland on July 7 that it needed to defer to the EAB. That same day, Ocean City filed its appeal with the EAB, making arguments similar argument to Trump’s EPA.

The city’s attorney, Nancie Marzulla, wrote that EPA delegated authority to MDE to issue the Clean Air Act permit, but the federal agency “retains oversight” over the permit, in part because it covers a project on the outer continental shelf, a “federal enclave,” Marzulla wrote.
Both of Ocean City’s filings — in court and before the appeals board — challenge MDE’s construction permit on several grounds, arguing that MDE failed to consider alternatives for the offshore wind project, issued the permit late and relied on uncertain emissions estimates for construction vessels, among other faults.
US Wind believes that the town’s appeal is “less about air quality and more about the very existence of the Project,” wrote Toyja E. Kelley, Sr., an attorney for the company, in a filing before the appeals board. “Be that as it may, Petitioners have a right to challenge the MDE Permit, but only in the forum legally authorized to hear them out: a Maryland Circuit Court.”
Liz Burdock, president and CEO of Oceantic Network, a trade group supporting offshore wind development, agreed with US Wind, saying in a statement that she has “full confidence” in Maryland’s permit — and the state’s appeals process.
MDE “issued the permit for US Wind after a lengthy, well-documented, science-based approach that followed years of precedent and included US EPA Region 3 every step of the way,” Burdock wrote.
In its filing with the EPA board, the Baltimore-based wind developer contended that MDE followed the rules when it issued the air permit. It also argued that the air emissions tied to the project will occur “almost exclusively” during the construction and commissioning phase, thanks to engines aboard construction vessels and diesel generators on the offshore substations before they are connected to the electrical grid.
The turbines themselves “will generate no air emissions,” US Wind wrote, “and in fact will displace electricity that would otherwise be generated by fossil fuel powered sources that have historically created significantly more air emissions.”
In its filing with the appeals board, MDE wrote that EAB lacks jurisdiction based on past precedent, and Ocean City’s petition misconstrues federal law. It warned that an “improvident grant of jurisdiction could result in conflicting judicial rulings given the Petitioners concurrent filing currently proceeding in the Maryland courts.”
Why are farmers so concerned about solar legislation passed in Maryland this year?

Phil Federico, a Maryland environmental attorney who handles class action suits related to groundwater and air pollution, said he also found it strange that EPA was arguing the wind permit should go to its appeals board.
“It’s a novel argument,” Federico said. “And I think they’re relying heavily on the fact that the Clean Air Act permits the EPA to delegate authority to the state to issue Clean Air Act permits.”
Federico said it seems as though the federal agency, having already delegated authority to Maryland to enact Clean Air Act permits on the outer continental shelf, is now moving the goalposts.
“If you’re going to delegate this authority to MDE, and they do issue a Clean Air Act permit consistent with the EPA standards, then I don’t see the problem,” Federico said. “My guess is this is probably — to some degree — being impacted by political preference.”
In its filing, MDE also argued that many of Ocean City’s contentions were not brought forward during the public comment period, making them ineligible subjects for an appeal.
The state still countered each deficiency cited by Ocean City, arguing that it was allowed to rely on previous alternative analyses conducted by the U.S. Department of the Interior, that its vessel emissions estimates were sound and that the permit underwent ample public comment.
Responding to the contention that the appeals board should overturn the permit because it was issued after a statutory deadline, MDE argued that would be an “absurd” remedy, since the deadline was set to protect permit applicants from a never-ending review process.
“A contrary ruling would allow an agency to avoid ever having to make a decision,” reads MDE’s filing.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-at-5.53.33-PM-1024x682.png,,,2025-08-08 02:57:09.491407

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Editor’s note: Today and tomorrow, Maryland Matters offers a preview of the newest edition of the Almanac of American Politics, the classic political reference book for political junkies.
For more than five decades, the Almanac of American Politics has set the standard for political reference books. In September, the Almanac will be publishing its 2026 edition, with more than 2,000 pages offering fully updated chapters on all 435 House members and their districts, all 100 senators, all 50 states and governors, and much more.
Below are excerpts from the new chapters in the 2026 Almanac on the state of Maryland, written by Louis Jacobson — a senior correspondent for PolitiFact, a contributor to eight editions of the Almanac and, this year, its chief author — and Lou Peck, a co-founder of Maryland Matters and a senior author of the Almanac.
Maryland continued to vote strongly Democratic even in 2024, a good election cycle for Republicans nationally and one in which core Democratic minority groups nudged rightward. But Maryland is thick with government employees, contractors and highly educated professionals, meaning it faces an uncertain future under a second Donald Trump administration.
Just south of the Mason-Dixon line and north of the Union-Confederate lines during most of the Civil War (and the scene of the war’s bloodiest one-day battle, Antietam), Maryland is a crossroads state, with both Northern and Southern influences and industrial and rural economies. This was the only one of the 13 colonies founded by Roman Catholics — the Calvert family. Its embrace of religious tolerance came less from high-minded ideals than from the Calverts’ desire to protect their property from religion-related attacks. Similarly, although hot-blooded Baltimoreans wanted to secede from the Union in 1861, cooler heads prevailed. (The state song, until its elimination in 2021, was “Maryland, My Maryland,” based on a poem condemning Abraham Lincoln’s suppression of pro-Confederate rioters.)
The Puritan impulse was never lively in Maryland. Prohibition was enforced laxly in Baltimore, to the delight of the city’s great journalist-cum-lexicographer, H.L. Mencken. In some corners of the state, segregation was evident well into the 1960s. Much of Maryland’s political history reads like a chronicle of rogues, notably Spiro Agnew, who was Maryland’s governor when Richard Nixon tapped him for his 1968 ticket; Agnew resigned as vice president in October 1973 when he pleaded guilty to income tax evasion.
  The Almanac of American Politics has been going for more than five decades. (Screengrab)
The Chesapeake Bay is the nation’s largest estuary, with water saltier than a river but fresher than the ocean, and with unique shellfish and watermen. Pollution and years of overharvesting drastically reduced its yield, and the terrapin and Chesapeake oyster are rare today. But a continuing statewide Save the Bay movement has had a positive effect. After years of improvement for such species as crabs and striped bass (also known as rockfish), rising water temperatures and an increase in sediment have hampered progress. The blue crab population has bounced back from a record low in 2022, according to an annual survey, and the oyster harvest has improved since 2021.
During and after World War II, half the state’s inhabitants lived in the city of Baltimore, but the city’s population has fallen from 1 million in the early 1950s to 565,239 in 2023. With a large population of suburban professionals, Maryland’s $101,000 median household income is in a virtual three-way tie with Massachusetts and New Jersey for the nation’s highest. Combined, the Washington and Baltimore metropolitan areas have 9.1 million people, easily more than either the Dallas or Houston metro areas. But Baltimore and Washington have divergent histories, economic bases and attitudes.
Washington is a one-industry, white-collar, capital city; historically, the federal government has kept the region going as the rest of the country endures sluggish recoveries, though in the second Trump presidency that pattern could be reversed. That threat has led state officials to recently renew calls to diversify the state’s economy. Maryland’s federal workforce of roughly 150,000 includes many employees at the National Institutes of Health complex in Bethesda and the Food and Drug Administration in Rockville. In the 8th Congressional District, which runs north from the District of Columbia, more than 14% of workers are federal employees.
This has generated a health and biotech corridor in Montgomery County. In 2023, after a yearslong battle, the federal government selected the Prince George’s County suburb of Greenbelt for the FBI’s new headquarters. But Republicans were unhappy with the decision even before Trump won a second term promising to overhaul the FBI and clouding the move, with the FBI announcing in July that it would abandon Greenbelt for a new home in the District’s Ronald Reagan Building.
Baltimore started as a port and industrial city; Bethlehem Steel once operated the massive Sparrows Point plant on the east side of surrounding Baltimore County. The city managed to stay diversified as it spread out into the countryside from its central core at the Inner Harbor and its solidly built downtown edifices. It is home to the popular Oriole Park at Camden Yards (the first of the new-old Major League Baseball ballparks of the 1990s, now preparing renovations), the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum, and Johns Hopkins University, with its Georgian buildings along the affluent corridor that runs directly north from downtown all the way to suburban Hunt Valley.
Population in Howard County, which straddles the District of Columbia and Baltimore metro areas, has grown by an estimated 17% since 2010. Less populated parts of the state, however, have stagnated. Cumberland, in the state’s western panhandle, has seen its population contract by 11% since 2010, with a 23.5% poverty rate; it has begun offering up to $20,000 in cash and discounts to 10 households that promise to move and buy a home.
In recent years, the city of Baltimore has been known for its more dystopian elements, painstakingly (and prophetically) chronicled by the HBO dramatic series “The Wire.” In Maryland, about 72% of prison inmates are Black, far higher than their 32% of the state population. Amid a scourge of drugs and crime, the city paid millions for harms inflicted by police.

The situation exploded in 2015, when Baltimore resident Freddie Gray, 25, died of spinal injuries after being taken into police custody. Rioting, particularly in the impoverished Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, ensued. A curfew was imposed, and eventually charges were filed against six police officers. None were convicted. In August 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice released a report critical of the city’s aggressive policing strategy against quality-of-life crimes. Gray’s death shattered residents’ trust in the police, and, amid shifting political and law-enforcement leadership, the police seemed to retreat. As a result, violent crime surged, with Black residents suffering the most.
In 2017, Baltimore “recorded 342 murders—its highest per-capita rate ever, more than double Chicago’s, far higher than any other city of 500,000 or more residents and, astonishingly, a larger absolute number of killings than in New York, a city 14 times as populous,” wrote Baltimore-based journalist Alec MacGillis. While the city’s homicide rate has remained high, it has since declined; in 2024, Baltimore had its lowest homicide rate in nearly 15 years, to a level 40% lower than the pre-pandemic year of 2019.
City leadership has been inconsistent: Mayor Sheila Dixon resigned in a plea agreement with prosecutors in 2010, and her successor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, weakened by fallout from the Gray incident, declined to seek another term. The next mayor, Catherine Pugh, resigned amid a scandal involving insider deals to purchase a children’s book she wrote. But Mayor Brandon Scott, a progressive and the youngest mayor in city history when he was elected during the depths of the COVID-19 epidemic, survived a crowded Democratic primary in 2024 that included former mayor Dixon and easily won reelection in November.
In March 2024, a 947-foot-long cargo vessel toppled Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, killing six workers, severing the Baltimore Beltway and shuttering the city’s bustling port for 11 weeks. Rebuilding the span is expected to last through 2028 and cost at least $1.9 billion.
Historically, most of Maryland’s successful statewide politicians came from Baltimore, including three mayors who won the governorship: Republican Theodore Francis McKeldin and Democrats William Donald Schaefer and Martin O’Malley. For three decades, Maryland’s senators lived in Baltimore and commuted to Washington. Until 2014, when Republican Larry Hogan won the first of his two terms, Democrats yielded the governorship only once since 1966—from 2002 to 2006, when Republican Bob Ehrlich served.
In the state’s House delegation, Democrats outnumber Republicans 7-to-1, an even more extreme discrepancy than voting patterns would suggest, thanks to a gerrymander that was restrained by the courts from an even more aggressive version in 2022. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) is the third-most senior House member, and from 2003 to 2023 he was the No. 2 in Democratic leadership to Nancy Pelosi, whose father, Thomas D’Alesandro, was a representative from, and mayor of, Baltimore; the rivalry between Pelosi and Hoyer began in the early 1960s, when they were both interns in the office of Sen. Daniel Brewster of Maryland.

Beginning in 2025, however, the Maryland House delegation includes three freshmen and one second-termer, and the state’s junior senator, Angela Alsobrooks, is a freshman, too, a far cry from the state’s historical edge in seniority, with such long-serving senators as Democrats Paul Sarbanes, Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin.
For many years, Maryland was a marginal state in national politics; it voted Republican for president as recently as 1988. But demographic and geographic shifts have made it solidly Democratic. Although the state was 80% white in 1970, Maryland now ranks fourth-highest nationally for its Black population, at 31.6%. Many Blacks in Maryland, especially in Prince George’s County, are college-educated and economically upscale.
Meanwhile, the percentage of foreign-born residents in Maryland trailed the national average until around 2005 but now surpasses the nation as a whole, at 16.3%. In Montgomery County, an inner-ring Washington, D.C., suburb, non-Hispanic whites now account for almost 41% of the population, Hispanics account for 21% and Asians account for 16%. About one-third of county residents are immigrants. This diversification has proceeded despite the median value of owner-occupied housing exceeding $615,000, more than twice the national average.
In the 1980s, Montgomery and Prince George’s weren’t more Democratic than the rest of the state and were sometimes less so. But during a generation in which Republicans have backed smaller government and taken conservative cultural stands, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties have become overwhelmingly Democratic. In the 2024 presidential race, Montgomery and Prince George’s cast 30% of the state’s two-party presidential vote, well above the combined 21% from Baltimore city and county, and the combined 19% from the Baltimore satellite counties of Anne Arundel and Howard. Once rural and predominantly white Charles County is now 54% Black, 8% Hispanic and 3.5% Asian and has also become Democratic.
Such transformations have pushed Maryland leftward, with even the two-term Republican governor, Larry Hogan, protecting the state’s Affordable Care Act insurance exchange and mostly opposing Trump; he was able to poach support from roughly one-third of Democrats. But after Republican primary voters nominated extreme candidates for the 2022 statewide elections, the party took no more than 39% in any key race, and in 2024, Hogan himself lost by almost 12 points in an open-seat Senate contest against Alsobrooks. In the same election, 76% of Maryland voters supported a pro-abortion-rights constitutional amendment.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)FANCY FARM — Just how MAGA is Kentucky? More pertinently, how MAGA are Kentucky Republicans? And most proximately, how MAGA are the people who will vote in the state’s May 2026 Republican primary for U.S. senator?
Senate candidate Nate Morris may provide the answer to the last question, at least. The wealthy Lexington businessman says he “supports Donald Trump 100% of the time.” He’s trying to be Kentucky’s version of the president, with a candidacy based on outrage — and rhetoric that was once deemed outrageous but Trump has made routine.
At Saturday’s Fancy Farm Picnic, Morris’ main target was the man he wants to succeed, Mitch McConnell, and his most personal attack sounded like one Trump made on the senator earlier this year.
Saying he would “trash Mitch McConnell’s legacy,” Morris said that goal “is pissing off a lot of people, but I have a serious question — who here can honestly tell me that it’s a good thing to have a senior citizen who freezes on national television during his press conferences as our U.S. senator? It seems to me, maybe just maybe, that Mitch’s time to leave the Senate was a long time ago.” After loud boos from the crowd, Morris mentioned former President Joe Biden and asked, “Why is it you all get so defensive when I talk about a man who’s older than Biden, just as mentally compromised and holds the same positions as Biden on amnesty, Ukraine funding and his hatred for Trump?”

Plain talk and cutting rhetoric are expected at Fancy Farm, but those lines didn’t seem to set well with most of the audience in and around the St. Jerome Church pavilion. They had repeatedly cheered and applauded McConnell, 83, who left before the speeches by Morris and his main opponents, 6th District U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron.
Earlier, at the Graves County Republican breakfast before McConnell arrived, Morris was more polite and diplomatic. He said he was “very, very disappointed” in the senator’s votes against three Trump nominees. “I know in this room that makes some of you all uncomfortable,” he said, “but as an outsider and a disrupter, my job is not to make people comfortable, it’s to get results, and to bring something totally different. In Mitch McConnell I saw amnesty, I saw blank checks to Ukraine, I saw somebody who wasn’t standing with the president, and I saw two guys who if they were to get that spot they would be more of the same. Both these guys are puppets for Mitch McConnell, no different.”
The night before, in his first campaign speech before an unmanaged audience, Morris dominated the smaller room at the Marshall County Republican dinner — until he started ragging on McConnell. That brought an interjection from Frank Amaro, the Todd County GOP chairman and 1st Congressional District vice chairman: “Mitch is not running. What are you running on?”
Morris said Barr or Cameron “would be Mitch 2.0,” judging from who supports them — then mentioned his main platform plank, a “full moratorium” on immigration until all illegal immigrants are deported. The impracticality of that was conceded by state Rep. John Hogsdon of Fisherville, who manned Morris’ merch-and-signup table. He told me, “It’s like saying we want to cure cancer.” In other words, as MAGA folks have often said of Trump, don’t take him literally.
In a state Trump won by 30 points, Morris may think he can say the sorts of things that only Trump has been able to get away with — and capitalize on McConnell’s unpopularity among Republicans. Caldwell County Chairman Steve Meadows, a banker who hasn’t picked a candidate, told me the party needs “a new direction,” away from McConnell, but he said Amaro made a good point by challenging Morris.
Folks like Meadows and Amaro once led local opinion that shaped primary votes. Now voters seem more guided by partisan media sources such as Fox News, the Daily Signal and Breitbart, which is promoting Morris. But some such sources have raised questions about Morris’ business record, which he needs to answer.
Morris, Cameron and Barr all want the president’s endorsement, which likely would decide the primary. Morris’ full-MAGA approach will appeal to Trump’s ego, and Morris counts Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr. in his corner. But the president hates to endorse losers or take unnecessary risks, and thus seems unlikely to make a pick unless he thinks he can get credit for the win. That won’t keep the candidates from sucking up to him, and if he keeps acting like a dictator, that could backfire on Republicans before the Jan. 9 filing deadline. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear says he won’t run, but he keeps getting asked. If not, he should find a good alternative. That might look presidential.

Wednesday marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act being signed into law. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court started a timer on what some fear could be the demise of key provisions of the landmark civil rights legislation.
Justices signaled last week they intend to consider whether a state violates the U.S. Constitution when it seeks to remedy a violation of the Voting Rights Act by taking race into account during the redistricting process.
The court issued an order Friday to parties in Louisiana v. Callais, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed against the state over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. They are being asked to explain whether the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
“It’s an ominous question,” said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive organization that follows redistricting issues throughout the country.
The 14th and 15th amendments gave formerly enslaved people the right to vote and prohibit any discrimination that keeps a person from voting. The Voting Rights Act, which was approved in 1965, bolsters the protections granted in those amendments.
At question in the Callais case is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.
Bringing the Voting Rights Act into question makes the case among the most important the court will rule on in its coming term. The decision could have nationwide implications, as it could set the standard for the degree to which race can be considered when drawing election maps after each decennial census.
A decision on Callais  — and on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act — will not come until next spring. The process that put the case before conservative-majority court started years ago.
FEBRUARY 2022: During an 18-day special session on redistricting, Louisiana lawmakers passed laws that redrew the borders of Louisiana’s six U.S. House seats and its legislative districts.
The Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus advocated for maps that increased the number of majority Black districts.
“One-third of six is two” became the rallying cry of Black lawmakers, who believed that since Black people made up nearly a third of the state’s population, they should be represented by one-third of Louisiana’s congressional districts.
Republicans, who held the majority in the legislature, declined to increase Black representation, opening themselves up to litigation.
MARCH 9, 2022 – Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the congressional map Republicans supported. He said the boundaries, which kept just one district majority Black, violated the Voting Rights Act.
MARCH 30, 2022 – Lawmakers convened a one-day special session to override Edwards’ veto.
Hours later, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Black Louisiana voters filed a lawsuit, Robinson v. Ardoin, challenging the map, claiming it violated federal law.
JUNE 6, 2022 – U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick sided with the Black Robinson plaintiffs, ruling the map an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Dick was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2012. Her ruling required the legislature to draw a new map with two majority Black districts that could be used in the 2022 congressional midterm election while litigation continued.
JUNE 2022 – The Louisiana Legislature met for another special session to create a map to comply with the judge’s guidance. In defiance of the federal court order, lawmakers adjourned without approving new congressional districts.
Several days later, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Louisiana’s request to block Dick’s ruling, pending the outcome of a similar redistricting case from Alabama, Allen v. Milligan. The court’s order meant the map Republicans passed in February would remain in place for the 2022 congressional midterms, despite a lower court ruling that it violated the Voting Rights Act and was racially discriminatory.
JUNE 8, 2023 – On the final day of Louisiana’s 2023 legislative session, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a ruling in Allen v. Milligan. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court’s three liberal members in an opinion that Alabama’s map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
The court’s decision put a charge into the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus and Black voters, as Louisiana’s case was mathematically stronger than Alabama’s. Alabama has seven districts and a 26.8% Black population, while Louisiana has six districts and a 32.8% Black population.
“I’m ecstatic,” Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, said with a grin after learning of the news.
FALL 2023 – Republican U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was forced out of his position, setting up a power struggle for his replacement. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Jefferson was viewed as the natural successor, but a key McCarthy ally, U.S. Rep. Garret Graves of Baton Rouge, had other ideas. His role in the speaker drama was widely viewed as costing Scalise the speaker position, which ultimately went to U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport. Graves’ stance cost him support among Republicans in Washington, D.C., and back home.
At the same time, Graves bet on the wrong horse in the gubernatorial election, spurning the shoo-in winner, Attorney General Jeff Landry, for his college buddy, Stephen Waguespack, a business lobbyist. It put Graves at odds with an incoming governor who would exert more power than any other had in decades.
NOV. 11, 2023 – The conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Louisiana Legislature violated the Voting Rights Act with its congressional map and set a Jan. 15, 2024, deadline for drawing a new version.
That deadline was tricky, as both the legislative leaders who fought for the map and the Democratic governor who vetoed it were weeks from leaving office. None had any desire to do the tedious work of redistricting in their final days in office.
Landry wouldn’t take office until Jan. 8, and the state constitution requires seven days lead time before a special session can convene. Lawmakers didn’t have enough time to pass a map before the deadline.
JAN. 15-19, 2024 – With a deadline extension from the federal court in hand, Gov. Jeff Landry convened the legislature for a special session. In just a week, lawmakers rammed through a new congressional map with two majority Black districts.
The session brought together a set of strange bedfellows: Black Democrats, who wanted more minority representation; and white Republicans, who used the opportunity to unseat Graves, who was short on allies and long on enemies.
To unseat Graves in the 6th Congressional District, Republicans had to draw a map that complied with fewer traditional redistricting principles than the one Black voters preferred. The Republican-crafted 6th District lines run from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing down the center of the state and veering to pick up clusters of Black voters along the way.
JAN. 30, 2024 – White voters filed the Callais lawsuit claiming the map was drawn solely based on race and discriminated against them.
APRIL 2024 – An appellate panel of three federal judges found the new district lines were illegal, though the map was allowed to be used for the 2024 election.
NOV. 4, 2024 – The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up an appeal from Black voters in the Callais lawsuit.
NOV. 5, 2024 – For the first time in decades, Black voters in Louisiana got the opportunity to elect two members of the state’s congressional delegation. U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields was elected to a third term in Congress. He previously represented the 4th Congressional District until 1997, when a federal court ruled its boundaries were an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
JUNE 2025 – In a rare move, U.S. Supreme Court punted a ruling on Callais, instead scheduling it for further arguments. At the time, justices did not say what new question it would raise.
Last week, the court made its question known, and the answer could reverberate across the country.
Li said the question posed by the court is so ominous because justices have questioned over the years whether there is a time limit to race-conscious redistricting practices. At the same time, he said, the court’s question is befuddling because time limits to Section Two are actually built into the Gingles Test.
Created by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1986 case Thornburg v. Gingles, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions to prove redistricting dilutes minority voting strength:

The racial or language minority group “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”
The minority group is politically cohesive
The majority votes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat the minority’s candidate of choice

“Section Two, by itself, automatically sunsets as conditions on the ground get better,” Li explained, referring to minorities’ access to equal voting opportunities.
The question is also troubling, experts say, because if the court’s ruling expands beyond Louisiana, it could be a further whittling down of the key civil rights legislation that has already been narrowed in recent years.
Civil rights proponents say that if the Supreme Court takes an ax to the Voting Rights Act with its ruling in the Callaiscase, it would be a reversal of its recent decisions.
John Bisognano, president of the National Redistricting Foundation, a voting rights organization, said courts have never ruled there is a conflict between the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court upheld Section 2 in its decision on Allen v. Milligan, the Alabama case that required a second majority-Black congressional district in the state.
“To comply with that law, Louisiana must have a congressional map that includes two Black opportunity districts,” Bisognano said in a statement. “If the Court decides to now undo that precedent, it would be a head-spinning reversal of itself.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — Medicaid is becoming a flashpoint in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, as Democratic candidates attack President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Republicans mirror their congressional counterparts on support for the GOP megabill. 
Cherlynn Stevenson, a former Kentucky House Democratic caucus chair, was in Louisville Thursday morning to highlight how Medicaid cuts will affect patients in the state’s largest city. UofL Health said earlier this week that it would delay a South End birthing center project “indefinitely” after the cuts passed Congress earlier this summer. Stevenson was flanked by two Democratic Louisville Metro councilwomen — Jennifer Chappell and Josie Raymond — as well as Lindsay Micka, a labor and delivery nurse who was supposed to begin her orientation to work in the center on Monday. 
The Louisville area speakers that joined Stevenson made it clear they hoped voters in Central Kentucky would back a candidate who will “help” the state’s lone Democrat in Congress, U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, from the Louisville area district and a vocal critic of the law, which includes scaled back spending on Medicaid and other assistance programs. 
“Let me be blunt. This is what’s on the ballot come November 2026,” Micka said. “When voters go to the polls, they need to remember their choices shape our community. They need to remember who will actually fight to protect their Medicaid and the essential care it provides here.” 
UofL Health issued a Thursday afternoon statement that said “several factors have changed the health care environment and influenced this decision.” Those include a nationwide shortage of obstetric physicians and the medical liability environment in Kentucky making it difficult to recruit needed obstetricians, along with a decreasing trend in birthrates and changes to Medicaid. 
While the hospital is not in the 6th Congressional district, Stevenson argued that Medicaid access is a “Kentucky issue,” adding that the major cuts will “create ripple effects across our community” as patients lose access to care and facilities are impacted.” The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation says the legislation will cut federal spending on Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion during the next decade and lead to 11.8 million people becoming uninsured. Kentucky, KFF says, will experience the largest rural Medicaid spending cut, estimated at almost $11 billion over 10 years. The Kentucky Hospital Association has warned the legislation would eliminate 33,000 jobs as Medicaid underfunding forces hospitals to reduce services or even close. 
“I think that as people wake up to what’s happening and realize the consequences that this is having, that it’s absolutely going to send people to the polls, and I absolutely think that Democrats are going to have a good year next year,” Stevenson said. 
Nationwide, Democrats are focusing on Medicaid cuts under the GOP megabill as midterm elections for control of Congress heat up. Republicans narrowly have control of the House and Senate, following the 2024 elections with President Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. Democrats have their eyes on the 6th Congressional District, currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr who is running for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat and backed the megabill. The district has a history of alternating between political parties.
  Rep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester. (LRC Public Information)
Like Stevenson, two other Democratic primary candidates in the 6th Congressional District — former federal prosecutor Zach Dembo and former Lexington Councilman David Kloiber — have highlighted Medicaid cuts on the campaign trail. Neither of their campaigns returned emailed requests for comment Thursday morning. The primary is in May. 
One Republican candidate in the race, state Rep. Ryan Dotson, of Winchester, told the Kentucky Lantern that Medicaid won’t be as big of an issue as Democrats are making it out to be. He said he was supportive of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, adding that Medicaid was “not sustainable the way that it was” and needed parameters like work requirements to ensure those resources were going to “the poor, the disabled and the elderly, not for the able-bodied.” Dotson was also supportive of the law’s eligibility removal of Medicaid for people who do not have permanent legal status. 
“I think the Democrats will take and twist anything they can to their advantage, to use it as a sticking point, to do fear-mongering and to get people off guard, because a lot of the stuff they say is untrue,” Dotson said. 
Dotson also predicted that Democrats would not be able to flip the 6th Congressional District and that “the Republicans and the moderate Democrats will stand together.” 
Dr. Ralph Alvarado, another Republican candidate vying to represent the district, told the Lantern during the Fancy Farm Picnic in West Kentucky last weekend that he would like to improve health care going forward and that the Republican megabill would “help Medicaid be used for the people that it was intended for” and make it a “more efficient system.”
“There’s got to be more changes to come if we want to make it sustainable for the future,” he said. 
Alvarado is a former state senator and was Tennessee’s health commissioner. His campaign did not return a request for comment for this story Thursday morning. The campaign for a third Republican candidate, state Rep. Deanna Gordon, of Richmond, did not return an emailed request for comment Thursday.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kycrop.jpg,,,2025-08-08 01:56:14.515022
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-08 04:01:43+00:00,CT Mirror,Expanded paid leave will benefit CT schools workforce,Erin Choquette,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/08/expanded-paid-leave-will-benefit-ct-schools-workforce/,"As of Oct. 1, CT paid leave will expand to include non-certified employees of “public school operators” including custodians, paraeducators, bus drivers, good service staff, and to non-public elementary and secondary schools.","Anyone who has ever experienced a prolonged illness or needed to care for a sick loved one or new baby knows the stress it can cause. Missing work for many means not getting paid, especially for those earning minimum wage.
That’s why Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly passed a paid leave program in 2019 to complement the Family Medical Leave Act – which provides job protected leave for qualifying reasons – with income replacement benefits. Since that time, nearly 166,000 individuals have received over $1.2 billion in benefits. 
However, that law left some workers out of the program and this year, the legislature voted to expand the program to non-certified employees of “public school operators” including custodians, paraeducators, bus drivers, good service staff, and to non-public elementary and secondary schools
As of October 1 of this year, public and non-public elementary and secondary schools will be qualified as covered employers with respect to staff whose positions do not require a professional certification under Chapter 166 of the CT General Statutes. To be eligible for CT Paid Leave, employees must have earned at least $2,325 during their highest earning quarter within the base period (the first four of the five most recently completed quarters) and have been employed by a covered employer within the 12 weeks immediately before their claim begins. 
As newly covered employers, schools will be required to register with the CT Paid Leave Authority, deduct the 0.5% contributions from covered employees’ wages and remit those contributions to the CT Paid Leave Authority quarterly.
This expansion is great news for Connecticut workers. Research from state programs shows that for young children, paid leave provides time to develop a strong bond with parents during the first months of life, increases rates and length of breastfeeding, supports fathers’ involvement in care for their new child, improves rates of on-time vaccination, reduces infant hospital admissions, and reduces probabilities of having ADHD, hearing problems or recurrent ear infections. 
Paid leave may also help prevent child maltreatment by reducing risk factors, such as family and maternal stress and depression. Paid leave reduces the odds of a new mother experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression and is associated with improvements in new mothers’ health. State paid leave programs improve the labor force participation of family caregivers, reduce the likelihood that new mothers would fall into poverty and increase household incomes, and mean working people are significantly less likely to use SNAP or other public support programs in the year after a child’s birth.
Paid leave programs also help employers recruit and retain workers. According to research conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, paid leave “leads to an improvement in employers’ rating of their ease of handling long employee absences, concentrated in the first policy year and among firms with 50-99 employees.” They observed high employer ratings of employee performance in areas like attendance, commitment, cooperation, productivity, and teamwork. Additionally, a study from Stanford’s Institute for Economic Policy Research didn’t “find any evidence of adverse effects on employers.”
We estimate that approximately 30,000 new workers will be able to participate in the paid leave program as a result of this expansion. Paraprofessionals, custodians, food service workers, and bus drivers provide essential services to students, parents and schools and now they too can focus on healing from their own serious illness or injury, serving as a caregiver for a family member in their time of need or bonding with a new child without risking their economic security.

NOAA announced the keel-laying ceremony, scheduled for Aug. 14, by email.
The Surveyor is expected to be finished in 2027, and its sister ship, the Navigator, is expected to be finished in 2028.
NOAA operates a fleet of 15 charting, mapping and fisheries ships using an unarmed officer corps like a scientific version of the U.S. military. The Surveyor and Navigator will be used primarily for ocean mapping and nautical charting.
Two other deep-sea ships, the Oceanographer and Discoverer, are also under construction and are expected to be complete in 2026. 
All four ships are part of an ongoing effort to keep the NOAA fleet afloat; as of 2023, the fleet’s average age was 30 years old, and six of the fleet’s current ships are expected to reach the end of their service life by 2030. 
The ships will be built by Thoma-Sea Marine Constructors in Houma, Louisiana, under a $624.6 million contract that would allow NOAA to construct two more ships if funding is available.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-2.jpg,,,2025-08-07 23:56:29.009024

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.The union representing more than 1,400 service workers across the University of Minnesota’s five campuses filed an intent to strike on Thursday as negotiations stall over wages and health care costs.
Teamsters Local 320 said 97% of cooks, groundskeepers, truck drivers, custodians and other unionized service workers voted to authorize a strike last month and could walk off the job as soon as Aug. 20, raising the prospect of major disruptions to campus operations as students return for the fall semester.
“Our pay isn’t keeping up with inflation and many of us are forced to work multiple jobs,” said Christy O’Connor, a 26-year senior building and grounds worker in a statement.
The university has proposed raising workers’ health care costs by 10%, which would eat away much of the 4.5% wage increase proposed by the university over the next three years, according to the union. The Teamsters’ latest proposal is 17% raises over three years.
A spokesperson for the University of Minnesota said they are bargaining in good faith but higher education faces significant financial headwinds.
“The university is not immune to those challenges,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement. “The university has plans in place should a strike occur and is fully committed to minimizing any disruption this action might cause for our students, faculty, staff, and community.”
The university also wants to be able to bypass seniority and pay new hires higher wages than current staff in the same position, a nonstarter for the union. The university turned to gig workers in the past to fill open dining services positions, paying people with no experience 35% more per hour than full-time staff with years of service.
Also at issue is the company that runs the university’s food service operations, Chartwells Higher Ed. The union alleges the company’s supervisors have harassed and unfairly disciplined rank-and-file workers, who are managed by Chartwells but employed by the university.
Chartwells did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“UMN’s workers should not be facing systemic poverty and racial disparities driven by the university’s own policies. With a $6 billion endowment and $71 million budget surplus, UMN should be dismantling inequity, not reinforcing it,” said Brian Aldes, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 320, in a statement.
Service workers at the university also authorized a strike three years ago, but called it off after reaching an agreement that raised the minimum hourly wage from $15 to $20.
In announcing their intention to strike, the union boasted of its large strike fund that would allow its members, many who live paycheck-to-paycheck, to forgo wages and walk the picket line in the event of a protracted strike. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters approved enhanced strikes benefits for University of Minnesota members of $1,000 per week, which exceeds the weekly pay of many members, the union said.
The intent to strike filing triggers a 10-day cooling off period during which the two sides must negotiate in sessions facilitated by the Bureau of Mediation Services.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/P1116701-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 22:56:20.920634

But it remains responsible for cleanup of a pair of old North Slope exploration sites. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)BP stopped producing oil in Alaska in 2020 after selling all its remaining assets to Hilcorp, but the energy giant still has some unfinished business in the state: cleanup and closure of two old oil-exploration sites.
The company is responsible for plugging and abandoning a well drilled in 1963 at a site 91 miles southwest of Deadhorse, according to state records. The company applied to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources in July for an off-road travel permit to complete the work.
BP itself did not drill the well, identified by the state as Gubik 1. It was drilled by Colorado Oil and Gas, a now-defunct company.
BP wound up with the liability because it was in a joint venture with Colorado Oil and Gas and Sinclair, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. BP held an ownership interest in the lease, company spokespeople said.
BP has applied for a permit from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources to travel across the territory next winter along a snow trail it intends to construct to access the site. The company has hired a contractor, and cleanup work is expected to be completed by next spring, according to the application.
Meanwhile, BP is completing cleanup work at another North Slope exploration site, said Cesar Rodriguez, a company spokesperson.
The company has been tasked with cleaning and remediating the Foggy Island Bay State No. 1 site about 20 miles northeast of Deadhorse and just outside the boundary of the Prudhoe Bay Unit.
The site is a gravel pad that has numerous remnants of past drilling activities. The area was drilled in 1975 by Amoco, according to state documents. Years later, in 1989, Amoco drilled several test holes there as part of a reserve-pit closure plan, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. BP bought Amoco in 1998.
It has been a yearslong project for BP. The company is responsible for addressing an “inactive reserve pit, burn pit, sewer pit, lined fuel storage area, and cellar drain pit,” according to a 2022 Alaska Department of Natural Resources public notice about the project. “Activities include the removal and disposal of contaminated materials, including drilling waste and crude-oil impacted material and gravel. Additionally, the project includes removing a layer of foam board insulation (geofoam) that underlays the pad,” the 2022 notice said.
Rodgriguez said BP is not aware of any other old well sites that it is responsible for cleaning.
The sites tasked to BP are among about four dozen orphan wells or other remnants of historic drilling activity that the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation is managing. Those sites, on state or private land, are mostly in Southcentral Alaska. Some are in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Several are farther south and are relics of the first Alaska oil drilling conducted a century ago at Katalla, about 50 miles southeast of the Prince William Sound port town of Cordova.
The state’s orphan well program received a boost from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 under the Biden administration. That legislation provided $32.2 million for cleanup of sites that were once located on federal leases but are now on state or private territory.
The state’s orphan well program is separate from the BLM’s Alaska Legacy Wells Program. That program concerns closure and cleanup of old wells drilled prior to 1982 within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC01699-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 22:56:20.920634

Immigrants released at the border are being targeted for arrest when they show up for court hearings. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.
But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) A Utah judge dismissed a case this week against a woman who was facing charges stemming from a pro-Palestine protest in Salt Lake City last year, in what the ACLU of Utah called a “significant victory” for First Amendment rights. 
Liz Maryon, 34, was charged with failure to stop at command of a law officer, a class A misdemeanor, as well as walking in the road with a sidewalk available and disorderly conduct, both infractions, after a Salt Lake City police officer tried to get her to stop during a protest last May.
But the case is now closed following an order signed Tuesday by 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson, dismissing the charges with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot refile the same charges. 
“The police tried to scare people into thinking we don’t have the right to protest without a permit or to march in the streets,” Maryon said in a statement. “We defended our rights to protest by fighting these charges. This dismissal is a victory for everyone who refuses to be intimidated by the growing crackdown on protest rights.”
Prosecutors asked the court to dismiss the case after learning more about the evidence in a preliminary hearing, says Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, whose office filed the charges in the first place. 
“We felt that we could not meet that burden of proof as we went through the analysis post preliminary hearing,” Gill said on Thursday. “The consensus was, from all of us, that this was a case that needed to be dismissed.” 
Maryon was spotted by a Salt Lake City police drone “leading the crowd during the march” near 300 West and 300 South on May 18, according to a probable cause document.  
According to charging documents, Salt Lake police officer Steven Wooldridge “attempted to detain Maryon by grabbing her left arm and instructed her to stop. Maryon pulled away and ran south towards the protest crowd.”
The officer, who knew Maryon from previous protests, according to ACLU attorneys, called her by name to stop, but she didn’t. 
In January, nearly eight months later, she was charged in Salt Lake’s 3rd District Court. Gill didn’t know exactly why it took so long to file charges against Maryon, but said his office tends to prioritize cases where the accused person is in jail, since there’s typically some kind of court-imposed deadline — non-jail cases tend to take a little longer.

The ACLU usually stays away from criminal cases, but because there were First Amendment concerns with Maryon’s charges, decided to represent her. In a briefing filed in June, attorneys said Maryon had no reason to believe she was under arrest when the officer told her to stop. The protest was peaceful, and not deemed unlawful, and “no reasonable person in that situation would believe they were at risk for arrest,” her attorneys said. 
“Lt. Woolridge testified that the reason he tried to initiate contact with Ms. Maryon was because he recognized her from other protests, not because he intended to arrest her in that moment. He did not tell her that she was under arrest or detained. He gave her no reason to believe that she was under arrest,” court documents filed by ACLU attorneys read. 
Then, on July 29, prosecutors for Salt Lake County filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. 
“Cases get filed based on reports, and sometimes those reports may sound much more powerful than they may be, or less powerful. And then you go to a preliminary hearing,” Gill said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jason Groth, legal director for the ACLU of Utah, called the case an example of “charging first and reviewing evidence later.” 
“Police and prosecutors need to abide by what our state and federal constitutions demand, not what they think they can get away with charging,” Groth said in a statement. 
Gill, in response, called it an example of due process playing out. 
“That’s where we get to test out and correct, as necessary, based on the evidence and what we have,” he said. “That’s how the system should work, right?” 
Maryon and her attorneys contend the charges were meant to intimidate protesters. 
“When law enforcement charged me, it sent a message — one that failed — meant to discourage protesters in Utah calling Israel’s attacks on Palestine a genocide and demanding an end to U.S. support for Israel,” Maryon said.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSCF1955-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-07 20:56:35.871200

The federal government on Thursday filed an emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to lift a temporary ban on “roving” immigration sweeps.



The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to lift a temporary restraining order that blocked “roving” immigration stops in Los Angeles and eight other California counties. 
In an emergency appeal, the federal government argued the order poses a significant barrier to enforcing federal immigration laws. The request for a stay is filed on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, so oral arguments are not likely. 
An attorney for the plaintiffs in the initial suit — a coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies — said they look forward to arguing the case before the high court. 
“The federal government has now gone running to the Supreme Court asking it to undo a narrow court order—applicable in only one judicial district—that merely compels them to follow the Constitution.” said Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California.
U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order last month in the Central District of California, citing “a mountain of evidence” that the government’s aggressive enforcement tactics likely violated people’s Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
Trump’s Solicitor General, D. John Sauer argued in the filing with the high court that Frimpong’s order puts a “straitjacket” on agents and “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws … by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop of suspected illegal aliens.” 
Frimpong ruled federal immigration authorities could not rely on four factors for reasonable suspicion: race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment; either solely or in combination. 
‘A racial profiling case’
“This is basically a racial profiling case: Can Latinos be shaken down in their communities and where they live because they look Latino?” Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law, said Thursday in response to the administration filing. 
Starting in early June, heavily armed agents, often in masks and plain clothes or military-style uniforms, aggressively detained immigrants and U.S. citizens using heavy wartime equipment at Home Depots, car washes, and Latino markets across Los Angeles. Agents often filmed the arrests and shared the videos on social media, set to hip hop music. The Trump administration vowed to bring similar actions to cities across the nation, especially in blue states.  
The federal government’s appeal to the Supreme Court follows a denial from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last week to lift the temporary restraining order. 
Multiple legal cases involving Trump’s immigration policies have already reached the Supreme Court, including the government’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members. The Supreme Court lifted a lower court’s temporary restraining order that had blocked those deportations. Many of the high court’s rulings, especially on immigration issues, have sided with the administration in recent months. 
“I think it’s not surprising that if you’re having some wins in the courts through appeals, you bring appeals,” said Johnson, who noted both Democrat and Republican administrations have used the appeal strategy. 
Prior to the temporary restraining order, Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, the leader of the LA operations, carried out military-style raids across large swaths of Los Angeles. Calmatters and Bellingcat mapped out over 100 locations of raids including 15 separate Home Depots.  
After the lower court’s order, he moved operations northward to the state’s capital. 
‘No sanctuary anywhere’
“There is no sanctuary anywhere,” Bovino said after a July 17 raid at a Home Depot in Sacramento. “We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.” 
Frimpong’s restraining order did not entirely stop immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. 
On Wednesday, heavily armed Border Patrol and other federal agents hid inside a Penske truck before jumping out and ambushing people at a Home Depot in an operation dubbed “Trojan Horse.” 
In a written statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents conducted a “targeted raid” at the Home Depot that “resulted in the arrests of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua.”
Johnson of UC Davis said at least the federal government is pursuing a legal avenue to continue its actions, but if the temporary restraining order is lifted, it could cause “real damage” in the LA community. 
“These roving patrols are terrifying communities,” Johnson said. “It’s going to have an impact on whether people are going to take their kids to school and whether people can take their kids to the doctor.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/062025-CBP-ICE-Raid-LA-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-07 20:56:35.871200

Bridger Jensen, who opened the Singularism Spiritual Center in 2023, is suing Utah County and its attorney, Jeffrey Gray, as well as Provo City and several members of its police department, after officers carried out a search warrant last November and seized psilocybin, the psychedelic component in mushrooms.
Law enforcement in Utah County, Jensen argues, violated several constitutional rights related to religious expression when they conducted the seizure — and, the lawsuit contends, they violated the state’s newly enacted Utah Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Utah County asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, but on Monday, Judge Jill Parrish, a federal judge for the Utah District, rejected the motion, writing in her ruling that the county’s claims were at times “ludicrous” and bordering on “disingenuous.”
In her ruling, Parrish also ordered Utah County to stop all criminal proceedings against Jensen and his faith group until the lawsuit is settled.
“The prosecution has already caused Singularism to lose many of its practitioners and affiliates, and forcing Plaintiffs to wait until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings to secure their free-exercise rights would be the equivalent of issuing a death warrant for their nascent religion,” Parrish wrote.
 The Utah Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Jensen’s lawsuit hinges, in part, on a law passed last year codifying federal religious freedom practices.
In 2024, the Utah Legislature passed SB150, which prohibits a government from “burdening” a person’s right to exercise religion — that includes making it easier to sue a government entity if they restrict a person’s religious freedom.
The bill mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, approved in 1993 to allow federal regulations that clash with religious beliefs to be challenged
“It’s designed to make sure religious rights, and especially minority religious rights, are protected 20 years from now,” said bill sponsor Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, on the Senate floor in 2024. “This is not a bill for any one church or any one religion, it is to codify in our code if the government is impeding on someone’s sincerely-held religious beliefs that they’re going to have to show and meet the highest constitutional standard to do so.”
That same language is found in Jensen’s complaint, filed in November, where he’s described as the “founder of a small, entheogenic minority religion” whose “sincere religious exercise” involves giving willing patrons tea with psilocybin.
“Entheogenic” refers to the use of psychoactive substances in a spiritual or religious context.
Religions using banned substances in their spiritual practices is nothing new in Utah. Former Utah Republican lawmaker Steve Urquhart started The Divine Assembly in 2020 which, like Singularism, has a strong emphasis on psychedelic mushrooms. Native American churches, including the Oklevueha Native American Church in Spanish Fork, have entheogenic practices, according to Jensen’s complaint.
 Provo police carry out search warrant, seize psilocybin 

Jensen opened the Singularism Spiritual Center in Provo in 2023, which he advertised as “Healing. Safe. Legal” and “designed to unlock new possibilities in a supportive, legal environment,” according to court documents.
The center offered participants, called “voyagers,” psilocybin tea. They were then supervised in a “private, controlled, safe and comfortable environment,” according to the lawsuit. Jensen’s attorneys say none of the psilocybin ever left the spiritual center.
In the complaint, Jensen says he sent a letter to local government officials, including the Provo Police Department and Utah County Attorney’s Office, informing them of their psilocybin use and inviting them to tour the spiritual center.
They never took him up on the offer, according to the lawsuit. Instead, in November 2024, Provo police officers carried out a search warrant, seizing the group’s psilocybin and records related to personal spiritual experiences, which Jensen called “sacred scripture.”
“Although the seizure of Singularism’s sacramental psilocybin was difficult to endure, seizure of this sacred scripture was even more devastating,” Jensen’s lawsuit reads.
Police did not arrest Jensen, but did tell him to expect criminal charges and recommended he cease Singularism-related operations. In December, he was charged with possession of psilocybin with intent to distribute, a second-degree felony, and possession of THC and drug paraphernalia, both class B misdemeanors, according to documents filed in Utah County’s 4th District Court.
 Jensen sues, citing religious freedom laws 

On Nov. 19, about a week after Provo officers carried out the warrant, Jensen filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing the department and the Utah County Attorney’s Office of violating his First and Fourth Amendment rights, as well as his rights granted by the Utah Constitution. And, Jensen argues, the seizures ran afoul of the newly-signed Utah Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
The act states that governments cannot burden a person’s ability to exercise their religion, unless it’s “essential to furthering a compelling governmental interest.”
Prohibiting Jensen and his faith group from using psilocybin “is not essential to furthering any compelling government interest,” according to the lawsuit.
“The U.S. Supreme Court, Utah Supreme Court, and the Utah Legislature has repeatedly recognized that religious free exercise is a fundamental right which merits protection and that there exist circumstances, both religious and secular, in which entheogenic substances are a public good,” the complaint reads.
Jensen’s suit asks the court to declare the police department and county attorney’s actions unconstitutional and in violation of the Utah Religious Freedom Restoration Act, have all seized items returned to the spiritual center, stop the attorney’s office from prosecuting the group, and require them to compensate the group for losses related to the ordeal.
Utah County filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in December, writing that courts have rejected the idea that the First Amendment supersedes the Utah Controlled Substances Act.
Plus, since the Utah Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enacted so recently, no court has been able to issue an option mentioning or citing it. The act “presents several unsettled, never-before-addressed questions of state law,” reads the motion to dismiss.
But in her ruling handed down this week, Parrish rejected the arguments from the county.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Pete Serrano, the Pasco mayor who mounted a failed Republican bid for state attorney general last year, is in the running to be the next top federal prosecutor in eastern Washington.
He told The Spokesman-Review on Thursday that he was “excited and waiting for it to be finalized.” In an interview with the Standard later in the day, he was more reserved. “I’m excited to be under consideration. I expect to know next week,” he said.
Serrano is the founder of the conservative nonprofit Silent Majority Foundation, which has unsuccessfully challenged the state’s gun restrictions and COVID mandates. 
His potential appointment as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Washington would have to be considered by the U.S. Senate. There are 93 U.S. attorneys nationwide. They prosecute federal criminal cases and work on civil litigation in cases that include the federal government.
The White House, Department of Justice and U.S. attorney’s office in Spokane didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon.
Last month, Richard Barker stepped down as acting U.S. attorney after assuming the position in February. He left to return to private practice in Spokane.
Barker’s predecessor, Vanessa Waldref, had resigned. Stephanie Van Marter has served as the acting U.S. attorney since Barker’s resignation.
Serrano, 44, ran last year for attorney general against Democrat Nick Brown, who previously served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington. Serrano garnered 44% to Brown’s nearly 56%.
In a debate with Brown last year, Serrano described rioters arrested at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as “political prisoners.” 
Originally from California, Serrano moved to Pasco in 2015 with his family. He worked as an environmental lawyer for the U.S. Department of Energy and at Energy Northwest before founding the Silent Majority Foundation, where he is now general counsel. Serrano is also the former leader of the Franklin County Republican Party.
He was one of the attorneys representing a gun shop owner over the state’s ban on ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds. The state Supreme Court sided with the state in May.
Since taking office in January, Brown has sued the Trump administration more than 30 times.
The Western District of Washington has also had an acting U.S. attorney since February, when the Trump administration ousted Tessa Gorman. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller was promoted to replace Gorman.

Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) on Thursday, blasting the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate over his support for President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. 
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel Jr. warned that Trump’s levies on foreign trade partners present serious harm to Michigan’s manufacturing industry.
Hertel argued Rogers was backing an “erratic” approach to trade that is hurting Michigan jobs and workers, with Detroit automakers facing billions in losses due to additional levies. Parts manufacturer and distributor Detroit Axle has also cited tariff-related supply chain issues as the reason for closing its Ferndale warehouse.
Hertel criticized Rogers’ remarks in an interview with Politico, where he said “obviously, certainty is always better,” but “[the] shoe is going to pinch every once in a while, and the good news about the White House is when there’s a case that comes up that doesn’t seem fair or rational, we even call, and they’re at least open to a conversation, which is great.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hertel said Rogers’ comment showcased “callous indifference to the real pain Michiganders are experiencing.”
With a new analysis from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth predicting Trump’s levies could raise factory costs up to 4.5%, Hertel called the tariffs an assault on the state’s economic future.
Both Hertel and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) raised concerns about Trump’s plan to reduce tariffs on Japanese cars to 15%, which domestic automakers argue places them at a disadvantage as they face higher import taxes on steel, aluminum and parts. 
Dingell pointed to confusion between nations on whether or not the 15% tariff would be stacked on top of additional levies for Japan, or if the duties on Japanese goods would be cut to 15%. 
“Businesses need certainty to make long term investments that create jobs and drive innovation. We don’t need policies that are constant whiplash, leaving Michigan companies unable to plan, invest or compete effectively,” Dingell said. “I’ve met with the suppliers, I’ve met with the manufacturers and auto executives across Michigan, and they all say the same thing: unpredictability is hurting their businesses.”
Although the United Auto Workers union previously backed Trump’s automotive tariff policies, saying they could be used to bring thousands of jobs back to working-class communities across the country, the union said the Japan deal leaves American workers behind.
“This deal hands a win to transnational automakers that rely on low-road labor practices: substandard wages, excessive temps, and union-busting,” UAW said in a statement. “Now, those same companies stand to benefit from lower tariffs, while unionized automakers – who could quickly create tens of thousands of good jobs using existing capacity – are left with fewer incentives to do so.”
Dingell noted that Ford’s commitment to American manufacturing, where nearly 80% of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in America, has become a liability for the company, when they should be rewarded for their commitment instead.

Tariffs would have an impact on UAW workers’ profit sharing, with rising expenses expected to cut into workers’ checks, Dingell said.
In response, Alyssa Brouillet, Rogers’ campaign spokesperson, said Democrats have continued to choose “made in China” over “made in America,” accusing Michigan Democrats of chasing several tens of thousands of jobs out of the state with “high tax, high regulation policies.”
When Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer took office in 2019, there were 4.75 million Michiganders employed, with 210,265 individuals unemployed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Preliminary data for June has 4.81 million Michiganders in employment with 271,454 unemployed.
Brouillet also accused Democrats of threatening tens of thousands more auto jobs with their “electric vehicle mandate.” 
Although Whitmer set a goal to have 2 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030, the state does not have a mandate on electric vehicles. Former President Joe Biden also set a goal for 50% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric, however, that goal was struck down by Trump in January. 
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) and six other Michigan Democrats have spoken out against California’s electric vehicles sales rule mandating 100% electric vehicle sales by 2035. Trump also eliminated this rule. 
“Now, Democrats are opposing no tax on tips, no tax on overtime for 3 million working Michigan families, and bringing business back to the U.S. If we want to build our middle class, we need to build in America,” Brouillet said.
A White House statement released in early June accused Democrats of opposing the same policies, but the statement conflates Democrats’ opposition to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act with opposition to no tax on tips and overtime. A Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) No Tax on Tips Act passed the Senate with unanimous support from the chambers Democratic and Republican members.

For prosecutors, grand juries grant subpoena power and the ability to make a case in the absence of defense attorneys — and they can also deflect criticism over controversial prosecutions. 
The post Why a grand jury? Wyoming attorneys opine on Sublette County’s approach to wolf abuse investigation. appeared first on WyoFile .","As a defense attorney who’s built a career on advancing justice for the accused and incarcerated, Meredith Esser is skeptical of grand juries. That’s the approach Sublette County prosecutors are taking to pursue an indictment of Cody Roberts for felony animal cruelty. Roberts paraded a wolf around for laughs after allegedly striking it with a snowmobile in 2024. 
The skepticism is partly because Esser — and many of her defense attorney peers — are locked out of the process. A legal defense isn’t part of a grand jury in the federal court system, or in Wyoming, where they’re seldom used.
“Essentially, grand juries have this veneer of impartiality because they are a jury of your peers,” said Esser, the outgoing director of the Defender Aid Clinic at the University of Wyoming College of Law. “But in reality, the prosecution gets to essentially just present whatever case they want. And it’s totally secretive.”
Although there’s a saying in legal circles that “a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich,” some Wyoming attorneys defend it as a valuable tool.  
But for Esser: “Grand juries, I think, are less impartial than going with a preliminary hearing.” 
Typically, a preliminary hearing is the first step in filing a felony charge. There’s no official, public explanation for taking the less conventional approach of convening a grand jury in Sublette County instead. 
Prosecutor Clayton Melinkovich could not say if a grand jury was convening and declined comment when reached over the phone in late July.

The Wyoming Criminal Code states that grand juries are to be kept confidential. All associated legal filings are sealed. Even the indictment stays sealed until a defendant is in custody or has provided bail. WyoFile was able to confirm the grand jury is underway — with a decision expected in August — via several sources familiar with the proceedings. 
Several current and former Wyoming attorneys reached by WyoFile who are not involved in the case shared their views on the legal proceedings unfolding this month behind closed doors along the west slope of the Wind River Range. 
“I think that it’s possible that the prosecutor just doesn’t want blowback personally for making a decision to charge,” Esser said. “I don’t know what the public opinion is in Sublette County, but it’s possible that they’re very against this.” 
Former Wyoming Attorney General Pat Crank, who led the state office during Gov. Dave Freudenthal’s administration, agreed that many in the community may be against prosecuting Roberts. As a former Wyoming Game and Fish commissioner, he’s familiar with the longstanding sentiments around wolves in rural areas and small town dynamics. 
“I’m sure there’s a lot of heat on [the prosecutor], probably the majority of which is to not charge this asshole for what he did,” Crank said. “If the grand jury does indict, then they’re the ones responsible. He can say, ‘Look, I followed this legal procedure authorized by statute, and they decided to charge.’”

Crank spoke of grand juries being a powerful prosecutorial tool. Specifically, they give attorneys investigative tools like subpoena power that can help “ferret out criminality,” he said. That’s especially helpful when witnesses have been reluctant to testify.
“None of those people in that bar who watched him do all that bullshit that he did to that poor wolf are going to rat off this asshole and then be a pariah in Sublette County the rest of their life,” Crank said. “I’m guessing that’s probably why he [the prosecutor] did it.” 
There were many witnesses to Roberts’ treatment of the wolf on Feb. 29, 2024. The incident blew up, becoming international news, after photos and videos surfaced showing that the resident of the tiny town of Daniel had flaunted the lethargic, injured animal in front of friends inside the Green River Bar. 
A lack of legal repercussions fueled public outrage. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department responded to the incident by fining Roberts $250 for possessing the wolf. Investigating wardens could have issued steeper fines and required a court appearance but declined to do so. Sublette County law enforcement officials, who reported being kept in the dark about the incident, began investigating Roberts for possible felony charges — and they kept the probe open for more than a year.

Now the investigation has moved to the grand jury stage. One reason grand juries are confidential is to protect an individual’s identity when serious charges are being considered, but not assured. Esser, the outgoing UW law professor, said that the secretive nature of the proceedings is also intended to protect witnesses. But operating behind closed doors also has pitfalls.
“I personally believe what Cody Roberts did was wrong and immoral, but I also think that transparency in the criminal justice system is really important,” Esser said. “Grand juries deplete that transparency, especially in a case like this where whatever criminal statutes are being used are not used very often.” 
Longtime attorney Bruce Moats, a recently retired First Amendment-specialist, agreed the public is largely boxed out of grand jury proceedings. Over his career, he only encountered grand juries on a couple of occasions and found it was very difficult to learn anything about them. Even after grand juries terminate, the eyewitness accounts and other proceedings customarily remain sealed.
“You can ask a court to release them, and there’s that potential,” Moats said. “But in my experience studying this, it doesn’t happen very often.” 
There is one scenario where the felony animal cruelty investigation breaks back out into public view: If there’s an indictment. 
To indict, at least nine of the 12 jurors must agree on bringing charges. The indictment would immediately become the charging document and could lead to a public trial. 
WyoFile has made multiple attempts over the course of this case to reach Roberts without success.

BURLINGTON — A Northfield man has denied federal criminal charges that allege he stole firearms from the estate of his dead father and sold them for money. 
As Peter Baez, 41, entered his not guilty plea Thursday in federal U.S. District Court in Burlington, his sister, Alexandria Stanley, sat about 20 feet away in the gallery and watched. 
Stanley has been pushing law enforcement since shortly after the November 2024 death of her father, 68-year-old Pedro “Pete” Baez, to more fully investigate the circumstances surrounding her father’s death, which was ruled a suicide.
Peter Baez was arrested Wednesday on the federal firearm charges for allegedly possessing and selling three stolen firearms and held in jail overnight pending the court hearing Thursday afternoon. 
An indictment on the charges had been returned by a grand jury against him last month, but was sealed pending Baez’s arrest. The filing was unsealed Thursday.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Arra told Magistrate Judge Kevin Doyle during Thursday’s court hearing that, shortly before the death of Baez’s father, reportedly on Nov. 9, 2024, the father had removed his son from his will, making Stanley, his daughter, the beneficiary. 
Days following the death of his father, the prosecutor alleged, the son illegally took his father’s firearms that, at that point, were part of the estate and sold them at gunshops, keeping the money.
Doyle agreed Thursday to release Baez on conditions, including that he stay at least 300 feet from the property line of the Northfield home where he had lived with his father. The judge also ordered that Baez not contact his sister or the attorney now handling his late father’s estate. 
Attorney William A. Vasiliou II, representing Baez, told the judge his client did not object to those conditions. 
Stanley, who has been critical of the Northfield Police Department’s investigation into her father’s death, has disputed findings by police and the Vermont Medical Examiner’s Office that he had shot himself. 
She has called for a law enforcement agency other than the Northfield Police Department to further investigate the matter. She hired lawyer Christina Nolan, a former U.S. attorney for Vermont, to represent her. 
After Thursday’s hearing, Stanley said she was grateful for the actions of federal prosecutors in the case, saying, “It is federal authorities who are now moving forward looking at this with the resources and the integrity that a suspicious death investigation deserves.”
Acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont Michael Drescher declined to comment Thursday when asked if his office was investigating the death of the father. 
Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez could not be reached Thursday for comment. 
Vasiliou, in response to journalist questions following Thursday’s hearing, said he wasn’t aware of an investigation into the death of his client’s father. Vasiliou said Baez, “had nothing to do with the death of his father.”
In an April email, Nolan wrote an email to many law enforcement officials and local and state leaders, including Vermont Chief Medical Examiner Elizabeth Bundock and Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark. In the email, Nolan argued that Stanley, her client, “has conducted as thorough an investigation into his death as any civilian could.” 
Stanely’s findings, Nolan wrote, demonstrate that her father’s death was not a suicide. Nolan then listed off several problems with the investigation leading to the suicide finding, including that no autopsy was ever conducted.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah mine is set to be the first in the nation to take advantage of new federal rules expediting leases for coal production on federal land, passed as part of the congressional Republicans’ “Big, Beautiful Bill” last month, the U.S. Department of the Interior said Wednesday.
Canyon Fuel Company, the operator of Carbon County’s Skyline Mine since 1981, is requesting leasing the Little Eccles Federal Coal Lease Tract, comprising up to 120 acres and containing 858,000 to 1,025,000 tons of recoverable coal, according to the environmental impact analysis. 
The company is also applying to expand its existing lease for the Flat Canyon Federal Coal Lease Tract to “increase the tract acreage by 660 acres, adding approximately 2,095,000 tons of contiguous recoverable coal,” according to the analysis.

If approved, the developments would produce nearly 3 million tons of recoverable coal on federal land and nearly 4.6 million tons of private coal, in addition to the 40 million tons of coal mined over the last 10 years. Also, the life of the Skyline Mine would be extended for 18 months past its January 2032 estimated retirement date. 
“This is a critical step in unleashing the full economic potential of our coal resources and delivering reliable, affordable energy to American families,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess, said in a statement. “President Trump made it clear that we will not tie up American energy in red tape. Under his leadership, we’re cutting delays, boosting production, and putting miners back to work.”
That’s the first coal leasing process accelerated because of the “big, beautiful bill.”



Let us know what you think...


 


The law required the accelerated processing of pending coal lease applications, giving the Secretary of Interior 90 days to review them, to publish any required environmental review for public comment, establish the fair market value, hold a lease sale and identify the highest bidder for coal tracts. The secretary may also grant additional approvals to previously issued coal leases so mining can start. 
The Department of the Interior also highlighted in a news release that the action supported Trump’s executive orders seeking to propel the country’s coal industry. 
“(The executive orders) support the domestic coal industry by enhancing coal production and use as a means of securing economic prosperity and national security, lowering electricity costs, and supporting job creation,” the environmental review says. “They further outline a series of policies and actions to remove regulatory barriers, promote coal exports, and assess coal resources on federal lands, while also encouraging the development of coal technologies.” 
The Bureau of Land Management will soon open a public comment period to determine the fair value market and the maximum economic recovery of the federal coal in the lease area. 
In a social media post, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox commended the action, saying it would “deliver reliable power, rural jobs, and greater American energy independence.”
“Energy abundance means economic strength and national security,” he wrote.

The Montana Public Service Commission will take up a fine amount against the private utility in July 2025. PSC President Brad Molnar said a fine requires court action. (Duane Schlabach for the Daily Montanan)The North Star utility company faces an $86,700 potential fine for failing to cooperate with the Montana Public Service Commission and failing to provide adequate water service — an amount the utility likely can’t afford to pay, according to a PSC staff memo.
This week, the Public Service Commission, which regulates the utility, voted to adopt a staff recommendation to set preliminary penalties against the water utility serving roughly 275 customers in a subdivision outside Helena.
However, the PSC also said the fine is a step toward inviting the North Star Development utility to negotiate infrastructure improvements instead, given any money the agency collects would go to the general fund, not to customers.
Any negotiated order would also need approval by the PSC.
Commissioner Jeff Welborn said the motion strikes an appropriate balance.
“It demonstrates that doing nothing … just isn’t an option,” Welborn said. “But I think that it gives ample and abundant opportunity to the utility to do better, and I think the ball is in their court to … play it however they want.”
A PSC staff member said North Star was informed of the meeting Tuesday to take up fines but could not participate. North Star did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Montanan.
North Star residents have complained about inadequate water supply and poor service since at least 2020, according to a PSC staff memo.
Customers have reported unexpected water shutoffs, prolonged water restrictions and poor communication from North Star.
At least in relation to a recent problem, however, North Star owner Doug Boutilier said the system operator fixed an apparent electrical short within a couple hours.
North Star also blamed residents for using too much water, although the PSC said the utility didn’t have functioning meters installed on all residences until May 2025 to know for sure.
At the meeting Tuesday, resident Keleen Aldrich said frustrations are running high.
She said some neighbors have replaced their lawns with rocks as a result of inadequate water service, and some are even thinking about selling their homes.
“I don’t have a large yard, but I take pride in my home and want to retain the value of keeping my lawn alive,” Aldrich said at the meeting. “Most homeowners spend a lot for fertilizing and to maintain our homes and our lawns, but without water available, it’s a waste of our time and money.”
In December 2024, it issued an order that found North Star should be monetarily penalized for failing to answer its questions in an investigation and for failing to provide “reasonably adequate service.”
Tuesday, commissioners unanimously voted to approve two sets of preliminary penalties to levy against North Star.
Commissioners approved a penalty of $7,800, or $300 a day for 26 days, for North Star’s failure to address PSC questions.
However, a PSC staff member said communication with North Star has improved since March 2025 after the utility changed lawyers.
Commissioners also approved a penalty of $78,900, or $300 a day for 263 days, for failing to provide adequate service to customers.
Statute allows fines from $100 to $1,000 a day, and the staff memo said it recommended an amount that took into consideration the shaky financial position of North Star.
The memo said North Star has not earned a profit for several years, and it has lost money the last three years, including as much as $115,992 in 2022.
A hearing is recommended no later than Sept. 16, but if North Star opts to negotiate stipulated penalties instead, the PSC will postpone the hearing.
North Star residents have expressed frustration with both the utility and with the PSC, and members of the PSC also have aired concerns about the situation.
Commissioner Randy Pinocci said the Public Service Commission doesn’t have the authority to manage the water system itself.
For example, the PSC can’t order the utility to drill more wells, the staff memo said.
However, Pinocci said homeowners could request the Montana Legislature give the PSC more authority.
He wondered if it was possible that a water system serving a minimum 20 customers be required to have a backup pump or storage, for instance.
Commissioner Jennifer Fielder said she hopes North Star chooses to negotiate.
“It’s not going to bring the immediate relief that the customers desire,” Fielder said of the order. “It’s just not. But it is hopefully going to lead to some real and significant and serious corrections to that system.”
Commissioner Annie Bukacek made the motion to adopt the staff recommendation, and it passed with no audible votes in opposition.
Bukacek said she believes everyone at the PSC has “a deep sympathy” for the residents experiencing an inability to get “life sustaining water.”
She said North Star has repeatedly violated its legal obligations to provide adequate service, and she met with some residents in person earlier about the problems.
“I just want to make sure they know they’ve been heard,” Bukacek said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/4592507317832170039-1024x473.jpg,,,2025-08-07 19:56:51.147829

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)Officials on Thursday marked a milestone in flood protection for the Fargo area, with water from the Red River flowing through part of a channel designed to send floodwaters around the city. 
The 30-mile Red River diversion is scheduled for completion in 2027 to protect the Fargo area’s more than 260,000 residents from flooding. 
Thursday’s event took place at a dam near Horace, south of West Fargo. Officials had planned to remove plugs in berms that were keeping the Red River from entering the channel around the control structure, but recent heavy rains caused the river to top the berm, filling the channel. Instead, officials opened gates on the dam to mark the rerouting of the river.
The $3.2 billion project includes $850 million from the state of North Dakota and $750 million in federal funds. The control structure alone used $115 million of the federal funds.

The Red River Control Structure includes three 50-foot wide by 52-foot tall steel gates, each weighing nearly 300,000 pounds, according to a news release from Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D.
It is the largest of the three gated structures on a 22-mile earthen embankment. 
“This has been a tremendous undertaking, requiring us to bring in partners from across all levels of government and from the private sector, but now, we are seeing tremendous results as the very heart of the project, the Red River Control Structure, is brought online,” Hoeven said. 
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong applauded the cooperation on the project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The diversion also improves flood protection for Moorhead, Minnesota, with Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith taking part in the ceremony.
“Not since the opening of Garrison Dam in 1953 has a river of this size been intentionally rerouted through a manmade structure in North Dakota,” Armstrong said. “What is happening here today is beyond impressive, moving our state’s largest metro area one giant step closer to a more secure and prosperous future.”

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)
The project has had some detractors. During floods, the dam could create a reservoir on farmland to the south of the north-flowing river. 
Cash Aaland is an attorney who lives in an area that could be flooded. He said the dam was added to the diversion project to protect farmland near Fargo for possible future development at the expense of landowners who are being forced into the reservoir area. 
He has joined with other attorneys to help fight for fair compensation in the area impacted by the diversion. 
He said the group has settled about 30 cases where the Metro Flood Diversion Authority has used eminent domain to obtain easements on property that could be flooded by the dam. He said the group is still working on more than 50 cases.

Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) says actions taken against the social safety net program by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are laying the groundwork for its privatization.,"U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) met with retirees at the North Domingo Baca Multigenerational Center in Albuquerque on Aug. 7, 2025. (Courtesy photo by Dylan Bonner)Ahead of Social Security’s 90th anniversary next week, U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) said during a news conference in Albuquerque on Thursday that actions taken against the social safety net program by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are laying the groundwork for its privatization.
“Part of what we’ve seen since DOGE has taken over Social Security is that they’ve dramatically cut back hours, they’re trying to shut down centers all over New Mexico, including in Rio Rancho,” she said.
There are 468,030 New Mexicans who receive monthly Social Security benefits, including retirees, disabled workers and children, according to a news release from Stansbury’s office.
Albuquerque has one of the largest Social Security call centers in the country, Stansbury said, which serves beneficiaries across the nation. The staff there told her office during a recent visit that the facility was built to house as many as 500 workers, and is now down to approximately 200, she said.
“DOGE has hacked into the computer systems and data of the Social Security system,” she said. “The system is crashing.”
John “JD” Doran, an American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees retiree and second vice president of the NM Alliance for Retired Americans, said people using Social Security to survive are experiencing longer wait times, broken websites and delayed claims.
“You have no idea what retirement security means until you retire and find out you don’t have it,” Doran said. “We’re trying to prevent that from happening. Social Security contributes more than $3 million to New Mexico’s economy every month — that’s what keeps this state strong.”
Stansbury last month introduced the Hands Off Our Social Security Act, which would make it illegal for any federal administration to privatize Social Security; require Congressional consent to downsize the Social Security Administration’s workforce and offices; mandate that the program maintain public access via phone lines; and protect beneficiaries’ sensitive personal data.
Stansbury said the bill was prompted by the DOGE Subcommittee’s last hearing in which a panel of conservative analysts with the Heritage Foundation and associated organizations discussed privatizing the program. Stansbury is the committee’s ranking Democratic member.
When Stansbury introduced the legislation, she said on the floor of the House of Representatives that the Trump administration “is trying to systemically dismantle” Social Security.
More than 70 million Americans rely on Social Security, co-sponsor U.S. Rep. John Larson told the House. He said it is the country’s “number one anti-poverty program” for seniors and children, and more veterans rely on it than the Veterans Administration.
Stansbury said on Thursday Larson told her the GOP and think tanks in favor of privatization’s end goal is to break the Social Security system now so that they can make the case for privatizing it later.
“They don’t want it to work,” she said. “Really big money is behind being able to take the principal that you paid into Social Security your entire life that you worked, and they want to take that money and gamble it on the stock market so that they can make money off of it.”
Stansbury said she doesn’t think it’s likely the current Congress will take up her bill because it is “trying to dismantle so many of these programs.”
“But we felt it was important to take a strong stand and say: ‘Do not privatize Social Security,’” she said. “We’re going to fight back with everything that we can.”

Greg Gianforte announced in June 2025. (Provided by the Governor's Office)A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of former state representative Marta Bertoglio’s appointment to the position of director of the Department of Commerce was filed in state district court this week. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte appointed Director Bertoglio on June 16, and the Republican resigned her seat in House District 75 following the appointment, according to the lawsuit.
Jordan Williams, a Jefferson County resident and constituent of Bertoglio while she served in the Legislature, filed the lawsuit in Lewis and Clark County District Court.
The suit quotes Montana’s Constitution: “No member of the legislature shall, during the term for which he shall have been elected, be appointed to any civil office under the state.”
Bertoglio’s position is contingent on Senate confirmation, which isn’t expected until the 2027 Legislature.
The lawsuit alleges Gianforte has made three other unconstitutional appointments during his time in office — a claim the governor disputes.
Gianforte appointed former state representative Jimmy Patelis to the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole, which, the lawsuit claims, state Legislative Services found to violate Montana’s Constitution.
Last year, Gianforte appointed former state senator Bob Brown as director of the state’s Lottery, and former state representative Paul Green as the director of Commerce. Green resigned as director in February of this year.
The lawsuit also says a “disqualification provision” and legislators being appointed to positions was discussed during Montana’s 1972 Constitutional Convention. Legislators were not allowed to be delegates, the suit added.
“The delegates’ debate focused on principles of independence, separation of powers, and political integrity,” the suit reads. “Though brief, their discussion identified at least two reasons for the provision’s existence. First, legislators cannot carry out their elected terms with independent judgment, or free from selfish motives, when they can expect to vie for political appointments from their governor. Second, the potential quid pro quo nature of these appointments undermines the separation of powers and sets the stage for political corruption.”
The Upper Seven law firm, on behalf of Williams, first sent a letter asking Republicans Gov. Gianforte and Attorney General Austin Knudsen to intervene and remove Director Bertoglio from her position.
In response, Gianforte declined to remove Bertoglio, while the Attorney General’s office, in a letter penned by Solicitor General Christian Corrigan, declined to seek removal.
Gianforte’s letter says the appointment does not violate the constitution. 
“All agency directors act under the supervision of the governor. Mont. Code Ann. § 2-15-1801 . It is the governor, not agency directors, who formulates and administers the policies of the executive branch,” the Governor’s letter reads. “Mont. Code Ann. § 2-15-103. If a conflict arises as to the administration of executive branch policies between an agency head and the governor, the governor’s decision controls.”
Knuden’s letter said the argument laid out in Williams’ letter — much of which is contained in the lawsuit — lacked “any legal merit.”
Knudsen’s letter then criticizes Upper Seven for bringing up corruption.
“As a normative matter, we find it particularly interesting that Mr. Williams and Upper Seven believe that allowing legislators to serve in the executive branch ‘is one of the most corrupt things that can be done to the Legislature and to the people of the State of Montana,’” Knudsen’s letter reads. “The Attorney General understands that prior administrations regularly hired legislators for civil offices.”
The letter states former Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock hired state Sen. Cynthia Wolken as deputy director of the Department of Corrections, which is true. Wolken’s position, however, was competitively hired — not appointed — according to a 2024 Montana Supreme Court decision.
Montana’s Constitution puts parameters around agency head appointments, but does not mention non-appointed deputy positions.

(Photo from USGS)Coyotes have been a source of controversy in Louisiana, especially where they interact with people and pets in suburban areas. But they do have their supporters, including those with the training and credentials to help heal wounded animals.
These advocates were dealt a setback Thursday when the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission voted to approve a notice of intent to ban the practice of rehabilitating what are designated as outlaw quadrupeds in Louisiana. That label applies to three species – feral hogs, armadillos and coyotes.  
It’s already illegal in Louisiana to release a captured coyote into the wild. The change the commission approved Thursday prohibits licensed wildlife rehabilitators from caring for injured coyotes. The pending policy update now enters a 30-day public comment period before the commission reviews it again. It then heads to a legislative oversight committee and then LDWF Secretary Tyler Bosworth for final approval. 
Advocates for coyotes say the number that are rescued and rehabbed in Louisiana is insignificant, making the policy change unnecessary. 
Tisha Raiford, a state-licensed wildlife rehabilitator and founder of Geaux Wild, a nonprofit wildlife care center in Hammond, said she has only given aid to three coyotes. 
Only six coyote rehabilitations were reported to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in 2024, said Bradley Breland, the state’s wildlife permit coordinator.  
Paul Leberg, an ecologist and biology professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, said that small number of rehabilitations wouldn’t have “any impact on coyote populations or on the way Louisiana’s ecosystems function.” 
Coyotes have spread throughout the southern and eastern United States only over the past hundred years, making them a relatively new species to Louisiana when positioned within the thousands of years that make up evolutionary history. They came after the disappearance of wolves left an open niche for a predator species to fill in the ecosystem. 
“They’ve certainly gotten here on their own, but they’re becoming quite common,” Leberg said
State wildlife officials do not have an official count for Louisiana’s coyote population, though estimates based on research observation place the number between 50,000 and 100,000. 
As human-driven development and coyote habitat have overlapped, it’s created conflict – especially where families fear for the safety of their children and pets. It’s a situation Wildlife and Fisheries is trying to curb. 
Farmers and landowners voiced their support at Thursday’s commission meeting for the change, citing the impact coyotes have on livestock. 
“While we understand some people’s feelings, we also understand our farmers and ranchers having to protect their investments,” said Avery Davidson, spokesman for the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation. 
“It’s a really difficult position, but it’s one we have to take,” he said. 
Amy Shutt, executive director of the Canid Project, said more public education is needed to illustrate how few coyotes are rehabilitated. Her nonprofit group supports educational outreach on foxes and coyotes. 
She argued that, given the non-invasive nature of coyotes and that so few are rescued, rehabilitation shouldn’t be banned for the species. 
“I don’t understand the logic behind it, you know, that we can’t help an animal in need,” Shutt said. 
Leberg, the ULL biologist, said he doesn’t consider coyotes a nuisance because of the lack of harm and beneficial function they serve in the ecosystem, helping control deer and small mammal populations and spreading seeds through their scat. 
Joey Hinton, a senior research scientist at the Wolf Conservation Center in South Salem, New York, said that while human interactions with coyotes tend to get a lot of attention, they are relatively rare. 
Advocates and rehabilitators say this minimal impact justifies showing compassion to an individual, injured animals.
In an interview after the commission meeting, Raiford described getting a call last year about a coyote found covered in mosquitoes, unable to move. She nicknamed it Zelda, brought it to her care center and nursed it back to good health.
Raiford kept her social media followers updated on Zelda’s rehabilitation, garnering news media coverage and attention from the children’s educational YouTube channel, Earth Rangers. This exposure increased empathy and understanding between humans and wildlife, as well as promoting responsible environmental stewardship, she said. 
“I feel every life matters,” Raiford said. “Whether it is a bunny, a possum, a squirrel, a coyote, a bobcat, if that animal is in need, I feel that animal deserves to have a chance.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-5.57.22 PM-1024x694.png,,,2025-08-07 19:56:51.147829

Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, said in an interview he believes “it’s significant” that the Iowa Board of Regents will bring forward proposed policy changes for adoption, though language has shifted drastically from the first to final draft.
The new version eliminates mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion and critical race theory and inserts that instructors can teach controversial topics if it relates to the course and is taught “in a manner that fosters critical thinking and avoids indoctrination of one perspective.”

“I think they’re coming to the same realization that many of the legislators have come to, that it’s just inappropriate that some of these materials are forced on Iowa students,” Collins said. “And ultimately, this is about restoring trust in our institutions.”
Collins previously posted online that the Iowa Legislature’s Higher Education Committee, which he chairs, would be “ready to act” if the board didn’t approve the previous policy. With the new policy released, he said it ensures controversial topics are dealt with “in a manner that is appropriate in the classroom” and won’t indoctrinate students into a certain ideology.
New suggested policy OKs controversial topics with caveats 
The initial policy, originally set to be read and approved in June, had concerned students, university staff, members of the public and Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, speaking out against the harm it could cause, leading the board to slow down the approval process. Board President Sherry Bates announced in July another delay in consideration of the policy, setting a special meeting date for Aug. 12.
As shown in board documents released ahead of the meeting next week, the proposed policy revision has shifted its focus from diversity, equity and inclusion and critical race theory-related topics to not referring to specific areas of study at all. Instead, it clarifies that controversial topics can be taught as long as they relate to the course and adds guidelines for how instructors should teach these areas.
The original policy restricted requiring students to take classes that include “substantial content that conveys DEI or CRT.” The new proposed addition to the board’s academic freedom policy instead states “faculty are expected to uphold academic integrity, encourage open and respectful inquiry, and present coursework in a way that reflects the range of scholarly views and ongoing debate in the field” when teaching “controversial subjects,” of which no examples are provided.
If approved, state universities will be required to implement practices to ensure compliance with the new policy and the board will have the power to direct staff to audit these practices.
Another addition to board policy stated classes should incorporate “opportunities for students to openly examine and discuss the concepts, ideas, and materials addressed in the class,” and student grades “must reflect their mastery of course content and skills, not their agreement or disagreement with particular viewpoints expressed during instruction or in their work.”
University of Iowa president sees ‘diminished’ trust from Collins
As the board of regents and its universities work to come under compliance with state and federal law when it comes to DEI programs and policies, Collins told University of Iowa President Barbara Wilson in an email the university needs to recognize the DEI “ideology” is present in campus culture and send a “strong message” that DEI is done.
The UI last week came under scrutiny of national media and state government when Fox News aired a video showing Andrea Tinoco, assistant director of UI Leadership and Student Organization Development, telling someone about how she still uses the term DEI and how the university could be working around DEI restrictions. Gov. Kim Reynolds referred the incident to the state attorney general for review of potential violations of state law.
Both the university and board said they are working to investigate the incident. Collins said he found another “violation” made by the university in a drafted orientation schedule for the UI’s radiation sciences program, which was sent to him by a student.
A training session titled “Implicit Bias and Microaggressions and IRESPOND Toolkit” was included in the schedule on the document, which Wilson said in her email was a draft taken from last year’s program and not ready to be published. The document has now removed this session, she said.
“I am sorry for this error, and I apologize for the concern it has raised,” Wilson said in her email. “The Carver College of Medicine assures me that they are redoubling their efforts to comply fully with directives from the Iowa Board of Regents as well as state and federal laws enacted to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programming and initiatives. I am confident they will make every effort to ensure this will not happen again.”
Collins said in his response he hopes UI leadership will recognize the current approach of treating these situations individually and “hoping things will blow over” is not sustainable and seek to change the culture that “continues to encourage this kind of behavior.”
“Me and my colleagues’ trust in your leadership was severely diminished this week,” Collins wrote to Wilson.
The UI has “fumbled the elimination of DEI” since April 2024, Collins said in his email, and if incidents like these continue to occur, “the reputation of our state’s flagship institution will continue to deteriorate.”
“My colleagues and I recognize that our legislative emails will continue to inundated with concerns from students, faculty and staff until we fundamentally change the culture in higher education – specifically at the University of Iowa,” Collins said in his email.
He added the university needs to work on encouraging intellectual diversity on campus, and said the pattern behind these incidents “is why there was such broad support for” legislation passed last session establishing a center for intellectual freedom at the UI.
Looking ahead to the next legislative session, Collins said one issue remaining for him in higher education in Iowa is core curriculum requirements and how he believes a student studying an area like accounting shouldn’t be required to take courses with DEI content.
“One of the things that I look forward to having a stronger conversation on next year is really civics education and making sure that we have strong standards when it comes to students,” Collins said, “making sure that they have three credit hours of American history, making sure that they have three credit hours of American government.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
On Wednesday afternoon, a typically routine commission meeting of airport officials was swept up in the growing backlash over the second Trump administration’s ramped up push to deport undocumented immigrants. 
Dozens of Vermonters spilled out of the tiny Wright Room, a conference room on the second floor of the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, and into the atrium to demand that Vermont’s largest airport take a stand against the transfer of people detained by ICE through its terminals.
The commission meeting was the culmination of months of conflict between Burlington-based activists who have tracked the movement of people detained by ICE through the airport and airport officials who continue to assert they have no communication with or control over the federal agency. 
“I’ve had no communication with ICE, ever, on these situations,” Nic Longo, aviation director at the airport, said after the meeting. “The last communication I had with ICE was a few months ago that said, ‘If you don’t move your cars I’m going to be towing them.’”

But activists, who have been tracking the movement of ICE agents and people detained by the agency through the airport since May, have argued that the transfer of detainees amounts to illegal human trafficking because of their perceived lack of access to legal representation and communication with their family members. 
In early July, activists attended an airport commission meeting and presented data they’d collected, which showed more than 450 people detained by ICE had been moved through the airport since January. Then, on July 16, activists claimed their protest of moving three women detained by ICE through the airport in the early morning hours led to those women being removed by ICE from the airport. On July 25 and Aug. 1, activists recorded and shared with VTDigger two instances of ICE agents moving people detained by ICE through nonpublic side doors of the airport and into what appeared to be TSA security checkpoints. 
“Trump and ICE have trafficked over 450 people through BTV airport since January, terrorizing our neighbors and sending them to concentration camps in Arizona, Louisiana, and Texas,” a flyer for the monthly meeting created by an activist read. The flyer went on to say that the airport was “complicit” in this relocation by “granting special access to masked agents and hiding them from accountability while pretending to be ignorant.”

Almost 40 Vermonters rotated in and out of the room that held only 18 chairs for the public to speak during the public forum portion of the monthly meeting. Their comments, both in person and online, lasted almost three hours. Even more people milled about on the second floor, listening to testimony from speakers through a megaphone connected to a Zoom recording. 
Airport commissioners listened quietly and often nodded along. Longo said there were more people than they typically see at the monthly meetings, and they changed the meeting room, with a maximum capacity of 30 people, to accommodate a rotating cast of speakers.
Many speakers shared stories of their affection for the small airport, and their disappointment that airport staff weren’t taking a public stand. Others shared stories of working with immigrants and refugees who were detained, including farm workers who have spent decades in Vermont’s dairy industry. 
Along with activists who had been monitoring the airport, teachers, veterans, former lobbyists and retired lawyers showed up to demand action. One Vermont woman cried while making a public comment over Zoom, sharing the experience of growing up in fear that her father would be deported before he received his U.S. citizenship. Some people called for a boycott of the airport, and others asked for commissioners and the aviation director to resign.

Jana Porter, a 75-year-old Vermonter who spoke in person, echoed many speakers when she called the commissioners complicit in the movement of ICE detainees. 
“It’s time for you to take a stand on this and say no,” Porter said. “ICE is not going to be sneaking human beings in the back door in the dark of the night.” 
The movement of ICE agents through non-public side doors, recorded by activists, was mentioned by several speakers as their impetus for attending the commissioners’ meeting. After the meeting, Longo said using a side door, either by a member of the public or airport staff, was not allowed unless there was coordination with a law enforcement agency. When asked why ICE agents were using non-public side doors, Longo said he had no idea. 
“As far as I’m aware, we have not given out a badge to access any of our doors to ICE,” Longo said. “Their coordination would have had to have been through another federal agency.” 
The Department of Homeland Security, the umbrella agency over ICE and the Transportation Security Administration, does have such a badge that they could have shared with ICE agents, Longo said. He didn’t know where ICE agents went after entering the side door, he said. 
At the end of the meeting, Longo addressed the speakers and acknowledged their time spent sharing their perspectives and advising the commissioners. He said he and the mayor were working to address their concerns after meeting with activists over the last few weeks. 
“We have a lot of work to do, and we have a lot of limitations,” Longo said. 
Commissioner Chip Mason said it was frustrating to hear hours of emotional testimony and that it felt personal to be accused of being complicit with ICE’s activities. He asked Longo for a deliverable focused on the issue. Longo said he didn’t know if one existed, calling the situation “one of the most complex things I’ve worked on since I’ve been here.” 

“I don’t think public pressure is going to be abated until a work product comes forward,” Mason said. “I could quit, you could quit, but I don’t know if we as a commission have the authority to tell ICE they can’t move through our airport.” 
In July, airport officials told VTDigger they are obligated to work with federal law enforcement officials because the airport receives millions of dollars in federal grants. But a recent decision by a California judge prevents the federal government from withholding funds for impeding ICE’s actions, according to Longo. Vermont was part of the lawsuit that spurred that preliminary injunction.
But the airport’s relationship with ICE remains legally dicey. 
According to a memo the airport received in June after requesting legal advice from Kaplan Kirsch, a national law firm, the city’s obligations are “immensely complicated and changing in real time as litigation proceeds on various fronts challenging the administration’s changes to how local governments like the city are directed to interact with ICE.”

The memo emphasized that many of the conclusions in the report could change day to day as legal challenges unfold, but it stated that ICE had broad legal authority to enforce federal immigration law and operate through the public areas of the airport. City action to interfere with ICE actions or operations could lead to criminal penalties, according to the memo.
“The law might say that the airport must allow it,” David Miskell, a retired organic farmer, told commissioners during the public forum. “I believe our brave little state has done many U.S. firsts. We can stop ICE hate here in this Leahy airport.”
The city could, in fact, have some effect on ICE operations because it has the power to regulate the airport, according to the memo. The law firm suggested some rules and regulations that could affect ICE and its operations without targeting the agency, such as enforcing vehicular rules, limiting access to non-public areas like offices or portions of the airfield and limiting the servicing of chartered flights.
Longo said he has talked to colleagues at other airports across the country and they had a shared frustration over interactions with ICE, but that none felt they had direct control over the actions of federal law enforcement agencies. 
Helen Riehle, another commissioner at the meeting, requested more information on federal and state human trafficking laws, and how other similarly sized airports were handling their relationship with federal law enforcement agencies around the country. 
“Right now, airports are kind of alone on this subject,” Longo said. “It’s very, very challenging talking to other directors and colleagues because each airport is doing a different thing with a different solution.”
Longo noted that the airport had begun putting signage on the back of bathroom stalls in different languages to call out human trafficking. An activist called that hotline last Thursday after witnessing ICE agents move detainees through a non-public side door, but said the hotline redirected them to an ICE tipline, according to Leif Taranta, a fellow activist who heard the call. 
Commissioner Connor Daley asked if the situation with ICE could be a standing item on the airport commission’s agenda moving forward.
“I don’t think this is the end,” Riehle said.

(Photo by Nicole Morton/For the North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota federal judge says the Federal Reserve Board defied the law by allowing banks to benefit from inflated debit card transaction fees for nearly 15 years.
The fees, which apply every time someone makes a debit card purchase, are meant to compensate banks for the cost of processing the transactions. 
These fees went unregulated for decades. After learning banks were making billions annually from the transaction fees, Congress in 2010 passed a law instructing the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to make sure they are “reasonable and proportional” to what debit card transactions really cost.
The Federal Reserve Board adopted a rule implementing the law in 2011.
U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor in a Wednesday order concluded that the board’s rule missed the mark in two major ways: by allowing the fees to reimburse banks more than Congress wanted, and by making the fees one-size-fits-all rather than tailored to individual purchases.
If Traynor’s order stands, the rule would eventually be struck down and the Federal Reserve Board would have to adopt a new one. Traynor wrote he would hold off on repealing the rule pending any appeals.
A spokesperson for the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday declined to comment on the case.
The decision came in a lawsuit brought against the Federal Reserve Board by Corner Post, a Watford City truck stop and convenience store that opened in 2018. Corner Post says it has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in transaction fees to banks under the board’s rule.
The truck stop owners ultimately hope the lawsuit will bring down the cost of fees for businesses and consumers, according to court records. Attorneys representing Corner Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
North Dakota truck stop argues in federal court for lower debit card fees

The legal dispute centered, among other things, over what costs the transaction fees are supposed to cover. Corner Post claims the 2010 law said the fees should only cover a specific set of processing costs, while the Federal Reserve’s rule accounts for additional expenses like labor, technology infrastructure and fraud prevention. Corner Post reasoned this makes the fees more expensive than they should be.
The Federal Reserve Board argued it was following the plain language of the act.
Traynor disagreed. He wrote that the overall structure and legislative history of the statute supports Corner Post’s reading of the law, and that the Federal Reserve was relying on minor grammatical inconsistencies in the text to justify its own interpretation.
If Congress had written the statute more precisely, the matter may have never had to go to court, he added.
“When one wonders if studying grammar and English’s oddities is worthwhile, this case answers with a resounding ‘yes,’” Traynor wrote in his opinion.
The board’s rule also more or less imposes the same blanket fee on all transactions, which Traynor found ignored Congress’ directive to make the fees to be proportional to each purchase.
The Federal Reserve Board previously argued that the complicated structure of debit card transactions would make this virtually impossible to implement. 
Traynor acknowledged that creating such a system would be difficult, but said the board is still obligated by law to try.
The Board of Governors’ rule allows banks to charge up to 21 cents for all debit card transactions, regardless of how much it actually costs for them to process each sale. It also permits banks to charge an additional fee of .05% per transaction to make up for losses caused by debit card fraud. The rule only applies to banks with at least $10 billion in assets.
Supreme Court case
The Corner Post case was the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year.
It was originally filed in 2021 by the North Dakota Retail Association and the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers Association. Corner Post, which belongs to both groups, later joined as a plaintiff.
Traynor in 2022 dismissed the case, finding that the plaintiffs couldn’t bring the lawsuit because the six-year statute of limitations on challenging federal rules under the Administrative Procedures Act had already expired.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling, but the Supreme Court in 2024 ruled that the clock on the statute of limitations does not start ticking until a plaintiff is first harmed by a rule. The high court decided that Corner Post could remain a plaintiff because it didn’t open until 2018.

(Getty Images)Apple announced Wednesday it would spend $2.5 billion to fund the expansion of glass manufacturing for iPhones with Corning, a Harrodsburg-based company. Apple said the glass for all iPhones and Apple Watches would be made at the Corning facility.
Apple CEO Tim Cook joined President Donald Trump in sharing the news Wednesday at the White House. Apple plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. 
Kentucky Republicans were quick to boost the news. State Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, who represents the district that includes Corning, called it “a major win for Kentucky and a proud moment for Harrodsburg.” 
Mays Bledsoe called the news evidence that Kentucky is earning a place in advanced manufacturing and technology. “It’s a seed of growth toward a future where Kentucky leads on the world stage,” she said, adding that “our workers and communities are becoming a core part of a thriving ecosystem of innovation and opportunity.”
The top GOP candidates in Kentucky’s U.S. Senate race also praised the move, crediting Trump with the expansion. The three — former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and businessman Nate Morris — have been vying for the president’s endorsement. 
Cameron said on X Trump “talked about bringing jobs back, and he’s doing it right here in Kentucky,” calling it a “win for Kentucky workers thanks to America First policies!” 
Barr, whose congressional district includes Harrodsburg, said in a statement the expansion was possible because of incentives for domestic manufacturing in the GOP megabill that Trump signed into law last month. Barr added, “we are Making Manufacturing American Again!”
Morris warned Kentuckians to not “let anyone else take the credit for these new jobs coming to Kentucky” but the president. 
“It’s also a good reminder that RINOs who have openly attacked Trump’s tariffs over the years, like Andy Barr and his ‘mentor’ Mitch McConnell, couldn’t have been more wrong,” Morris said. On the campaign trail, Morris has been openly critical of the outgoing senator and has tied his opponents closer to McConnell. 
Kentucky’s highest ranking Democrat, Gov. Andy Beshear, said during his Thursday press conference that the total number of new jobs is not yet known, but called Apple’s announcement a “huge investment.” He said the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development has been working with Corning for the past few months. 
“Apple’s substantial commitment is a major win for Mercer County and for the Commonwealth,” Beshear said. “I want to personally congratulate everyone in Harrodsburg, in Mercer County and the surrounding region who will benefit from the continued growth of this longstanding Kentucky company.”

Sullivan has worked for AOC since 2003 and served as Judicial Branch Education Director from 2007 to 2017, when he was appointed director by the state Supreme Court’s then-Chief Justice, John Dan Kemp.
He has a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Arkansas and master’s degrees from Michigan State University and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, according to Thursday’s news release.

Sullivan’s “vast experience” in judicial administration makes him “a valued addition to the COSCA Board of Directors,” COSCA President Corey Steel said in the release.
In a statement, Sullivan said he is “honored” to serve on the board of “an institution that plays a vital role in strengthening the administration of justice in our country.”
“I have deep respect for my colleagues and am humbled by the trust they have placed in me,” Sullivan said. “I look forward to contributing to policy efforts that positively impact the lives of citizens who rely on our nation’s courts.”
Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Karen Baker attempted to fire Sullivan and nine other AOC employees in January. Five of the other six justices blocked Baker’s attempted unilateral decision, calling it “retaliatory” and beyond the scope of her authority.
The same five justices made an employment agreement with Sullivan in December, guaranteeing him job security until the end of 2032 and nearly $1.6 million in pay over that time. The agreement came after Baker, who had been elected but not sworn in as the state’s first female chief justice, entered Sullivan’s office without his permission when he was absent on Dec. 4.
Arkansas Supreme Court chief justice says dispute over her authority could lead to litigation

Baker “was observed looking throughout Mr. Sullivan’s office, including the area behind his desk” and harassed AOC staff, according to a human resources report on the incident made public in March.
On Jan. 13, Sullivan asked Baker to stay away from the AOC offices and not to communicate with his staff, pending the conclusion of a review by the state’s judicial discipline commission.
Baker filed an administrative civil appeal with the Supreme Court against Sullivan later in January; the litigation is still pending.
COSCA works closely with state Supreme Court chief justices “on issues of mutual interest,” according to Thursday’s news release.

Much as we did 250 years ago in leading our fledgling country’s fight for independence, here are three ways our Commonwealth can be a beacon of hope and progress in this moment.
The post Three ways for Massachusetts to lead post-‘Big Beautiful’ bill  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","“AGAIN AND AGAIN in American history, we seem to be at our very best when things are at their very worst,” write Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson in their book Abundance. The recent passage of the misnomered One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 marks a low point, yet it presents an opportunity for Massachusetts to lead through crisis, much as we did 250 years ago in leading our fledgling country’s fight for independence. Here are three ways our Commonwealth can be a beacon of hope and progress in this moment. 
First, we must act boldly and collectively. The loss of federal funding for Medicaid, SNAP, scientific and medical research, transportation infrastructure, and more will have far-reaching effects that could foster a scarcity mindset and competition for limited resources. Alternatively, we could collaborate in service of the collective good, just as we did during the COVID-19 pandemic when competitor institutions came together to share data and personal protective equipment, and people helped strangers schedule vaccine appointments at all hours of the night.  Though that collective spirit has since dissipated, it lurks beneath the surface and can be summoned with some intentional effort. 
We must avoid piecemeal approaches that force community-based organizations to compete against each other for funding to fill gaps as our social safety net is weakened by the Trump legislation.  
Such a fragmented approach is neither efficient nor sustainable. Instead, state government, nonprofits, philanthropy, and businesses must proactively collaborate and strategize on the daunting but essential task of building resiliency and upward mobility so that fewer residents need to rely on the social safety net and charity in the future.  
Though we have a responsibility to ensure that no one falls through the cracks in this moment, we have an even greater responsibility to ensure that our system is not so rife with inequities and gaps for people to fall through, and it will take bold collective action to achieve that. 
Second, we must allocate our resources where we can achieve the greatest return on investment (ROI).  Not all spending yields the same ROI, and we must take a data-driven approach to deploy resources efficiently, effectively, and equitably to mitigate the negative impacts of the sweeping tax and spending bill. Medicaid and SNAP are critical to beneficiaries and to the organizations receiving funding through these programs, but they do not address the root causes of poverty that lead people to need these programs. Cliff effects make it difficult to achieve upward mobility and economic self-sufficiency, as higher earnings can result in fewer benefits, leaving one worse off.  
Preventing negative health impacts during these fraught times requires more than just increased investments in health care. Currently, much of our health-related spending is directed towards expensive medical treatments and emergency department visits, which have a relatively small impact on population health, rather than prevention, primary care, and upstream social determinants of health like housing, food, and transportation that have a far greater impact.  
Insurers and providers are directing more resources toward these social determinants in unprecedented ways to address patients’ basic needs. Though well-intended, each isolated effort adds yet another administrative layer to our complex Rube Goldberg system and further increases our health care spending. 
Massachusetts is already among the places with the highest per capita health care spending in the world. Spending more may seem like a heroic way to demonstrate how much we value health, but true courage comes in recognizing that our current system is broken and in leading a system redesign that prioritizes investments in primary care and social determinants.  
Such a system redesign will require significant political will and cross-sector collaboration to achieve a better allocation of resources in service of population health. It will not be easy, but we have overcome seemingly intractable challenges in the past.  
Massachusetts has led the nation with the lowest rate of uninsured through our ethos of shared responsibility. Yet, Massachusetts has ranked among the top quarter of states with the greatest share of the population enrolled in Medicaid and SNAP, which is a reflection of state-level eligibility differences and also the need.  
Imagine if we could reduce the share of residents who rely on safety net programs not through draconian cuts and new administrative hurdles but through collective action that builds opportunity and resiliency and through smart investments with high ROI. If we can achieve that, our Commonwealth will move much closer to a state of common health. 
Third, we must leverage technology to mitigate administrative burden and negative impacts. Recognizing that unnecessary business regulations can hinder economic development, the Healey-Driscoll administration launched the Massachusetts Means Business initiative and the Business Front Door platform to streamline business support.  
The administration should similarly provide families with a “front door” and navigator support, as unnecessary public program rules and regulations can hinder personal development and upward mobility. The least-advantaged families should not bear the burden of navigating a complex, patchwork system of supports and overcoming administrative hurdles. The application process for Medicaid consists of dozens of pages of detailed questions and required documentation, while the enrollment process for employer-sponsored health insurance usually entails one page of basic information.  
The newly enacted federal legislation imposes more frequent eligibility redetermination and work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP, which increases the likelihood of churn or loss of coverage for those who remain eligible. Technology can play an important role in mitigating negative impacts, a role that could be especially impactful given the state’s executive branch hiring freeze. 
AI-powered tools now facilitate immunization compliance and employment verification. Such tools can surely be adapted, with the necessary guardrails and data protections in place, to make it easier for eligible residents to enroll in needed programs and to stay enrolled. There may be no better place to develop and implement these new technological advances than Massachusetts, a global leader in education and innovation. 
With crisis comes opportunity, and this is our focusing moment. These three strategies would be worth exploring even without new federal legislation, but they are critical in this new reality.  We need not wait for the law’s implementation or the storm of negative impacts to get to work.  Let us rise to our very best and lead the way.

He was joined by, from left, state Reps. Michael Johnson, D-Kansas City, David Tyson Smith, D-Columbia, and Melissa Douglas, D-Kansas City. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)Black leaders in the Missouri legislature said Thursday that they will fight any attempt to redraw the state’s congressional districts, pointing to the courts as the venue where they have greatest hopes to prevail.
State Rep. Michael Johnson, a Kansas City Democrat who chairs the Legislative Black Caucus, said any effort to remake maps is a pure power grab by Republicans seeking to shield President Donald Trump from congressional scrutiny.
“This is a desperate distraction,” Johnson said. “This move by the Missouri Republicans is a clear intent to shield their national counterparts from impending and inevitable loss that would be suffered in 2026 by an electorate demanding accountability for a hostile administration.”
Missouri has eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, with six held by Republicans and two held by Democrats. The seat being targeted in an effort to draw a seventh district where the GOP was certain to prevail is the 5th District in Jackson and Clay counties currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City.
In a little more than two weeks, the possibility of lawmakers meeting later this summer or early fall to redraw the maps has gone from remote to likely. Gov. Mike Kehoe, who would issue the call for lawmakers to meet, told reporters Tuesday that he’s generally supportive of the push but didn’t give a date for lawmakers to convene.
“We want to keep the House in Republican control, so what we look at, what we’re going to do here in Missouri, we’ll work with our leadership group and see if there’s a path or something that makes sense for Missourians,” Kehoe said, according to KYTV in Springfield.
Johnson was joined by three other Black members of the Missouri House for a state Capitol press conference: state Reps. David Tyson Smith of Columbia, Marlon Anderson of St. Louis and Melissa Douglas of Kansas City.
They said redistricting now is illegal under the Missouri Constitution.
Missouri Senate leader says special session is ‘likely’ to redraw congressional map 

The Missouri Constitution directs lawmakers to revise the maps after every census. The text does not grant, and it does not deny, the power to revise it at other times. The silence, taken with how courts have interpreted similar gaps in specific powers, means the courts would toss any new map as unconstitutional, Smith said.
“What’s happening right now is disgusting and it’s outrageous and it’s shameful,” Smith said.
The last time lines were redrawn between censuses was in the 1960s, following the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision that districts had to be drawn as closely as possible in population to preserve equal representation, known as the one person, one vote decision.
In 2022, when the current districts were drawn, Republican leaders in the Missouri Senate had to resort to little-used maneuvers to outwit opponents within their caucus who wanted to break up the 5th District and push the partisan split to 7-1. The 5th District has been Democratic for decades.
The push to redraw district lines is playing out in several states, most dramatically in Texas. Republicans hold a thin 219-212 majority in the U.S. House with four seats vacant, including three previously held by Democrats. The GOP is hoping to add seats to the majority by drawing lines around Republican voters but governors of Democratically controlled states are considering ways to counter the mov.
In Texas, every Democratic member of the state Legislature left the state to deny Republicans a quorum to do business. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said the FBI, at his request, is helping track down the missing members.
Missouri Democrats hold fewer than one-third of the seats in both chambers and their absence would not prevent the GOP members from passing legislation. 
The lawmakers at Tuesday’s news conference said they are hoping Republicans will join with them to block a revised map. Several Republican members have told The Independent that they question the fairness of congressional redistricting at this time but would likely vote for the bill anyway.
Johnson called on those Republicans to resist the new map.
“There are some Republicans, some of our Republican colleagues in this building that don’t want to see this happen,” Johnson said. 
One of the maps touted as 7-1 three years ago would have run from Kansas City to Branson by including all the counties on the western border to the Arkansas line and then running the boundary east to Taney County.
Statewide, Missouri is about 40% Democratic. The two seats currently held by Democrats are 25% of the delegation. A fair map would give Democrats three seats, not one, Johnson said.
Missourians will see the true reason if lawmakers are called to draw a new map, Smith said.
“This is nothing but a power growth, a power grab by the Trump administration to maintain control of the (U.S.) House,” Smith said, “and we cannot allow that to happen.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Johnson-Black-Caucus-20250807-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-07 19:56:51.147829

(Photo by Lisa Phu/Alaska Beacon)Wednesday, August 6, is the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. This landmark civil rights legislation helps ensure equal access to voting guaranteed through the 14th and 15th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Every eligible citizen of the United States has the right to vote and have their political will counted, free from racial discrimination.
This anniversary is not just a moment of commemoration but also an opportunity to recommit to foundational democratic principles, for every American. For too long and even today, full and fair access to the ballot box is being kept from Native Americans and Alaska Natives across this country.
My organization, the Native American Rights Fund, is the oldest and largest nonprofit providing specialized, high-impact legal assistance for tribal nations and Native people seeking to assert and protect their rights. For decades, we have fought hard to protect the voting rights of Native Americans across the United States. We have successfully vindicated the rights of Native Americans in states like Arizona, Alaska, North Dakota, Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Often, we have relied on the Voting Rights Act.
Racial discrimination still exists, and the Voting Rights Act has proven to be an effective tool for individual Native voters to confidently stand up for their voting rights. The act is powerful and necessary legislation. Now, however, in a time when electoral margins are thin and political jockeying is intense, we see the Voting Rights Act itself under direct attack.
Right now, NARF is working on a case, Turtle Mountain v. Howe. In that case, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a radical decision that goes against 40 years of precedent. The court concluded that individual voters and tribal nations cannot bring claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or under a separate law called Section 1983. With this decision, the court cut off all options for everyday Americans, tribal nations, and organizations to directly challenge racial discrimination that impedes their fundamental right to vote. We, along with Campaign Legal Center and other co-counsel, are seeking United States Supreme Court review of this devastating opinion.
Turtle Mountain is one case in a line of cases designed to undermine the Voting Rights Act. Based on the wrongheaded notion that racial discrimination is no longer prevalent, we have seen the U.S. Supreme Court narrow the Voting Rights Act — whether by gutting preclearance in Shelby v. Holder or narrowing vote denial claims in Brnovich v. DNC. Turtle Mountain must go the other way.  If it does not, then the Voting Rights Act will be a hollow shell, gutted and unable to deliver on its promise of protecting the right to vote from race-based attacks.
We must be able to continue to bring claims on behalf of Native people and Tribes, whether that is fighting a polling place put 50 miles from a reservation, or contesting a gerrymandered map that excludes Native populations, or challenging ID laws that exclude tribal IDs. We must have tools, like the Voting Rights Act, to beat back this inequity. The act has been an essential part of the fight for Native voting rights. And we are committed to that fight.  We will fight to protect the Voting Rights Act and we will fight for every Native voter’s — every American’s  — right to vote free from racial discrimination.
If you or your tribe have encountered restrictions on your opportunities to register, vote, and have your vote counted, the Native American Rights Fund is available to help. Contact us at vote@narf.org. Learn more at vote.narf.org.

Kim Reynolds, right, signed an executive order Feb. 10, 2025 establishing the state DOGE task force, joined by Emily Schmitt, general counsel for Sukup Manufacturing Co. who she chose to lead the initiative. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Iowa’s DOGE task force considers recommending cuts to public employee compensation and tying school staff pay to student achievement, public workers organizations are rallying for Iowans to speak out against these proposals.
The DOGE task force members met Wednesday to discuss some of the recommendations they plan to include in the report submitted to Gov. Kim Reynolds and the Legislature by their Sept. 29 deadline.
The governor launched the task force through an executive order in February as a means to find areas where state and local governments can become more efficient. The state task force is modeled off of the federal DOGE, or Department of Government Efficiency, service in Washington, D.C., formerly headed by billionaire Elon Musk.
Reynolds said when she created the task force she had three main goals for Iowa DOGE: “maximizing return on taxpayer investment, further refining our workforce and job training programs and leverage leveraging technology such as artificial intelligence.”
The task force, made up of business and industry leaders from across the state, has met multiple times in the past few months to craft a recommendations for Reynolds and state lawmakers to consider enacting as they head into the 2026 legislative session. Though the report is not yet finalized, leaders of work groups within the DOGE task force presented 45 recommendations at the Wednesday meeting for consideration.
Task force proposal calls for slashing public employee benefits
Among those suggestions were steps to cut government costs through reduced employee compensation. Terry Lutz, chairman of McClure Engineering Co. and former mayor of Fort Dodge, said as chair of Iowa DOGE’s “return-on-investment” work group, his group discovered Iowa’s retirement and health care compensation programs are “way out of whack with the private sector.”
Public employees in Iowa contribute roughly 30% to the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS), while the state contributes 70% — whereas in the private sector, contribution rates are “almost be the opposite of that,” Lutz said. Similarly, he said yearly health care deductibles for state government employees are significantly lower than private sector employees.
“We discovered that some public roles have developed compensation packages that far exceed the private sector, including health and retirement benefits, time off and others,” Lutz said. “We are recommending doing away with the current defined benefits program and going to a defined contribution program, like so many other states have done.”
The recommendation would call for Iowa’s current public benefits program to remain as-is for current employees, but for changes to systems like IPERS to take effect for new employees.
In response to this proposal, groups representing public employees including the Iowa chapters of the AFL-CIO and AFSCME, as well as the Iowa State Education Association (ISEA), have launched “hands off IPERS” efforts, asking Iowans to contact Reynolds and lawmakers to share their opposition to the proposal.
“This proposal would strip away the retirement security public employees have earned through decades of service,” staff with AFSCME Local 61 wrote in a social media post.
Melissa Peterson with the Iowa State Education Association said moving to a defined contribution system for incoming employees would make the current IPERS system unsustainable, even for employees who would be grandfathered in under the proposal. She also said the change would cause major problems for recruiting employees for public sector jobs — like teaching and law enforcement — where Iowa is already seeing workforce shortages.
“If you think it’s difficult now to find a teacher or a corrections officer, go after their retirement, take off the table a defined benefit system, and you’re going to exacerbate the existing shortages we have,” Peterson said. “And, sadly, I think that that might be the intention of some of some of the people sitting around that table. They would like to eliminate our very good, stable, defined benefit system. Because they, as private entrepreneurs, don’t feel like they can compete with (IPERS).”
Teacher ‘pay for performance’ proposed
The subgroup also recommended tying teacher and administrators’ pay to student achievements through a “pay-for-performance system.” Lutz said Iowa’s education spending is higher than the national median at $18,000 per student, but that the state is lagging in national rankings for student achievement in math, reading and science.
Linking K-12 school staff pay to achievement, which would be tracked through dashboards showing metrics comparing certain student achievement assessments to dollars spent, would be a more effective means to improve students’ outcomes than the current system which “rewards teachers and administrators for their length of service or the duties they take on with no ties to student achievements,” Lutz said.
“It’s important to note, we are not suggesting cutting costs,” Lutz said. “We are focused on spending that rewards what matters: higher student achievements.”
Peterson said linking pay for school staff to standardized test scores would not necessarily improve students’ outcomes.  Instead, she said, Iowa should provide funding to schools that can lessen student-teacher ratios and find ways to address problems with absenteeism.
A similar “pay-for-performance” model for teacher compensation was discussed during former Gov. Terry Branstad’s administration in 2011, but did not move forward. Peterson said this compensation model was not a good idea at that time, and “if anything, we only now have more challenges in a public education setting than we even did 15 years ago.”
Peterson said to her knowledge, the DOGE task force did not consult with education experts, groups like ISEA or other public education stakeholders while crafting their recommendations.
When the DOGE task force was created, she said she was “cautiously optimistic,” as she did believe there were areas where Iowa government can be more efficient and transparent with taxpayer funds. However, she said the recommendations presented Wednesday feel like “yet another partisan attack” on public education.
“Listen, we’re all for it: Let’s go ahead, let’s have a conversation about what we can do to maximize efficiency,” Peterson said. “I had hoped they would focus on vouchers. I had hoped there would be a conversation about what our K-12 system could do with community partnerships, for example, to help enhance some of our career and technical education programs at the K-12 level. I thought there might be a discussion about the value of our concurrent enrollment programs that are partnerships between K-12 and community colleges. … Instead, it sounds like they decided to focus on what I would consider to be some partisan low-hanging fruit.”
Other recommendations include efforts like establishing a “red tape hotline” for Iowans to report and find solutions when they face bureaucratic hurdles, creating new ways for counties to share resources and services, and speeding up the permit process for new construction projects through the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
Emily Schmitt of Sukup Manufacturing Co., the task force’s chair, said all 45 recommendations discussed Wednesday would be up for discussions moving forward.
“We have declining assets of time and money,” Schmitt said.”… This is something that’s very impactful to discuss and really get some solutions out there. And that’s what I heard today, and that’s what everybody around this table is here for and committed to.”
The state DOGE task force is scheduled to meet for a final time Sept. 24 before submitting the final report.

(Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Energy)The U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday that the Lava Ridge Wind Project is officially canceled.
Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said he would reverse approval of the large wind farm project that had been approved to be built outside of Twin Falls on land managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.
The company Magic Valley Energy had sought a permit to build more than 200 wind turbines that would generate an expected 1,000 megawatts.
Burgum said in a press release Wednesday that his office reviewed the decision approving the project and “discovered crucial legal deficiencies in the issuance of the approval.”

The project, which began permitting in 2019, drew deep criticism from Idaho Republican officials, including Gov. Brad Little, U.S. Rep Mike Simpson and U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo. President Donald Trump temporarily halted the project through an executive order in January, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. His order directed the federal agency to review the project.
“Idahoans have spoken loud and clear over the last few years: the Lava Ridge Wind Project has no place in our state,” Simpson said Wednesday in an emailed statement. “Today’s decision confirms that common sense and the will of the people prevailed.”
Crapo also celebrated the decision.
“This harmful proposal by the previous Administration willfully neglected widespread opposition from the local community,” Crapo said in a statement. “I am glad to see President Donald Trump fulfilling his commitment to making sure Idaho voices on this matter were heard and respected.”
Little in January also issued an executive order in tandem with the presidents’ to direct state agencies to cooperate with the review of the project and encourage the public to share their concerns about it with the federal agency.
Environmental groups encourage other renewable energy projects 
When the president first halted the project, the environmental group Idaho Conservation League argued that other renewable energy projects should be considered, especially in Idaho where much of the state’s energy is imported from elsewhere.
About 40% of Idaho’s power is generated out of the state, the Sun previously reported.
“While the Lava Ridge Project wasn’t perfect, we desperately need to develop new sources of renewable energy in order to meet the growing demand for electricity and replace carbon-emitting coal and gas power plants,” the league said in a previous statement. 
The Idaho Conservation League could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Three Montana Republican lawmakers have sued the state GOP, alleging their rights as voting members of the party were wrongly terminated and asking for the party to be forced to re-elect its officers. 
The lawsuit, filed by Jason Ellsworth of Hamilton, Denley Loge of St. Regis and Shelley Vance of Belgrade, as “MT Republicans,” is the latest escalation of an ongoing fight between a group of nine Republican state senators and the majority of the party that saw the Republican lawmakers work with Democrats to pass major bills, including the state’s budget.
The party “divested MT Republicans from their vested voting rights in MT GOP in retaliation for and as punishment for their protected legislative activities,” the lawsuit states. “.. A party without representation from each of its elected Republicans ceases to act as a political party that reflects the views of the electorate. MT GOP’s ouster was substantively and procedurally fatally flawed.”
But the Montana GOP pushed back against the lawsuit filed in Lewis and Clark District Court.
“Frankly, we’re confused as to why they’re upset. You can’t quit the team, suit up for the other side, and then sue the coach for benching you,” said Tyler Newcombe, executive director of the Montana GOP in a statement. “By organizing with Democrats, The Nine removed themselves from the Republican Party. All we did was recognize what they had already made clear through their votes and their alliances.”
The intra party rift began with the first vote taken during the 2025 legislative session, when nine Republicans joined all Democrats in the chamber to buck their own leadership and change Senate rules, effectively leading to a bipartisan “working majority” for the duration of the session.
The GOP Executive Committee censured the Nine during the session, saying they no longer considered them to represent Republican values. Members of the Nine, however, have argued their views represent the true identity of the GOP.
Fallout continued into the summer when Republicans gathered in Helena for the party’s annual convention. 
Before new party leadership elections began, Sen. Barry Usher, a member of the more conservative Montana Freedom Caucus, made a motion to remove the nine senators from the list of credentialed delegates allowed to vote.
Under the Montana Republican Party’s bylaws, all “Republican members of the Legislative Assembly” are entitled to vote at the officers’ convention. 
Then-party Chairman Don Kaltschmidt ruled Usher’s motion out of order, but members of the Freedom Caucus successfully lobbied for a vote, and a majority of delegates voted to strip the nine of their voting rights. 
The Montana Freedom Caucus publicly lists 21 members of the Legislature among its ranks, including eight Senators. However, the caucus does mention its members may include additional lawmakers who prefer to remain anonymous. 
Pushing back against their ouster, the Nine lodged a protest with the party in early July, calling for a new election of officers, and subsequently filed the lawsuit seeking to reestablish their standing within the party and calling for the officers’ election to be held again, with their input. 
“Just as they undermined the party and its leadership during the legislative session, the nine senators never reached out to set up a meeting or discuss their concerns with the party before filing their lawsuit,” Newcombe told the Daily Montanan. “It’s disappointing — but not surprising — that instead of working together as part of a team, they’ve once again chosen to attack the very conservative movement they falsely claim to represent.”
The lawsuit alleges the party’s “rebuke, censure and ouster” of the three senators conflicts with the National Republican Party rules, including allowing the “broadest possible participation” of voters within the party. 
The plaintiffs are represented by Joan Mell, a lawyer who also represented Ellsworth throughout the Legislature when he was subject to an investigation over ethical and criminal misconduct allegations. Ellsworth was censured by the entire Senate, removed from committee assignments, and banned from the Senate floor.
In the court filing, the plaintiffs argue that their actions during the Legislature were constitutionally protected activities and helped push through priorities of Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte. They allege that the Freedom Caucus, and by extension the state party, sought to punish them and the governor.
“MT Freedom Caucus members and affiliates took offense when MT Republicans worked with Republican Governor Gianforte and his cabinet to garner majority votes on legislative measures in the best interests of Montanans during the 2025 Legislative session,” according to court documents. “MT Freedom Caucus members wanted MT Republicans to retaliate against Gianforte for his primary support of candidates who were not Freedom Caucus members. MT Republicans sought to expeditiously approve the Governor’s Cabinet appointments without retaliation consistent with their duties and devote their attention to passage of legislation through majority rule.”
Representatives from Gianforte’s office did not respond to questions about the party’s actions against the Nine and the subsequent lawsuit. Questions about whether the governor condones the actions of the party and his view on the continued division of the party also did not receive a response. 
The plaintiffs further argued their actions achieved “majority rule, which did not necessitate abandonment of Republican values. Bipartisan support on Republican sponsored legislation is not prohibited by the Republican platform,” according to court documents.”
Ellsworth, in a declaration filed with the court, stated that the Freedom Caucus seeks “blind loyalty to their extremist thinking. The tactics it deploys violate core Republican values ensconced in National Republican Party Rules where rule by inclusion is the policy.”
 At the June convention, voting delegates elected Art Wittich to serve a two-year term as party chair. 
Wittich is an attorney and former state legislator who represented a portion of Gallatin County from 2011 to 2016 and served as Senate Majority Leader during the 2013 Legislature. That session saw a similar rift between the party leadership and a handful of “solution-minded Republicans” who often voted with Democrats. 
Speaking to the party after his election as chair, Wittich called for party unity and moving forward “without dividing and subtracting.” 
However, Wittich also told the Daily Montanan that one of his goals as chair would be to better educate voters during the primary season to ensure they know who the “conservative voices” are, and he called out the nine senators as not being Republicans. 
While the three senators who filed the lawsuit argued that the actions taken to remove them violated party bylaws and national committee rules, officials with the state GOP maintain their actions were justified. 
“These nine senators weren’t removed from the convention lightly — they were removed because they repeatedly acted in opposition to the values and priorities that Montana Republicans overwhelmingly supported at the ballot box,” Newcombe told the Daily Montanan. “We are obligated to inform those voters of this repeated failure by these nine senators.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-538-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 19:56:51.147829
,California,2025-08-07 22:05:00+00:00,CalMatters,Por qué una nueva orden de Trump podría expulsar a miles de estudiantes adultos de las clases,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2025/08/trump-orden-estudiantes-adultos/,El Departamento de Educación de EE. UU. informa que los estudiantes adultos sin estatus legal ahora tienen prohibido el acceso a ciertos cursos.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Mientras el presidente Donald Trump intensifica la aplicación de leyes migratorias, atacando a los inmigrantes en sitios de trabajo y esquinas de California, su administración está centrando su atención en los estudiantes adultos.
En un memorando emitido a principios de este mes, el Departamento de Educación de EE. UU. declaró que se debe prohibir a los estudiantes adultos sin estatus legal el acceso a las clases de educación técnica profesional, los programas de inglés y los cursos de equivalencia de bachillerato financiados con fondos federales. 
Las escuelas para adultos ofrecen estos cursos a cualquier persona mayor de 18 años, incluidos los inmigrantes, y muchos directores escolares afirman que la nueva orden podría provocar una disminución de la matrícula. Los distritos escolares de California, desde preescolar hasta bachillerato, también podrían tener que adaptarse, ya que utilizan fondos federales para ofrecer numerosas clases de educación técnica profesional que enseñan habilidades como soldadura y agricultura.
La nueva orden plantea desafíos administrativos para estas escuelas, que no exigen a los estudiantes que comprueben su estatus migratorio. Muchos estudiantes, incluidos ciudadanos estadounidenses, carecen de los documentos de verificación adecuados.
 “Esto va a perpetuar esta atmósfera de miedo”, dijo Randy Tillery, director de movilidad económica de la organización sin fines de lucro WestEd, que ayuda a recopilar datos en nombre del estado.
La semana pasada, el fiscal general de California, Rob Bonta, dijo que el estado está demandando a la administración Trump  por la nueva orden.
El Departamento de Educación de EE. UU. se negó a comentar sobre la nueva regla. En un comunicado de prensa , el departamento afirmó que la aplicará a partir del 9 de agosto.
 Las escuelas para adultos piden a los estudiantes que compartan voluntariamente sus números de Seguro Social, que sólo están disponibles para aquellos con derecho legal a trabajar en EE. UU. De los más de 500.000 estudiantes adultos que toman clases en California, aproximadamente el 10% comparte voluntariamente sus números con sus escuelas, dijo Tillery.
 Las escuelas de todo el estado dicen que están esperando más orientación de las agencias estatales y federales antes de prohibir a los estudiantes asistir a cualquier clase. 
 ‘¿Qué pasa si no regresas?’
V., estudiante de la Escuela para Adultos de Huntington Beach, lleva dos años tomando clases de inglés de lunes a jueves, durante dos horas y media diarias. V. aceptó ser entrevistada con la condición de que CalMatters no la identificara, ya que no tiene estatus migratorio legal y teme ser deportada.
Sus tres hijos, ciudadanos estadounidenses, no apoyaban la idea de que su madre fuera a la escuela este verano ante la amenaza inminente de redadas migratorias . “Cuando agarré mi mochila para ir a la escuela, mis hijos me dijeron: ‘No te vayas, mamá. ¿Y si no regresas?'”, contó a CalMatters en español, con la voz temblorosa, al borde de las lágrimas.
 El mes pasado, le envió una nota a su profesora diciéndole que, debido a una ansiedad incontrolable, necesitaba tomar la clase en línea. “Tenía, tengo y sigo teniendo miedo de salir (de casa)”, dijo después.
 Normalmente, su clase tiene unos 40 estudiantes, pero este verano, según su profesora, se ha reducido a 24. La clase se transmite en directo y cada vez más estudiantes optan por tomar el curso en línea, según la profesora. CalMatters no revelará el nombre de la profesora para garantizar el anonimato de V.
V. comentó que le costaba más concentrarse mientras tomaba clases en línea; sus hijos a menudo interrumpían la transmisión en vivo o algo en la computadora la distraía. Después de unas dos semanas de clases en línea, V. regresó a clases en persona, a pesar del miedo de sus hijos.
Steve Curiel, el director de la escuela, dijo que está permitiendo que los estudiantes sin estatus legal asistan a clase, al menos por ahora, hasta que el departamento de educación proporcione más orientación sobre la nueva ley.
Desde hace un mes, las escuelas para adultos han estado lidiando con la incertidumbre sobre las políticas y la financiación federales. La financiación federal para estas escuelas suele llegar anualmente, comenzando el año fiscal el 1 de julio, y representa hasta el 30 % del presupuesto escolar.
 El Departamento de Educación retuvo el dinero durante un mes, lo que llevó al Fiscal General de California, Rob Bonta, a demandar a la Secretaria de Educación, Linda McMahon. El viernes, el departamento anunció que comenzaría a liberar el dinero esta semana , pero la demanda sigue en curso, según Elissa Pérez, portavoz de la oficina de Bonta.
 “Nos sentimos optimistas, pero aún tenemos cierta incertidumbre porque queremos ver la liberación efectiva de los fondos”, dijo Curiel. Estaba a punto de comenzar a aplicar recortes de contratos el viernes en la Escuela de Adultos Huntington, pero dijo que ahora esperará.
 “Esto va a perpetuar esta atmósfera de miedo”.Randy Tillery, director de desarrollo económico de WestEd
 Muchos estados dependen completamente del gobierno federal para financiar programas de aprendizaje del idioma inglés y de equivalencia de escuela secundaria para adultos, mientras que California cuenta con un colchón financiero: el estado proporciona más de 650 millones de dólares cada año específicamente para la educación de adultos, lo que representa la mayor parte de la financiación para las escuelas para adultos de California.
 Alejar a los adolescentes de las clases
 La nueva política del Departamento de Educación sobre adultos sin estatus legal también podría afectar a los estudiantes de preparatoria. Si bien gran parte de los fondos federales en cuestión apoya a los adultos que toman clases de inglés y cursos de equivalencia de preparatoria, la educación técnica profesional forma parte de un fondo separado, conocido como fondos Perkins, que abarca cientos de preparatorias en todo el estado. El memorando del Departamento de Educación indica que la financiación de estos programas debería restringirse a los estudiantes con residencia legal o ciudadanía.
 Se estima que 150,000 niños de entre 3 y 17 años viven en California sin estatus legal, según el Instituto de Política Migratoria. La gran mayoría asiste a la escuela.
 El caso Plyer v. Doe de la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos exige que los distritos escolares de primaria y secundaria proporcionen a todos los estudiantes, independientemente de su estatus legal, una educación pública básica. Sin embargo, en el memorando, el Departamento de Educación de Estados Unidos indicó que las clases de formación profesional ya no se consideran parte de la educación básica. El memorando también indica que los niños sin estatus legal ahora tienen prohibido cursar estudios universitarios en la escuela secundaria.
Para implementar la nueva política del departamento de educación, las escuelas públicas, desde preescolar hasta el bachillerato, tendrían que informar a ciertos estudiantes que no pueden inscribirse en ciertas clases debido a su estatus legal. Esto crearía un enorme problema para las escuelas, afirmó Tillery, ya que no preguntan a los estudiantes sobre su estatus legal. Las escuelas públicas tendrían que recopilar datos sobre quiénes son residentes legales y quiénes no, añadió, lo que podría disuadir a algunos estudiantes de asistir a la escuela.
 El Departamento de Educación de EE. UU. no respondió a las preguntas de CalMatters sobre cómo deberían responder las escuelas ni cómo se implementaría la normativa. El Distrito Escolar Unificado de Los Ángeles indicó que estaba “a la espera de más directrices” del departamento de educación estatal, que también declinó hacer comentarios.
Para V., las clases de inglés son más importantes para su familia que para cualquier otra cosa, repitió repetidamente. Su hija está a punto de cumplir 11 años y prefiere hablar inglés que español, aunque tiene un impedimento que le cuesta comunicarse en ambos idiomas. V. dijo que quiere poder hablar más inglés con su hija, con la esperanza de que le ayude, a pesar de los riesgos de ir a clase.
 “No vivimos nuestras propias vidas”, dijo V. “Vivimos para nuestros hijos”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10062023_San-Diego-Community-College-Older-Students_AH_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-07 19:56:51.147829

The Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama said in a statement Thursday that Giovanna Hernandez Martinez was taken into custody on Tuesday after a traffic stop in Leeds. The release states that she has a business, Juntos Coaching and Consulting, that assists youth in the state.
“Giovanna is not only a trusted community partner, she is a role model,” said Carlos E. Alemán, CEO of ¡HICA!. “She brings purpose and heart to everything she does. Her contributions have touched families and young people throughout Alabama, and her detention is a painful loss for the entire community.”
HICA said has been working with Martinez and her family, speaking with state representatives and the authorities, to secure her release. HICA is also requesting the community to send letters in support of Martinez and to make a financial contribution.
Those interested in donating can contribute to a gofundme page.
“We urge immigration authorities to consider her longstanding contributions and act with humanity and fairness,” HICA said in the news release. “Giovanna’s voice is vital, and her presence is needed in the communities she so selflessly serves.”

(Photo courtesy Santa Fe National Forest)The Laguna Fire’s escape from containment lines last month did not result from United States Forest Service personnel cuts or upheaval at the agency, an agency spokesperson told Source New Mexico on Thursday. 
Instead, an unpredicted wind gust changed the course of the blaze, which can happen in wildland firefighting sometimes, said USFS spokesperson Claudia Brookshire. 
Wildfire “is dynamic and complex,” she told Source on Thursday. “There’s never zero risk.”
On July 12, the Forest Service announced that a spot fire had ignited outside of containment lines of a Rio Arriba County fire that the Forest Service had been monitoring for about two weeks, part of a strategy to “actively manage” the blaze and encourage low-intensity fire through a roughly 13,000-acre area. 
Noting that the fire was burning in an area that had undergone a National Environmental Policy Act review, and had previously been subject to prescribed burns and thinning, Santa Fe National Forest Deputy Forest Supervisor Anthony Madrid said the fire presented “an opportunity to create a resilient ecosystem” and reduce future fire risk. 
Laguna Fire grows to more than 15,000 acres after spot fire escapes management boundaries

But an “unpredictable change in weather” sent a spot fire raging to the northeast edge of the blaze. In doing so, the fire killed cattle and imperiled two firefighters, who were trapped and had to deploy fire shelters to avoid serious injury. 
The fire is now largely contained at 78% — as of Monday — and reduced to smoldering. It’s burned about 17,500 acres, and has 17 people assigned to fully extinguish the blaze.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) recently demanded answers about the fire, writing a letter July 21 to United States Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz about whether the Forest Service could have prevented the escape if it had more staffing.
“Did recent Forest Service staff reductions have any effect on the agency’s decision-making during this fire?” she asked. She also asked the Forest Service to account for how many full- and part-time Santa Fe National Forest Service employees it had on June 1. 
By the #s: Where the Laguna Fire spread after escaping ‘focus area’

Santa Fe National Forest Service spokesperson Claudia Brookshire told Source on Thursday that she believes Schultz is finalizing answers to those questions, and she said Forest Service officials are taking staff from Leger Fernandez’s office to the burn scar Friday. 
She also said, despite the ongoing upheaval at the Forest Service, along with firings and early retirements, the Laguna Fire and other fires have been staffed adequately. 
“There has been reorganization and some changes within the Forest Service, but that does not apply to fire or incidents. Every incident has to be properly staffed,” she said. “And so not only did we have staff from the [Santa Fe National] Forest, but we had resources from other states that come in, other forests. So we were fully staffed.”
While the Forest Service claims that, nationally, it has reached 99% of its firefighter staffing goal, internal data obtained by ProPublica shows that the figure is misleading. The public data does not include resignations from the agency nor does it disclose that many senior management positions are vacant. 
In addition to killing cattle and endangering the firefighters, the blaze burned at far higher intensity in the area it escaped into than it did in the area to which firefighters were hoping to contain the conflagration. That’s according to a Burned Area Emergency Response team map released Aug. 1.
  The fire intensity of the Laguna Fire, shown here on a spectrum from blue to red, was highest in the northeast edge of the burn scar. That’s the area the fire escaped into July 11. (Photo courtesy BAER team)


While 81% of the total wildfire burned at “unburned/very low or low intensity,” according to the BAER team, the map shows that the vast majority of the “high intensity” wildfire occurred in the northeast part of the burn scar. That’s where the fire ran when it escaped. 
About 5% of the fire was “high” intensity and 14% was “moderate.” Areas scorched in high or moderate intensity wildfires can see long-lasting effects, including hydrophobic soil that intensifies floods and debris flows, and sometimes can mean no vegetation regrows for a long time. 
Brookshire acknowledged that the high intensity fire occurred where the escape happened. She said the BAER team is working on a report now that will help land managers and communities decide how best to prepare for flood or other consequences of the damaging fire. 
“From what I’ve seen, there’s not tremendous impacts to those watersheds, but there may be some,” she said. 
Impacts could include ash flows and some flooding to private lands that are already in a floodplain, she said, and noted if significant flooding or other damage  occurs, the Forest Service will intervene.
“Although it burned at high severity, again, it’s mostly in areas that are not impacting the watershed, and so at this point, there’s no plans for reforestation or anything like that,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Laguna-Fire-burned-in-a-mosaic-pattern-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-08-07 19:56:51.147829

Mosquitos require blood for their reproductive cycles, but can also be a serious vector in spreading diseases, such as West Nile, between humans and other animals. (Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Health officials confirmed New Mexico’s first human case of West Nile virus Thursday, saying the Valencia County adult who contracted the virus was briefly hospitalized, but has since returned home. 
West Nile is a virus spread through mosquito bites between humans, birds and horses.  While several species of mosquito can spread the disease, the Culex family of mosquito, which can be found across the state, is the biggest threat. No vaccines exist for people, nor do specific treatments for the infection.
The New Mexico Department of Health previously warned of future infections after mosquitos captured in Bernalillo County tested positive for the virus in early July. 
“Our first infection of the year is always a good reminder that West Nile does circulate throughout the state,”New Mexico State Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps told Source New Mexico. 
In a news release, NMDOH said West Nile virus infection has also been confirmed in three horses in New Mexico this year: two in Lea County and one in Eddy County.
Phipps encouraged measures to reduce mosquito bites: limiting activity at dusk and dawn; wearing loose-fitting long sleeves and pants; and using insect repellent can lower individual risks. The health department recommends using Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus/para-menthane-diol.
Most infections are asymptomatic, with some people experiencing a headache or mild fever, Phipps said, but about 1% of cases can cause a very severe neurological disease. 
“Late summer is the time we expect to see the most West Nile infections so we’re expecting to see more in August and into September,” Phipps said. 
New Mexico health officials have reported about 500 cases of West Nile since 2005, with at least one death in all but two years. New Mexico’s most severe outbreak occurred in 2023, with 80 recorded cases and eight deaths.
Reducing mosquito breeding grounds on private property is another tack, saying that any outdoor water bowls or birdbaths should be refilled at least once a week to interrupt any mosquito larvae. 
“Any standing water in debris, toys, saucers under potted plants can all catch water and provide locations for mosquitos to breed,” Phipps said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Culex-quinquefasciatus-female-feeding-16-9-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-07 17:56:45.281230

The center, located on an old airport runway surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, will continue to operate and process immigrants, however.
“We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, in a news release.
The two-week restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams comes as the court considers a preliminary injunction against the facility.
“Today’s ruling by an activist judge will have no impact on immigration enforcement in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts,” Alex Lanfranconi, a Gov. Ron DeSantis spokesperson, posted to social media Thursday afternoon.
The injunction stops filling, paving, new lights, and new infrastructure.
DeSantis previously claimed construction at the facility was temporary and all operations would be carried out using portable units.
Environmental advocacy groups and the Miccosukee Tribe joined together to oppose construction, including pavement laid despite DeSantis’ claims.
“This facility is not only a threat to one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in the country,” Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in a news release.
“It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources. Constructed in direct conflict with the Everglades restoration efforts supported by taxpayers for decades, this project represents both environmental negligence and human rights violations.”
There was a hearing Wednesday about the restraining order.
Plaintiffs including Friends of the Everglades argued the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.
Williams took over the case after Judge Jose Martinez recused himself.
The center has been controversial, sparking this and other lawsuits with Democratic lawmakers strongly speaking out against it.
“It’s a relief that the court stepped in to protect the Everglades’ sensitive waters, starry skies, and vulnerable creatures from further harm while we continue our case,” said Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’re ready to press forward and put a stop to this despicable plan for good.”
The center has generated national headlines. President Donald Trump visited the facility last month and the Republican Party of Florida is using the center’s moniker on merchandise while immigrant advocacy groups speak out against conditions inside the facility.
“The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people,” Talbert Cypress, Cchairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida said in the news release.
“While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to stand for our culture, our sovereignty, and the Everglades.”

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm


















A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am


















Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm


















After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launches bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday June 10, 2025 7:02 am


















Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Republican state senator enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 22, 2025 12:01 pm


















State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

Former Senate President Troy Jackson enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday May 19, 2025 11:59 am


















Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson is running for governor in the 2026 election.
The fifth-generation logger announced Monday that he will join the Democratic primary, saying in a news release from his campaign that “too many Democrats have lost touch with working people or shown they’re not up to the fight.”
“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added.

Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows officially announces bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 26, 2025 7:53 am


















Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, who is also a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, was unanimously selected to receive a prestigious award from a local labor group that highlighted his support for working families and commitment to organized labor.
Swanson’s campaign announced Thursday that he was named the Tri-County Building & Construction Trades Council’s 2025 Person of the Year.
“We’re proud to be walking with Swanson and we voted unanimously to make him our Labor Person of the Year,” Justin Pomerville, the council’s president, said in a statement.
The council recognized Swanson with the award at its Thursday morning meeting, where leaders praised his track record of partnership, action and advocacy for Michigan’s workforce.
“Organized labor built this state and I will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the workers who power Michigan’s economy,” Swanson said in a statement. “I come from the union, I believe in the union, and I’ll never stop fighting for fair wages, safe worksites, and strong benefits.”
Swanson is an active member of AFT Local 6244 through his role as a lecturer at the University of Michigan-Flint. He also touts deep ties to labor, reflected in a growing list of union endorsements, including:

BEW Local 948
IUOE Local 324
Iron Workers Local 25
UA Local 85
UA Local 370
Teamsters Local 332

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki are also in the race seeking the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for governor.
On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Portage, former Attorney General Mike Cox, former House Speaker Tom Leonard of DeWitt, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Traverse City native Evan Space are seeking their party’s nomination.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is also running for governor but as an independent candidate.

Getty ImagesA research project at Emory University is among the 22 grants and contracts that are being cancelled as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services begins a “coordinated wind-down” of research studying mRNA vaccine technology. 
The grants, which were being developed under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, amounted to nearly $500 million in funding to research projects. According to the agency website, researchers at Emory received $750,000 to develop an inhalable dry powder that could be used to immunize patients against influenza and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Emory University did not respond to a request for comment.
Vaccines using mRNA were first developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2023. While traditional vaccines can take years to develop, mRNA vaccines can be developed much faster, and can be more quickly adapted in response to virus mutations.
However, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines and promoted widely debunked claims about vaccine harm — claimed that the Trump administration was terminating the grants because mRNA vaccines “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”

“We’re shifting that funding toward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate,” he said in an Aug. 5 announcement. Research contracts with companies like Luminary Labs, ModeX Therapeutics, and CSL Seqirus are also being cancelled.
The most recent round of grant terminations comes on the heels of a nearly $600 million contract with Moderna aimed at developing a vaccine against bird flu that was cancelled by the Trump administration in May.
  State Rep. Michelle Au. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Public health experts, including state Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, condemned the decision to terminate the grants.
“Many preventable diseases will not, in fact, be prevented,” she said. “We will see the result of many chronic health conditions resulting from preventable disease, and those effects are going to last decades. This is a generational change in how we approach vaccine support and funding, not just in this country, but worldwide.”
Georgia’s current childhood vaccine rates are also far below the 95% rate needed to ensure herd immunity from measles, mumps and rubella, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only 88.4% of kindergarten students in Georgia received the MMR vaccine during the 2023-24 school year.
Au, who works as an anesthesiologist, also warned of the harm that could await future patients due to vaccine research cuts.
“We’re only starting to scratch the surface of the damage that we’re going to see,” she said. “When you stop research in its tracks like this, even if you say, ‘oh, maybe we’ll restore the cuts in the future,’ these are harms that will carry through even beyond what the immediate funding cuts generate.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)AIKEN — A new research center at the University of South Carolina Aiken boasts a mini data center for running artificial intelligence experiments, a two-stories-tall room for massive projects and a biomaterials manufacturing lab. Soon, a fleet of robots will operate inside.
The 63,000-square-foot building, called the Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative, is designed to provide everything needed for the nation’s nuclear scientists and business leaders to work together on technological breakthroughs.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright was on hand — along with U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham and U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, whose 2nd District includes Aiken — to cut the ribbon Wednesday on the $66 million center following three years of construction. No one’s working inside yet. The equipment to be used by a hundred scientists is still being moved in.
The project is a partnership between the federal energy and nuclear agency’s nearby Savannah River National Laboratory and the state’s largest college system. USC Aiken provided the property. The federal government footed the bill.

The purpose of the center is to put the scientists to work developing technologies that companies need.
It also offers internship opportunities and training to USC Aiken students.
The idea is to prepare them for jobs at the companies contracting with the center as well as openings at the national nuclear site that once played a role in building the nation’s atomic arsenal. The center, located on campus, is a 15-mile drive from a main entrance to the 310-square-mile site.
“Students and faculty will now be able to engage directly with cutting-edge projects, alongside renowned scientists and industry partners,” said USC Aiken Chancellor Dan Heimmermann.
“But this is not just about research. This is about people and jobs,” he added. “This is about expanding opportunity, growing the regional workforce, and providing our students and our community with access to technologies and expertise that will define the next century.”
‘Money well spent’
It’s a project that’s been more than a decade in the making and one the national energy secretary called essential to the Trump administration’s goals of increasing nuclear power generation, opening up more manufacturing and advancing AI technology.
Wright talked about his visit to the Savannah River National Laboratory a day earlier where scientists demonstrated an ultra-absorbent material developed in the lab.
“Set it down in a puddle of water and, bam, the puddle of water is gone,” he said. “It’s impressive to see it.”
Developing advancements, such as that material, on behalf of private companies is what the new center is all about, Wright added.

“We want to bring jobs and manufacturing, technology, innovation and advancements here to our country,” he said “We can build big things in this country again. We can build data centers. We can build factories. Central to that effort is right here.”
Graham chimed in saying he helped secure the funding to build the center with the goal of leveraging the Savannah River Nuclear Site and lab to attract more private investment to the region.
“It was money well spent,” Graham said of the center. “I’m excited about what it can do for the community in terms of jobs, but also how it can make our nation stronger. This will be a place for research and development for the big needs of our country.”
In 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy, the federal agency that manages the country’s nuclear stockpile, brought on a new contractor to run the national lab, which employs 1,400 people, as part of a 10-year, $3.8 billion deal. At the time, the contractor, Battelle, said it planned to substantially grow the lab’s national security purview to include cybersecurity and nuclear weapons.
Savannah River is the only federal site in the country that recycles tritium, the radioactive form of hydrogen, for use in nuclear weapons. In recent years, federal officials have sought to add weapons-grade plutonium recycling to the site’s list of responsibilities.
Producing tritium and plutonium for the nation’s Cold War arsenal was the original purpose of what used to be called the Savannah River Plant, or “bomb plant” to locals.

Bill Taylor, R-Aiken, Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025, during a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative on the University of South Carolina Aiken campus.

Plutonium decays over centuries. The recycling of spheres of plutonium, called pits, used in nuclear weapons has become a priority as the country’s nuclear arsenal ages and scientists have no way of knowing how long the pits will remain usable.
Scientists at Savannah River are expected to salvage usable plutonium from old pits and recycle it into new ones. The site had plans to make 50 pits per year by 2030, though those efforts have been stalled by legal challenges.
3 SC colleges could split $120M to educate students for jobs at nuclear laboratory

Other developments
During the ribbon cutting, Wright also told the crowd that the Savannah River Site is on a short list for an AI data center and an on-site power plant.
Some state legislative leaders have pushed back against the growing fleet of data centers in South Carolina because of the massive amount of energy they require — as much as 200 megawatts for some of the largest centers.
“It uses water. It requires new power resources. So there’s trade-offs,” Wright conceded. “But I think the upsides are just gigantic.”
“These data centers are going to be what drives the advancement of science,” Wright added. “What are data centers? They’re energy intensive manufacturing. They take the highest form of energy, electricity, and turn it into the highest possible value product, intelligence.”
Graham too voiced his support for the power-gobbling centers, calling the race for AI dominance one the United States can’t afford to lose. He said he welcomes the development of such centers in the state.
“We’ll take them,” he said. “And let me tell you why: it’s the future.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_1506-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 17:56:45.281230

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)It’s back to the drawing board for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA).
The agency’s Board of Directors voted Thursday morning to table a proposal that would have slashed or reduced services on the majority of its bus routes, all in the hope of repairing a $10 million hole in the agency’s budget for fiscal year 2026.
The somewhat anticlimatic reversal followed a last-minute plea from Gov. Dan Mckee, who intervened with a letter advising the board not to act in haste by approving what he dubbed a plan too reliant on “across-the-board reductions to routes.”
“As Governor, I have a responsibility to riders and to hear their concerns — but I also have a duty to every taxpayer footing the bill,” McKee wrote in his letter, which was sent to members of the press at 9:21 a.m. and distributed as hard copies to board members around the same time. The board meeting started at 9:30.
Board Chair Peter Alviti Jr., who also heads the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, moved to postpone the vote so that the board could have more time to digest the governor’s proposal, as well as the results of a $412,346 efficiency study that emerged last week, well after its original deadline of March 1.
The agency will need to implement service changes by Oct. 1 if it wants to capture savings for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, RIPTA CEO Chris Durand told reporters after the meeting. That means time remains short for the board to approve viable alternatives, or the solutions McKee rebuked: An array of system-wide bus service cuts, ranging from 10% reductions to outright elimination of 58 of 67 routes. The cuts were set to take effect Sept. 13 if approved.
Alviti said at the meeting that any decision on the cuts, or other alternative solutions, will emerge in the coming days or weeks — a sentiment he shared earlier Thursday morning with WPRO radio host Gene Valicenti.
But both the meeting and Durand’s comments afterward made clear that the quasi-public agency’s essential problems won’t be solved in one year. Even with the proposed cuts, Durand projected RIPTA could face a $5 million to $7 million shortfall in fiscal year 2027.
RIPTA would have had an even bigger gap in its budget this year, $32.6 million, had the General Assembly not approved a $15 million infusion during this year’s legislative session. Favorable diesel fuel prices and market conditions for the agency’s pension plan lowered the deficit to $10 million.










As Governor, I have a responsibility to riders and to hear their concerns — but I also have a duty to every taxpayer footing the bill.


– Gov. Dan McKee in letter to RIPTA board


Now, options appear few, although McKee proposed eliminating or restructuring underperforming routes and administrative overhead, tapping underused federal programs, and raising fares or moving them to a zonal model, with prices changing depending on service area (a model unusual for bus service in the U.S.). Bus fares have been unchanged at $2 for 15 years. But Durand noted that comparable transit networks have begun adopting fare-free models.
Durand told reporters he was a bit taken aback by the timing of McKee’s letter, and he hadn’t anticipated its arrival Thursday morning, although he had recently been in contact with the governor. 
“I think it does involve some sort of temporary freedom, which might help us out,” Durand said of the postponement.
But the CEO also expressed some reservations about their feasibility. Unlocking certain federal funding sources, for instance, may actually require expanding service, not cutting them.
“We have more rural funding today than we have rural service, which means we have to actually incur more costs to provide rural service,” Durand said. 
Durand noted that zone-based fare increases don’t generate as much revenue as across-the-board increases. RIPTA is not ruling out a fare increase, he said, but it needs to be deployed carefully. 
“What we have to balance is two things,” Durand said. “First of all, we’re making massive reductions to service, so we’re going to take away frequency, or routes altogether, and make it harder for you to assist [riders.] It’s difficult to then charge them more for the same thing.”

79 jobs under the bus
During the board meeting, Durand told the board that personnel costs make up over 80% of the agency’s operating expenses for bus service. Simply discontinuing the lowest-performing routes, or redirecting all resources into the highest-performing ones, wouldn’t remove the deficit. The savings, Durand said, are largely coming from taking jobs out of the schedule, noting that the agency would need to go from about 401 drivers to 322 to get the savings it needs.
Durand gave the 88 bus as an example, calling it “a once-a-week shopping trip” that amounts to about four hours of road time overall. The route runs from the Cranston Walmart to Simmons Village in Johnston and is indeed eliminated under the recent proposal. But it won’t generate many savings because it runs so infrequently, Durand said.  
Also proposed for elimination are the 68 bus serving the Community College of Rhode Island’s Newport campus, and the 69 bus catering to students and workers at URI, which runs from the school’s Kingston campus Kingston to Galilee.
“People ride those buses,” Durand said. “We just can’t afford to operate them.”
But the potential for significant layoffs concerned board members like Pat Crowley and Normand Benoit.
“People who are going to get laid off are the ones that we’ve worked very hard to recruit and train,” Benoit said. “Recent hires…took care of the problem that we didn’t have enough bus drivers. Those are the ones who are going to go first, and I’m concerned that they’re not coming back.”
Crowley, meanwhile, reminded his colleagues that before the agency hired more drivers, “turnaround time…was so minimal that they couldn’t get off the bus to relieve themselves.” 
Benoit admitted at one point he had entered the meeting with the intention to vote “reluctantly” to approve the cuts. 
He was not overly optimistic about what comes next: “We’re not going to find $10 million. We can’t fix this fiscal year at this level, without the service cuts,” he said. “Larry Bird is not walking through that door to save us.”
But Benoit, recalling Crowley’s comments from a previous meeting, offered one hope: that the current fiscal year is still open to some revision until the governor’s supplemental budget emerges in January.
“Money can move around. That’s the purpose of supplemental,” Benoit said.

Will there even still be a statewide bus system?
Thursday’s meeting had an over an hour’s worth of public comment — a seemingly long stretch, but still an abbreviated runtime compared to a series of public hearings that preceded it. From July 28 through Aug. 6, RIPTA held a dozen public hearings on the proposed service cuts. The agency has uploaded detailed minutes for each one to its website, plus compilations of comments submitted via email and voicemail. Scattered across these documents are the names of state legislators who came to defend their constituents who rely on the bus. 
And on Wednesday night, RIPTA riders and advocates gathered in Kennedy Plaza in Providence to denounce the cuts. 
“Tomorrow we have an opportunity to persuade the board members not to go through with these devastating cuts, or tomorrow, we’ll be burying the corpse that is RIPTA,” Thomas G. Cute Jr., a retired RIPTA Driver, said at the rally. “We will not have a statewide bus system anymore.” 
McKee’s last-minute-letter may have assisted in saving RIPTA from a prompt burial, but transit riders were mostly unimpressed Thursday, describing the letter as platitudinous, tone-deaf, or a gesture that was too little, too late.  
“This letter is garbage,” said Robin Barradas, a Providence resident and bus rider who wondered why McKee swooped in only as RIPTA is “at the edge of the cliff.”










Larry Bird is not walking through that door to save us.


–  Normand Benoit, member of RIPTA’s Board of Directors


Several transit advocates took particular umbrage with McKee’s reliance on the concept of “rightsizing,” viewing it as a euphemistic way to conceal layoffs. Among the dissenters was state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, who called it “absolutely foolhardy” to consider eliminating drivers’ jobs after the agency had spent months trying to fix its understaffing issues.  
“We need to rightsize a lot of things in state government, and RIPTA is not one,” Tanzi said. 
Indeed, several transit advocates turned to Durand and thanked him for trying to steer the agency through a dark time in its finances. The crowd’s ire fell more squarely on the governor.  
Randall Rose of the Kennedy Plaza Resistance Coalition reminded the board that bus riders are not solitary creatures: “Riders care about this and riders’ family members care about this. Bus riders are loved.”
Said Rose: “There is an election next year, and bus riders will remember.”

Idaho health officials have not reported any confirmed measles cases in state residents this year, during the nation’s worst outbreak of the highly contagious virus in decades. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Typically, Idaho’s infectious disease reports are based on infections of state residents. Idaho has not reported a measles case since 2023, when an outbreak infected 10 people.
Last week, officials detected measles in wastewater in Coeur d’Alene. That suggests someone in the North Idaho area had measles. State health officials have encouraged doctors to look out for the disease. 
In May, a traveler in southcentral Idaho had measles.
 What to do if you’re exposed to measles

Measles — which can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves — is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected.
The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (which is inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death. A high fever, cough, runny nose, rash and red, watery eyes are common measles symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, says. 
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, health officials say. 
But Idaho has a spotty record for measles vaccinations, the Sun previously reported. 
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.

The lager, brewed at Confluence Brewing Company in Des Moines, is a partnership between the Iowa Brewers Guild, the Iowa Corn Growers and Choose Iowa, which is promoting a slew of locally produced goods at this year’s state fair. 
This is the second year the groups have partnered to create the Yield of Dreams brew and offered it to fairgoers at the Iowa Craft Beer Tent. 
According to a press release, the beer is meant to represent the relationship between the craft beer and agriculture industries. Iowa Brewers Guild, a trade association for beer and cider brewers in Iowa, celebrates locally brewed beers through its “Brewed in Iowa” campaign.

“Building on last year’s success, there’s still no better place than the Iowa State Fair to enjoy Yield of Dreams, our signature brew celebrating all things Iowa,” the guild’s executive director Noreen Otto said. “Brewed right here in Iowa with Iowa corn, it’s an ideal way for fairgoers to cool off while directly supporting our state’s rich agricultural heritage.”
Two farmers from each of the crop reporting districts donated a little over a bushel of corn which was added to the brew at Confluence Brewing Company in June. 
Ralph Lents, president of the Iowa Corn Promotion Board and a farmer from Menlo, said beer is just one of the thousands of products made from Iowa-grown corn. 
“ICPB continues to invest in partnerships, like Yield of Dreams, to help strengthen corn demand while increasing corn knowledge across the state of Iowa,” Lents said in a release.  
The Iowa State Fair opened Thursday and finishes Aug. 17. Following the fair, Yield of Dreams will be available at taprooms across the state, including Confluence Brewing. 
Other Iowa-grown fair goodies 
Choose Iowa, a marketing initiative from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, has cooking classes, contests and partnerships across the fair grounds. 
This year 30 food vendors have committed to use ingredients sourced from Iowa. The vendors have entered in Choose Iowa’s favorite fair food contest. Fairgoers through Aug. 13 can vote for their favorite food with local ingredients, including Yield of Dreams.
Eligible foods include exotic items like “The Butcher’s Donut” from Destination Grille, or a cinnamon crunch apple taco from the Iowa Specialty Crop Growers Association. There are also classic items like a pork chop on a stick from the Iowa Pork Tent, milk to go with a bucket of Barksdale’s State Fair Cookies and watermelon at Beattie’s Melon Patch. 
A full map of participants and a link to vote can be found at the Iowa State Fair website, or on the app. The winning vendor will be announced Aug. 15. 
Visitors can also get a free sample and a cooking lesson featuring local ingredients in The Kitchen at the Maytag Family Theatre Building each day at 1 p.m.
The classes vary in technicality from cooking a whole chicken, to stirring up some dill pickle lemonade or pairing wines with a spread of cheeses and bread. 
A schedule of the events can be found on the Choose Iowa Facebook page. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Choose Iowa will be “highly visible” at this year’s state fair. 
“Whether you live on a farm or in a city, the Iowa State Fair offers something for everyone to connect with our state’s rich agricultural heritage,” Naig said.

(Arielle Zionts/KFF Health News)EKALAKA, Mont. — There was no doctor on-site when a patient arrived in early June at the emergency room in the small hospital at the intersection of two dirt roads in this town of 400 residents.
There never is.
Dahl Memorial’s three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. So, she made a call for a medical plane to fly the patient to treatment at Montana’s most advanced hospital. Dowdy also called out medications and doses needed to stabilize the patient as a paramedic and nurses administered the drugs, inserted IV lines, and measured vital signs.
Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.
A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. Like Dahl Memorial, more than 90% were in low-volume or critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small, rural hospitals.
The results come from the 82% of hospitals that responded to a survey sent to all emergency departments in the country, except those operated by the federal government. The study is the first of its kind so there isn’t proof that such staffing arrangements are increasing, said Carlos Camargo, the lead author and a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common.
Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn’t without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians’ extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them.

The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation.
Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP.
“It’s important that folks in those areas have equal access to high-quality emergency care to the greatest extent possible,” Haddock said.
Other health care providers and organizations say advanced-practice providers with the right experience and support are capable of overseeing ERs. And they say mandating that a physician be on-site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can’t afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors.
“In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,”said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs.
“I’m not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said.
Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn’t unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup.
The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on-site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments.

But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. In Montana it was 46%, the third-highest rate.
None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Neither does Wyoming or Idaho.
But Sanford Health, which bills itself as “the largest rural health system in the United States,” is launching an emergency medicine residency in the region. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based program is intended to boost the ranks of rural emergency doctors in those states, the residency director said in a
news release.
Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state’s northeast. Working in such a rural area has given him nuanced views on whether states should require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs.
Adelman said he supports such laws only where it’s feasible, like in Virginia. He said the state’s emergency physicians’ organization pushed for the law only after doing research that made it confident that the requirement wouldn’t shutter any rural hospitals.
Camargo said some doctors say that if lawmakers are going to require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs, they need to pay to help hospitals implement it.
Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn’t possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren’t refraining just to save money.
He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state’s hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. The report was part of a mandated process to improve the state’s troubled health care system.
Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians.
Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Few NPs have emergency certification, an analysis found.
The Society of Emergency Medicine PAs outlines training and experience PAs should have before practicing in rural areas or without on-site doctors.
Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night.
Haddock said ACEP wouldn’t want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded.

Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms.
She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said.
She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn’t enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways.
Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn’t had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there’s a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. Other rural hospitals, he noted, may have physicians either as permanent staff who leave after a few years or contract workers who fly in for a few weeks at a time.
People eating at Ekalaka’s sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital’s clinic all told KFF Health News that they’ve been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers.
Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who’ve been treated for more serious problems.
“We’ve got to have this facility here because this facility saves a lot of lives,” Bruski said.

At a press conference Thursday at the HCA HealthONE Rose hospital in Denver, U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette and Colorado health care experts warned that Coloradans will have higher health insurance premium costs without congressional renewal of the enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said the federal tax break and spending cut bill recently passed by congressional Republicans and signed into law by President Donald Trump will lead to an average 28% increase in health insurance premiums for Coloradans. She said it could grow to a 38% increase in Western parts of the state.  
DeGette cited an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that found that 16 million Americans will lose access to health care because of Medicaid cuts and the expiration of the tax credits, which benefits marketplace enrollees under the Affordable Care Act. The credits will expire at the end of the year and will affect 321,000 Coloradans, she said.
“Those are not people who are able-bodied workers who are just sitting at home as the Republican Party claims,” DeGette said. “These are Americans who can’t navigate the red tape.”
The enhanced tax credits were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. According to KFF, insurance providers have cited the expiration of the tax credits as a reason for premium increases. 
Adam Fox, deputy director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, said the “vast majority” of premium increases can be attributed to the Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which he said will lead to “ugly  consequences for Coloradans.” He said the expiration of the tax credits “throws the health insurance market into chaos.” 
“The failure to extend the enhanced premium tax credits in (the Republican budget bill) and the other changes that are being made to the Affordable Care Act are unconscionable,” Fox said. “ Republicans may not have gone for fully repealing the ACA, but they are doing everything they can to strangle it, and they are driving up costs for millions of Americans.”
  Adam Fox, deputy director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, speaks at a press conference about how expiring enhanced premium tax credits will affect health insurance costs in Colorado on Aug. 7, 2025, at the HCA HealthONE Rose hospital in Denver.
Nina Schwartz, chief policy and external affairs officer for Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s insurance marketplace, said 80% of enrollees receive financial assistance through the cut tax credits. She said this has made health coverage more accessible for people across the state. 
Representatives from Colorado hospital systems noted at Thursday’s press conference that when people lose their health insurance coverage, they start to use emergency rooms as their primary care. 
“That is care that becomes more expensive and ultimately is funneled through the emergency department, because you are ultimately not getting care in the right time at the right place at the most costly intervention,” said Megan Axelrod, vice president of the Colorado Hospital Association. 
In this quarter, Axelrod said Colorado hospitals have already $141 million on charity care, which she said is more than a 250% increase from the same time in 2019. 
Laura-Elena Porras, health policy and coverage program director at Doctors Care, a safety net community health center in Littleton, said most of the patients her clinic works with earn under $35,000 a year for a single person and under $65,000 for a family of three. She said the enhanced premium tax credits “have made coverage possible for these families.”
“With the expiration of these subsidies and no extension in the (Republican budget bill), we’re bracing for major disruptions in our program,” Porras said. “We expect higher premiums, more confusion, and fewer people getting covered.”
Baker-Hauck said she anticipates her health care costs will consume more than 42% of her income next year. She said her family already can’t afford health care, as they have emptied their savings, retirement funds, and acquired $10,000 in medical debt. Her husband declined cancer treatment last year “because we couldn’t afford to pay his deductible too.” 
“What do I cut when there’s nothing left to cut? If I cut insurance, I die. It’s that simple,” Baker-Hauck said. “How can any middle-class American be expected to bear this kind of financial burden?”
America’s health care system “is already unworkable,” and it’s only going to get worse, Baker-Hauck said. She said Congress should work to make health care more affordable and accessible, not less. 
“Republicans in Congress have taken an imperfect healthcare system, and they broke it entirely,” Baker-Hauck said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-07 21:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Parents say Bridgeport schools fail to provide adequate special ed support,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/07/special-education-complaint-bridgeport/,"A complaint filed by the Center for Children’s Advocacy alleges district violated rights of special ed students, failed to provide services.","Jacqueline Oliver says her daughter, a student at Bridgeport Public Schools who has autism, was allowed on two separate days last winter to beat her head against a hard surface more than 150 times without someone stepping in to intervene.
“God forbid if I got home and my daughter would’ve done something out of the norm like taking a nap. And what if she would’ve never woken up?” Oliver told the state Board of Education during a meeting in January. 
Oliver’s story was one of several included in a complaint to the state made by the nonprofit Center for Children’s Advocacy alleging Bridgeport schools have violated the rights of special education students by failing to provide them with an adequate education. 
It’s the fourth complaint the organization has filed against the school district since 2013, according to attorney Kathryn Meyer, the director of the Yale Child Study Center Medical-Legal Partnership Project. 
Meyer said CCA filed a complaint in 2021 also in reference to the high turnover in the district. But although the state did a “thorough investigation” and issued “pretty substantive corrective action,” she said, most of the administrators and staff members who were present in 2021 are now no longer with the district. 
The complaint claims that the school district, as of late June, had 24 vacancies for special education teachers and 46 vacancies for paraeducators, with “no concrete plan to promptly fill these vacancies.” 
In the case of Oliver’s daughter, her classroom was being led by substitute teachers who did not have special education certification, and the paraeducators working in the classroom were not trained to work with autistic students, according to the complaint. 
CCA’s complaint, which cites Oliver’s experience, said this caused the girl to experience a great deal of anxiety and stress — by late March, she was refusing to enter the school building. When she agreed to return in May, she was met with another substitute teacher. 
“[The student] effectively made no academic progress during the 2023-2024 school year and missed countless hours of specialized instruction and related service hours,” the CCA complaint read. 
According to the complaint, at least a dozen special education classrooms across the Bridgeport district do not have a certified special education teacher to lead them, and long-term substitute teachers lead classrooms with some of the students who have the greatest needs. Paraeducators, who are meant to work one-on-one with special education students, have been assigned to other areas of the district. 
Bridgeport Public Schools did not provide a comment to the Connecticut Mirror in time for publication.
State Department of Education Chief of Staff Laura Stefon confirmed the state had received the complaint and assigned it to an investigator. She said representatives for the department had spoken with CCA about it, and that the department had already released a forensic audit and implemented a technical assistance team to work in the district.  
Another parent whose story was included in the complaint, Caroline Lindsay, told the state Board of Education in January that her two daughters hadn’t received the services they needed. 
Lindsay said her younger daughter, who just completed first grade and has autism, spent more than 90% of her kindergarten year without a special education teacher. She explained to CT Mirror that without the necessary attention, she became more prone to meltdowns, biting and hitting while in school. Her daughter also failed to make progress toward her academic goals. 
Lindsay said at the state Board of Education meeting in January that her daughter was injured by classmates three times within three months. She told CT Mirror the girl was bit multiple times and got scratched on her face.
She said the district has agreed to place her daughter in a private school, but that the placement has been delayed because that school is also short-staffed. 
Lindsay’s older daughter, who just completed third grade, received services from a speech therapist that were “intermittent, at best,” she said. She told CT Mirror that over the past two years, the district only had a speech therapist for part of the year. 
“She is nonverbal and continues to struggle with communication of any kind, stunting her ability to connect socially and emotionally with her peers as well,” Lindsay told the Board of Education, adding that the district should be “ashamed” that its services were unreliable for the families who live in the community. 
Sarah Eagan, the executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy, told CT Mirror that the loss of special education services isn’t just an academic problem — it also puts children at risk. 
“ The denial of those services, the lack of a special education teacher, doesn’t just rob them of their civil rights to learn to speak, to learn to communicate, to learn to use the bathroom, to learn to make friends, to learn to understand and make academic progress — which is bad enough. It also leaves them in danger in their environment where they can be hurt — and are hurt,” she said. 
Although students who have missed services are supposed to have those services made up through compensatory time, the complaint said the district has failed to make up those hours in a timely fashion. 
Eagan said that while nearly every district in the state was dealing with staff shortage, the problem was particularly visible in Bridgeport. 
Meyer said that a particular challenge in Bridgeport has been the ongoing administrative changes — the district has had six superintendents in the last nine years. 
A forensic audit of the school district, released last month, found that a lack of oversight from the state Board of Education coupled with questionable budgeting practices had created an inaccurate portrait of the district’s finances. In response to a $39 million budget shortfall, the district has cut multiple positions, including assistant principals, librarians, kindergarten paraprofessionals and 20 teaching roles. 
The board voted in January to allow the state to intervene in the Bridgeport Public Schools by providing a “technical assistance team,” required training for district board members and having the state approve the district’s permanent hire for superintendent. 
The state has also expressed concern about the district’s ability to address special education needs, noting that the state was receiving an increased number of complaints and legal filings related to special education in Bridgeport. 
The state has created a website documenting its interventions in Bridgeport Public Schools. 
As of February 2025, the district reported a shortage of 26 special education teachers and nine special education paraprofessionals. In a report from May 2025, the state Department of Education found that 75 of 89 one-on-one paraprofessional roles were being filled by a staffing agency that contracts with the district. 
The complaint also noted that teachers and staff were being pressured not to refer students to be evaluated for special education services, and staff were required to wait for administrative approval before they could recommend any services that would cost money — limiting the ability of a child’s special education team to make decisions collaboratively with the child’s parents.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BRIDGEPORT-SPED-COMPLAINT-0807-DE-004-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 17:56:45.281230

(Photo courtesy Polk County Assessor's Office)After being accused in a lawsuit of wrongful death and cited for violations that led to two residents having their legs amputated, a West Des Moines nursing home has been added to the federal list of the worst care facilities in the nation.
Pine Acres Rehabilitation and Care Center is one of the two Iowa nursing homes that are now considered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to be Special-Focus Facilities that are experiencing a serious recurrence of major regulatory violations related to quality of care.
Late last year, state inspectors cited Pine Acres for failing to ensure a male resident of the home received special shoes for diabetic patients, as ordered by a physician, and then failed to treat the resident’s worsening foot ulcers.
In October 2024, the man was seen at a hospital and diagnosed with an inflammation of the bone and pseudomonas, a bacterial infection. Days later, the resident’s left leg was amputated between the ankle and the knee.
Six weeks later, inspectors spoke to the man, who, according to the inspectors’ written report, “stated he had to have his leg amputated and he was upset about it. He stated he did not know how this happened.”
The federal government subsequently fined Pine Acres $177,240. That was in addition to a federal fine of $71,169 that was imposed eight weeks earlier for other quality-of-care violations.
In late 2023, Pine Acres was cited for 62 violations, one of which was tied to a resident who contracted gangrene in the home and had to have a leg amputated.
The home’s most recent inspection was in June 2025, when state inspectors cited the home for 10 additional regulatory violations related to patient assessments, accident hazards, the competency of the nursing staff, and infection controls. No fines were imposed as a result of those violations.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Pine Acres’ administrator, Michael Ewalt, for comment.
Rating suspended, wrongful death lawsuit filed
Earlier this year, CMS gave Pine Acres one-star ratings for quality measures and inspection results on the government’s five-star quality scale. The ratings for Pine Acres are currently suspended due to what CMS calls “serious quality issues” at the home.


Pine Acres is being sued by the family of the late Richard M. Cox, which alleges that on Oct. 21, 2024, Cox was able to exit the Pine Acres building unattended and without detection. He then sustained severe injuries in a fall about two blocks from Pine Acres and he died on Nov. 4, 2024, allegedly as a result of those injuries.
Pine Acres has denied any wrongdoing, and a trial is scheduled for May 17, 2027.
According to federal records, Pine Acres is owned and managed by a New York-based group of investors that includes Akiko Ike, who has a 60% ownership stake in the facility. Other investors include Yisroel Kaplan, who has operational control of Pine Acres and a stake in another Iowa care facility, the Prestige Care Center in Fairfield.
One of Kaplan’s partners is Ephram Lahasky, who is the husband of Ike, Pine Acres’ primary owner.
In Vermont last year, regulators raised concerns about who was behind the proposed purchase of care facilities in that state — Lahasky or his wife. Ike was the officially designated buyer, but it was Lahasky’s name that appeared on the loan documents.
Lahasky has been sued by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has accused Lahasky  and others of defrauding the government of more than $18 million while understaffing and neglecting residents at The Villages, a 120-bed facility in northwestern New York.
Ten Iowa homes ‘eligible’ for special-focus status 


At any given time, no more than two nursing homes per state appear on the list of federally designated Special-Focus Facilities, although the list also includes hundreds of other nursing homes — typically, 10 per state — where ongoing quality-of-care violations have made them eligible for that status.
Once a home is designated a Special-Focus Facility, it receives additional oversight and assistance from the government that’s intended to improve resident care. The other homes that are merely deemed eligible do not receive that assistance. They appear on the list, some for as long as 10 years, and then drop off without ever receiving the federal help.
The two Iowa care facilities currently designated Special-Focus Facilities are the newly added Pine Acres home and Aspire of Gowrie, which has been in the program for 22 months.
Pine Acres replaced Arbor Court of Mount Pleasant on the federal list. Arbor Court had been in the Special-Focus Facilities program for more than two full years before “graduating” from the program, opening up the slot now taken by Pine Acres.
As for the 10 Iowa facilities whose quality-of-care issues make them eligible for special-focus status, two of them are new to the latest version of the list, which was published by CMS on July 30. The two newly added homes are The Ivy at Davenport, located in Scott County, and Parkview Manor in Reinbeck.
Although the list from CMS indicates The Ivy at Davenport has been on the list for only one month, that’s because the home was dropped from the list for one month, in June. In May, the home had logged its 20th straight month on the eligibility list.
The eight other eight Iowa homes on the eligibility list, and the number of consecutive months they’ve appeared on the list, are:
— Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation Center in Des Moines, 36 months.
— Harmony West Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in West Des Moines, 21 months.
— Garden View Care Center in Shenandoah, eight months.
— Harvest Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Keota, six months.
— Clarion Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, five months.
— Caring Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Anita, three months.
— Pioneer Valley Living and Rehabilitation Center, Sergeant Bluff, two months.
— Aspire of Washington, two months.

Getty ImagesThe Georgia Board of Education voted Wednesday to unfreeze just over $145 million in federal funds to Georgia school districts for programs like migrant education, teacher training, English acquisition and digital literacy that were in doubt after the Trump administration abruptly paused them at the end of June.
Along with $48 million in grants unfrozen late last month for summer and after-school programs, the state has regained all funds previously delayed by the White House.
In a statement, state school Superintendent Richard Woods expressed relief and thanked the school board and department staff for working to get the funding approved as soon as they got approval from the U.S. Department of Education.
“As I’ve said before, I support both fiscal responsibility and the principle of returning control of education to states and local communities,” Woods said. “That work is only possible when states have timely access to the resources already authorized at the federal level. I’m glad Georgia districts will now have these funds in hand as we get our school year started.”
Speaking at a meeting Wednesday, Georgia DOE Deputy Superintendent of Federal Programs Shaun Owen said her team will be working to get the grant money into the hands of school districts as quickly as possible, but there are procedures they will have to follow.
“We have a process in place and we’ll follow that same process, and that’s that districts will complete their comprehensive needs assessment, and once that’s approved, then they submit the budget, and once that’s approved, then we’ll expedite the funds, but everybody’s ready and available and very anxious to get these funds to the districts as quickly as possible,” she said
School districts get their money to operate from three main sources: federal, state and local.
Georgia Budget and Policy Institute senior education analyst Ashley Young said the federal delays are coming at an inopportune time for Georgia school districts. Some districts are anticipating delays in receiving some state funding because of a change to the state’s financial software, and local money may not be available for a while.
“Local property bills come out maybe September, October, and some of those revenues may be coming late this year, and it may not be until January that schools start to see these payments roll in,” she said. “So we have both state and local delays, and this can be very difficult because many schools, of course, are starting back. They have to meet payroll, starting in July, August, up and through all of these months that they are going to be delayed with these payments.”
That could look different from district to district, but parents may notice changes over previous years.
“If there are hiccups or delays, it could be very well related to these frozen funds not being disseminated at a proper time,” Young said. “So perhaps expect delays, expect program uncertainties, expect some of these things to not run as smoothly as they perhaps typically did in the past, because there just have been a lot of political issues with money getting to the states as needed.”
Georgia Federation of Teachers president Verdaillia Turner said pressure from education advocates on both sides of the aisle helped persuade the administration to renew the funding, but she’s not declaring victory yet because future cuts remain a distinct possibility.
“We don’t want Georgians to think that they can jump up and down and say hooray, because of the temperament of the White House,” Turner said. “Anything could happen at any time in the next four years. But this money was needed, and it was voted on, and we never should have been in this debacle in the first place.”
As the White House plans to wind down the U.S. Department of Education, Turner predicted that local systems will become more active in advocating for federal resources.
“Superintendents are going to have to get active,” she said. “School boards are going to have to be more open also, not relying upon lobbyists. Everybody’s going to have to fight. If you are representing children in any fashion, you’re going to have to fight for the funds and the programs that are necessary for our children to be educated properly in today’s world.”

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)ALEXANDRIA — Brittany Johnson is preparing to move her three children from their two-bedroom apartment to a brand-new four bedroom home with big windows, bordered by shade trees. 
Johnson is a single mother who works two jobs to support her children, including a 5-year-old daughter with complex medical needs who underwent a heart transplant as an infant. 
She’s becoming a homeowner thanks to Habitat for Humanity of Douglas County and a complex web of local and federal programs that are facilitating the construction of 42 new affordable homes in Alexandria. 
Minnesota is facing a housing shortage, and the resulting higher housing costs are harming low-income residents the most. One in four Douglas County residents spend more than 30% of their income on housing, meaning they are “cost-burdened” by their rent or mortgage, said Lori Anderson, executive director of Habitat for Humanity of Douglas County.
Johnson’s new home is in a new neighborhood called Summer Meadows, the first affordable housing development in Alexandria since 2002. She opened her door on Thursday to U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, who toured the neighborhood to see the impact of federal funding on affordable housing.

Developers seeking to build new affordable housing projects often face obstacles to construction. Like market-rate developers, local zoning laws that heavily restrict multifamily developments or require certain lot or square footage can drive up the price of the home, pricing out the prospective buyers. 
Summer Meadows was initially zoned for 25 homes but Alexandria made an exception to allow 42 homes to be built, which helped the project pencil out. Smith has worked to encourage cities to allow more multifamily developments and smaller, affordable homes. 
And financing affordable projects is also a challenge, requiring a mix of private and government-backed loans, tax credits and other sources — a complex, interconnected web that can fall apart if a project is delayed or if one funding source falls through. 
Key funding for Summer Meadows comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture loans and a local tax increment financing district. 
USDA’s Rural Development division awarded Habitat a $1.6 million site loan to finance the development of the lots. The USDA is also providing qualified homebuyers with subsidized loans. 
“It allows us to keep our monthly mortgage at an affordable rate so we can avidly enjoy our lives in a safe, stable and affordable home,” Johnson said. 
The Alexandria City Council designated the neighborhood as a tax increment financing district, which will direct the residents’ property taxes back to Habitat for Humanity. Habitat for Humanity paid for the neighborhood’s streets, sewer, water, sidewalks and infrastructure; the organization will recoup its costs via homeowners’ property taxes. 
Smith is a lead author of the bipartisan Rural Housing Service Reform Act, which was included in a housing package that unanimously passed the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on July 29. Smith’s bill would make several technical changes to the USDA programs that support housing development to streamline and speed up the process.
“Even though it’s hard to spot the bipartisanship in Washington right now, I do really believe that there is a bipartisan interest and concern and desire to take action around how to address this housing supply and housing affordability crisis,” Smith said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/homeowner-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-08-07 17:56:45.281230

CT's award under Solar for All was $62.45 million.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy.
The funding, part of the Biden-era’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.
The move would put an end to several clean energy projects in Connecticut, officials with the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said. Connecticut’s award under Solar for All was $62.45 million. 
Under Republican President Donald J. Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American “energy dominance in the global market.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.
“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

In anticipation of the move, Connecticut DEEP spokesman James Fowler said in an email, “If federal support is withdrawn, states like Connecticut could be forced to halt or delay shovel-ready projects that are prepared to cut costs, clean the air, and make our grid more resilient.” 
Fowler added: “It would come at a time of record energy prices, rising electricity demand, and growing strain on households and infrastructure.” 
Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.
Fowler said DEEP had already received some funds from the award. “The award is a cornerstone of our affordability and energy justice efforts, and Connecticut is already well into the implementation process,” he said.
Led by DEEP, Connecticut developed a multi-department Solar For All program it calls “Project SunBridge – Connecting Communities to a Solar Future.” Its priority is to provide solar power to multi-family affordable housing that results in an energy savings of at least 20%.
The biggest funding recipient would have been the Connecticut Green Bank, which would get $43.05 million to generate loans, grants and other financing products. The EPA approved the plan and budget on January 15, 2025, just days before Trump took office.
Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.
“These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.
“This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said.
The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.
Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, “we will see them in court.”
Grant recipients have already challenged the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.
Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.”
“Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25219681203871-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 19:56:51.147829

(Photo provided by Institute for Justice)A group of McKenzie County landowners who spent years in court with a pipeline company wants the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that they’re entitled to attorney fees.
The case stems from a federal court settlement between the landowners and natural gas pipeline developer WBI Energy, which used eminent domain to take a portion of their property in 2018. The federal Natural Gas Act allows companies like WBI to seize property for public natural gas development with compensation for the landowners.
The confidential settlement, signed in 2021, only reimburses the landowners for the value of their property, according to court records. However, the landowners — which include Leonard and Denae Hoffmann, Randall Stevenson and Rocky Prestangen — argue they should also be compensated for the legal costs they paid to reach the settlement. They claim they’re entitled to recoup those expenses under North Dakota law.
WBI Energy counters that state law doesn’t apply because it seized the land under a federal law. When the federal government uses eminent domain to take property, it is not required to reimburse the owners for attorney fees, WBI argued. WBI declined a request for comment Thursday.
The Natural Gas Act is silent as to whether federal or state law should decide the issue of legal fees, so the parties have looked to the courts to settle the matter.
A North Dakota federal judge initially ruled in favor of the landowners, and ordered WBI to pay them roughly $380,000. That decision was overturned by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit in March. It’s the only federal appellate circuit to make this finding.
The landowners on Thursday filed a request asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the 8th Circuit’s ruling.
Allowing the 8th Circuit’s decision to stand would pave the way for a “massive wealth transfer” from landowners to private companies, said Bob McNamara, the lead attorney representing the McKenzie County property owners.
He said historically, courts have recognized that state property laws should be honored in federal eminent domain cases.
For the first 100 years of the United States’ existence, eminent domain was exclusively a state power, not a federal power, McNamara added.
While it’s very rare for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to review a case, McNamara said the  high court has a record of taking lawsuits involving eminent domain and property rights cases.
The split between the 8th Circuit and other courts could also attract the Supreme Court’s attention, he added.

Groundbreaking was held Thursday for Delta Cares Center. It will be a $10 million addition to the comprehensive Leland Medical Clinic that has served the region since 2013. 
The expansion is made possible by a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to Delta Health Alliance, a nonprofit organization that works to improve access to health services in the mostly rural, impoverished part of the state. 
The decision to focus the new center on rehabilitative therapies and dentistry was born from the need providers saw in the main clinic, said Karen Matthews, CEO of Delta Health Alliance. 
“Dentistry is just very hard to come by in the Delta for our population,” Matthews said. “And people desperately needed it. Also with physical, occupational and speech therapy – it’s very hard to come by. And when people can get it, the wait is just extremely long.”

While construction of the new building will take approximately a year, Matthews said patients can make dental appointments immediately to be seen in the clinic’s mobile van. 
A sliding fee scale is available to people whose income is less than about $31,000 annually for one person or $53,000 for a family of three – below 200% of the federal poverty level. Fees start as low as $3.
That’s available for patients who are uninsured, as well as those who have what many call “junk” insurance plans, said Hilary Meier, head of Leland Medical Clinic. 
“Anybody can apply for the sliding fee scale, even if you have insurance, because a lot of people have really high deductibles or co-pays,” Meier said. “If they qualify then they can be in that sliding fee scale for any of the services we provide at the clinic.”
In addition to flexible cost options, the clinic also offers free transportation to those who need it with a van that picks up patients up to 45 minutes away. That service will also be available for the new Delta Cares Center. 
“Our mission for Leland Medical Clinic is to be able to serve everyone in the community regardless of their ability to pay or not, and to be able to offer high-quality services to everyone,” Meier said. “So that will expand into this new building, as well, and with the additional services that we’re going to be able to offer our community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/07144332/DSC3656.jpg,,,2025-08-07 17:56:45.281230

(Campaign photo)A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent. 
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents. 
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate. 
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.
In a May press release announcing consideration of his gubernatorial run, Glowa described himself as a political outsider, social progressive and a fiscal conservative. He supports a progressive tax reforms, including increasing taxes on the wealthy, he said.
“In my opinion, the government has no business telling anyone what they can or cannot do with their reproductive system,” he wrote.
He also said one of his first actions if he wins would be to appoint a panel of “apolitical government experts” to examine Maine’s constitution, all laws, all rules and all programs “and recommend much needed changes.”
Glowa previously ran for governor in 2022, unsuccessfully challenging Gov. Janet Mills, who will be termed out in November 2026. His website says he’s running as an independent this year because “I believe in putting people before party.”
Independent candidates won’t compete in the party-specific primaries next June, but they need a higher signature threshold to be on the November 2026 ballot in comparison to party candidates. 
If each of the three independent candidates collect between 4,000 and 5,000, they could all be on the ballot alongside the Democratic and Republican nominees.

“As difficult as it is and as onerous as it could be on the candidate or the public official, it is still a high calling. We need the next generation of young people in the United States of America to choose to serve,” Casey said during the job announcement on Tuesday. 
“They might choose to serve and have different points of view than I do, or other students might have. But just like the University’s Center for Ethics and Excellence in Public Service is already doing, I believe it’s critically important that young people are inspired and even taught that if you serve in public office, you have to do it ethically,” he added

Dan McKee has tapped a familiar face to return to his former job leading state economic development efforts.
McKee unveiled Stefan Pryor as his pick for Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Thursday afternoon. If confirmed by the Rhode Island Senate, the nomination will return Pryor to the same post he held for eight years, from 2015 to 2022. 
“Stefan Pryor has the experience and the right skill set to steer Rhode Island’s economic development efforts,” McKee said in a statement. “He has forged strong relationships with business over the years, knows Rhode Island’s strengths and potential, and is skilled at liaising between the public and private sectors.” 
After a failed run for Rhode Island General Treasurer in 2022, Pryor went on to lead the state housing department. He served as housing secretary from February 2023 to July 2024, before leaving for the private sector.
The once-prominent state cabinet head known for helping lure big-name companies to Rhode Island with public subsidies, and later, to shore up the nascent and struggling housing department, disappeared from the public eye after stepping away from state government. He most recently worked as a partner for Palm Venture Studios, a Connecticut-based impact investment firm.
However, speculation over his return to Commerce began to swirl after former Commerce Secretary Liz Tanner announced in June she would be leaving to take a position with a new nonprofit tied to the 2026 World Cup. The need to fill the role intensified after temporary replacement, Jim Bennett, took a leave of absence for health reasons weeks into his new duties, as first reported by the Boston Globe Rhode Island. Bennett, who also serves as Commerce president and CEO, did not attend the agency’s most recent meeting on Tuesday. 
McKee’s office has not commented publicly on Bennett’s absence, but said Thursday that Bennett will return to his existing role as Commerce’s president and CEO.
“Commerce has experienced real momentum over the past several years, and we believe this partnership between Stefan Pryor and Jim Bennett will position us to build upon and accelerate our progress,” McKee said in a statement. 










Stefan Pryor has the experience and the right skill set to steer Rhode Island’s economic development efforts.

McKee touted the state’s accomplishments in economic development, including growing its ocean economy, defense, and travel industries, under his leadership. He also noted Pryor’s leadership brokering the incentive deals to lure Amazon to open its sprawling Johnston warehouse and Regent CRAFT to set up a manufacturing site for electric, passenger-carrying seagliders at Quonset Point in North Kingstown. While at Commerce, Pryor led negotiations for tax breaks for the Pawtucket soccer stadium and rebirth of Providence’s Superman building. The latter project is now uncertain due to the death of developer David C. Sweetser less than three weeks ago.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi praised Pryor’s track record at Commerce, calling him an “effective and talented public servant” in a statement Thursday.
“He brings continuity and commitment to this important position,” Shekarchi said.
McKee’s statement made no mention of the criticism of Pryor, including reports of mismanagement and troubling procurement practices during his 18-month tenure at the state housing department.
A New York native who was classmates with Gina Raimondo at Yale Law School in the 1990s, Pryor was among Raimondo’s first cabinet hires after she was elected governor in 2014. His resume includes jobs as deputy mayor of economic development in Newark, New Jersey, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which oversaw the rebuilding of the World Trade Center, and education commissioner for the state of Connecticut.
Bennett was named as Commerce president and CEO in April 2024. He previously served as executive vice president for Prospect Medical Holdings, the LA-based hospital chain operator that is now finalizing the sale of two Rhode Island hospitals, Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center, to new nonprofit owners. Bennett previously served as economic development director in Providence and as chairman of the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority.
Together, the appointed and administered leaders will be tasked with guiding the state’s economic development, including retaining large employers like Hasbro and CVS from abandoning or downsizing local headquarters, and helping small businesses open and prosper amid rising costs and workforce shortages.
The Senate has not yet scheduled a vote on Pryor’s nomination, and remains unlikely to return to session until January, Greg Pare, a spokesperson, said Thursday.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southwest Region)After receiving criticism of its delayed release of the Mexican gray wolf called Asha, along with her mate and pups, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service this week released the Quartz pack — so-named by the service — into the New Mexico wilderness.
Asha the Lobo captures the heart of New Mexico

A consortium of conservation groups that had called for Asha’s release announced the decision on Thursday. USFWS confirmed the release to Source New Mexico and said the pack was released from Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge “to the wild” on Aug. 6.
Asha — given her name by school children — became famous in 2023 when she left her pack in search of new territory — an act known as dispersal — and began wandering. Far. She wandered out of a government-set boundary, the Mexican wolf experimental population area — for wild wolves that bars them from I-40 to the New Mexico-Colorado border.
The endangered wolf’s wanderings landed her on the pages of National Geographic. Her ongoing captivity — more than a month had passed since the U.S. FWS’ own deadline for her release — prompted 8,000 citizens and 36 conservation groups to write to the service and the U.S. Interior Department in July seeking the wolves’ release.
Politics and fear fuel the fight over the Mexican gray wolf

The conservation groups announced Asha, her captive-born mate Arcadia and their five pups were released onto the conservation-managed, 244-square-mile Ladder Ranch, which adjoins the Aldo Leopold Wilderness within the Gila National Forest.
“Asha’s story should have continued in northern New Mexico where her instincts led her to travel twice — that is historic and future wolf country,” Greater Gila New Mexico advocate for WildEarth Guardians Leia Barnett said in a statement. “But until wildlife management agencies recognize that highways shouldn’t dictate where wildlife lives, Asha and the Quartz pack being released back into the Gila is the next best thing. We celebrate her new family’s next wild chapter.”
The pack’s delayed release from June, the conservation groups said in a news release, means the captive-born pups “missed the best opportunity to become accustomed to their natural prey of elk, which Mexican wolves typically learn to hunt in June and early July when elk calves abound.”
Asha’s two captures sparked numerous debates about wolf recovery strategies, and an ongoing political battle about the wild animal from ranchers and other critics of efforts to re-wild wolves.
A statement provided to Source New Mexico by a FWS spokesperson confirming the pack’s release, said: “The pack will add to the genetic diversity in the wild population, helping meet recovery goals. The Service is aware and shares the increasing concerns in the community about negative impacts to ranching from the growing wolf population. We, with the Interagency Field Team, are committed to immediately addressing any conflicts if/when they arise in partnership with the local community.”
“We are filled with hope that Asha, her mate, Arcadia, and their pups, Kachina, Aspen, Sage, Kai, and Aala, will roam freely for years to come,” Erin Hunt, managing director of Lobos of the Southwest, said in the statement. “They may not be able to read lines on a map, but these lobos can read the landscape and know where they belong. This young family will have an excellent teacher in their mom Asha, and the wild place they will call home will be better off with their presence.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/52975038918_941feecd39_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 16:56:28.623508

“The issue with placing it on the floodplain is that it reduces the available area for floodwaters to spread out and slow down,” one neighbor said.

A proposed Manchester housing development sits at the intersection of two of Vermont’s biggest crises: a shortage of affordable housing stock and the growing threat of flooding.
The proposed 43-unit project on a 8.2-acre field beneath the shadow of Equinox Mountain would include at least nine units of workforce affordable housing, according to the Manchester-based developer Paul Carroccio. The project is sited in a mixed-use zone and a flood hazard overlay district, according to the developer’s permit application. 
Manchester neighbors have voiced concerns at town meetings that the project, located on a flood-prone field, will have negative environmental impacts on future tenants and make flooding worse on their own nearby properties. Residents have also voiced aesthetic, public safety and other concerns with the proposed project. 
But the state’s Land Use Review Board determined the project is exempt from Act 250 — Vermont’s land use and development review process — because it qualifies as priority housing under Act 181 passed in 2024. The project includes at least 20% affordable housing units, is located near Manchester’s downtown and can be served by public water and sewer systems, among other requirements under the exemption. 
Four neighbors with property abutting the project sent a reconsideration request to the state’s review board, but the board upheld its original decision Monday.

One neighbor, Edward Gotgart, said he was concerned about the development increasing impervious surface and exacerbating surface erosion and property damage during future flooding events.
“The issue with placing it on the floodplain is that it reduces the available area for floodwaters to spread out and slow down, which is exactly what that field has been doing the last 100 years,” Gotgart said. 
Land Use Review Board Executive Director Peter Gill wrote in a statement to VTDigger that the decision by district staff was informed by Act 181 interim housing exemptions. 
“This exemption, of course, is based on a number of factors including a local process for review under the town’s zoning and subdivision bylaws,” Gill wrote.
The project is currently being assessed at the local level by the Development Review Board, which decided at a Wednesday meeting to continue discussing the project at its September meeting. 
Manchester Zoning Administrator Peter Brabazon declined to comment while the project is under review. 
Kyle Medash, floodplain manager for the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, said the plan to place fill in the flood hazard zone to raise the building will reduce space for water to flow in the event of a flood. 
Medash advised the town and developer to conduct a water movement analysis to assess if there would be adverse effects like additional flooding in the area due to the project’s current plan and if the development requires a redesign. 
Carroccio told VTDigger he will pursue a water flow study per the state’s recommendation. He said he is following “rules by the book” under the priority housing exemption and seeking permitting through local review, including designing a stormwater system and planning to build one foot above the base flood elevation.  
At the Development Review Board meeting, Michael Fernandez, district manager for the Bennington County Conservation District, said he and his team are opposed to developing a large-scale housing project in the “historic floodplain.”
Fernandez urged that any future hydrological study be based on a 500-year floodplain standard, not a 100-year standard. He said it is a “much more realistic standard, given the current rapid change of our climate and the increasing numbers of these extreme flooding events that we are seeing both here in Bennington County and throughout the state.”
From a planning perspective, it is valuable to site new housing projects in areas that are walkable and have access to services and jobs — but many of Vermont’s downtowns are located in floodplains, Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, said. The requirements to qualify for the Act 250 exemption attempted to straddle that “tension” between the need to invest in “healthy downtowns” and prepare for flooding, he said. 
Priority housing projects are allowed in flood hazard areas, which are considered areas of “rising water” that tend to have less severe flooding than areas in river corridors and floodways, Bongartz added.
Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, who helped draft the priority housing project exemption, said the legislation is aimed at reducing duplication of permitting and appeal processes at the federal, state and local levels that create cost barriers for building multiunit affordable housing projects.
With many municipal downtowns near rivers and in flood zones, Ram Hinsdale said priority housing projects allowed under the exemption are subject to flood resilience building standards.
“Many new buildings that have been built by our affordable housing community withstood floods in areas where most of the other homes were inundated and potentially destroyed,” Ram Hinsdale said. “We are living in a new reality where we can’t simply make land off limits or we will not have land that people can build multifamily housing on.”

Federal Emergency Management Agency reports indicate that low-income areas with older housing stock were disproportionately impacted by past flooding events in the state.
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said the affordable housing crisis has spurred “irrational exuberance” for development without properly considering environmental impacts.
Smith said she is concerned that low-income Vermonters living in affordable housing units built in flood hazard zones without Act 250 reviews will be affected by future flooding and the town will be liable for flood remediation costs. 
She said she would like to see the legislature repeal Act 181 and instead strengthen Act 250. 
“It is disturbing to see that the legislative intent was to allow priority housing in flood hazard areas,” Smith said. “How does it make any sense at all to put people in harm’s way?”

Judge rules that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must reconsider decision about relisting wolves in the Rocky Mountains under the Endangered Species Act.
The post Federal court overturns decision denying Endangered Species protections to wolves appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Daily Montanan.
A federal judge in Montana on Tuesday vacated the federal government’s determination that gray wolves in the Western United States do not need increased federal protections under the Endangered Species Act. 
Several coalitions of conservation groups filed lawsuits in federal district court last year against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in an attempt to force the agency to reapply ESA protections to the species. 
The groups praised the decision from the federal district court as a step forward towards providing greater protection for the iconic species. 
“The Endangered Species Act requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service consider the best available science, and that requirement is what won the day for wolves in this case,” Matthew Bishop, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, which represented some of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “Wolves have yet to recover across the West, and allowing a few states to undertake aggressive wolf-killing regimes is inconsistent with the law. We hope this decision will encourage the Service to undertake a holistic approach to wolf recovery in the West.”
In 2021, more than 70 organizations, led by the Western Watersheds Project, submitted a petition asking the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist gray wolves as a threatened species in the Northern Rockies, where they are managed by state governments, or to create a larger Western Distinct Population Segment for the species with added protections. 
But in a February 2024 determination, the agency declined to make any changes to gray wolves’ protected status, but said it would develop a National Recovery Plan for wolves in the lower 48 states.
“We concluded that the gray wolf in the Western United States is not in danger of extinction, or likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future, throughout all of its range or in any significant portion of its range,” the federal finding stated. “Therefore, we find that listing the gray wolf in the Western United States as an endangered species or a threatened species under the Act is not warranted.”
In the subsequent lawsuits, combined into a single suit before U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy, the conservation groups argued that Fish and Wildlife erred in its decision by failing to consider the “best available science” on wolf populations and the impacts of hunting and trapping; the full extent of the species’ historical range; and the threat posed by inadequate state and federal regulations that often bow to political headwinds. 
In his Aug. 5 ruling, Molloy wrote that “for the most part, plaintiffs are correct.” His ruling vacated most of the Fish and Wildlife finding, and sent the decision back to the agency for further consideration.

The agency “made numerous unfounded assumptions regarding the future condition of the gray wolf despite recognizing either limitation on those conditions or bias in the population estimates utilized,” Molloy wrote. “Because these deficiencies are serious and pervasive, they weigh in favor of vacating the portion of the 2024 Finding that determined that the gray wolf in the Western United States does not meet the definition of an endangered or threatened species.”
Officials in Montana — which joined the lawsuit with the federal government — decried the ruling as yet another ruling by an “activist” judge.
“Montana has a healthy, sustainable population of wolves. While we are reviewing the decision, it will not implicate our state’s management efforts or our wolf season,” said Kaitlin Price, a spokesperson for Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office. “Unfortunately, we’re not surprised to see another activist decision in favor of environmental extremists. If the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service appeals the decision, Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks will be there to support them.”
Bad science
Gray wolves were almost entirely eliminated from the lower-48 states by the 1970s, leading to their listing under the Endangered Species Act. 
In 2009, the species was delisted, leading to litigation, and in 2011, congressional action officially turned management of the species over to the states of Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and the eastern thirds of Oregon and Washington. 
Currently, gray wolves are listed as a threatened species in Minnesota and endangered in the remaining 44 states. 
According to a 2022 report by Fish and Wildlife, which formed the basis for its later determination, there were approximately 2,797 wolves in the western U.S. — including roughly 1,000 wolves in both Montana and Idaho, fewer than 400 in Wyoming, and around 200 in Oregon and Washington. The federal agency estimated an additional 20 wolves in California and Utah and two in Colorado. 
In 2023, Colorado began relocating wolves to the state, with four established packs reported as of this month. 
In the lawsuit, the conservation groups claimed Fish and Wildlife was not using adequate scientific research in estimating population data, and cast doubts on the methods utilized by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and Idaho’s wildlife agency. 
Montana uses an integrated patch occupancy model, or iPOM, to estimate wolf populations using hunter surveys and three different models to determine wolf distribution, wolf pack mean territory and average pack size. 
iPOM has been criticized by researchers in the past for not using direct data or population counts, and thus, overestimating the state’s wolf population. 
Idaho Fish and Game, meanwhile, uses a model that utilizes trail cameras to estimate population density, which has also been criticized for overcounting the species. 
Molloy wrote in his order that Fish and Wildlife is required to “meaningfully account for uncertainty and address substantive criticism,” in data used for Endangered Species assessments, and that the “failure to do so was arbitrary and capricious.”
“Ultimately, the Service failed to use the best available science in violation of the ESA when it relied on Montana’s and Idaho’s population estimates without addressing the criticisms,” Molloy wrote. 
State-mandated reduction
Montana’s Legislature has long sought to reduce the state’s wolf population closer to a “sustainable level” mentioned in the federal government’s delisting rule — roughly 450 wolves. 
The state’s population of roughly 1,100 wolves has remained steady for the last several years, despite decreased limitations on hunting and trapping in Montana. 
In 2025, the Montana Legislature considered several laws to dramatically curtail the wolf population, including enacting an unlimited quota until roughly half the state’s wolves were eradicated, but only one major bill became law. 
House Bill 259, brought by Montana Rep. Paul Fielder, R-Thompson Falls, requires the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission to apply different management techniques based on the population conditions in each region — with additional emphasis put on those with the highest populations. The bill also clarified that on private lands, hunters may use infrared and thermal imagery scopes outside of daylight hours.
Those changes to state law are reflected in a recently released proposal from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks outlining changes to the upcoming hunting and trapping season. 
Under the proposal, Fish, Wildlife and Parks’ new regulations would create a statewide hunting and trapping quota, rather than stricter regional quotas. Up to 500 wolves could be killed during the next season, up from a quota of 334 during the 2023-2024 season. 
During the 2024-25 wolf season, which ended on March 15, the take totaled 297 wolves, including 178 by hunters and 119 by trappers. The number was the highest since 2020, when 326 wolves were killed.
Changes in state management were cited as another reason for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reconsider putting wolves under federal protections, according to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
Fish and Wildlife failed to consider “politically motivated, legislative interference with agency discretion and management authority,” according to the plaintiffs, which creates a “manmade factor affecting [the gray wolf’s] continued existence.”

Molloy wrote that negative public attitudes are “undisputedly expressed in the legislative bodies governing Montana and Idaho,” and said Fish and Wildlife did not consider how those attitudes would impact state commitments to maintaining minimum populations of wolves needed to prevent relisting. 
“Management of Canis lupus must not be by a political yo-yo process,” Molloy wrote. 
According to court filings by the state of Montana and Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the Legislature’s “liberalized methods of take with an overall intent to reduce the wolf population,” did not remove the ability of the wildlife agency to set its own rules based on scientific data. 
The state and Fish, Wildlife and Parks also highlighted the fact that the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission has maintained bag limits and required a single license per wolf for hunters, and one license per 10 wolves for trappers. However, the new 2025 proposal from Fish, Wildlife and Parks significantly increases bag limits, allowing hunters and trappers to kill up to 15 wolves on a single hunting or trapping license, for up to 30 total wolves.
In the 2024 decision not to apply endangered species status to wolves, Fish and Wildlife acknowledged that high harvest rates in Idaho and Montana could reduce state populations by 80% to 90%, resulting in “fewer than 100 wolves in each state.”
Ultimately, Molloy agreed with the plaintiff’s arguments that Fish and Wildlife did not adequately consider the future of the gray wolf under the most drastic human-caused mortality scenarios, nor the political climate that could add pressure to states to continually increase hunting and trapping opportunities. Those changes could lead to the species requiring federal protections again, Molloy wrote. 
“Wildlife management agencies are likely to find themselves in a Catch-22 as they cannot escape from mutually conflicting dependent conditions: If the federal agency succeeds in restoring the gray wolf, leading to delisting, then the state agencies will depredate the wolf, leading to relisting, engendering a fruitless cycle of delisting and relisting,” Molloy wrote.
He also agreed that Fish and Wildlife did not consider the extent of the wolf’s historic range — which includes a majority of the western states — in considering whether it met the ESA definition of endangered or threatened in “a significant portion of its range.”
The ruling sent the decision on the petition to relist gray wolves back to the agency. 
The Daily Montanan asked officials at Fish and Wildlife about a timeline for reconsidering the petition, or a possible appeal of Molloy’s ruling, but an agency spokesperson said the agency does not comment on litigation. 
The conservation organizations that sued the federal government included the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, Western Watersheds Project, WildEarth Guardians, International Wildlife Coexistence Network, Predator Defense, Protect the Wolves, Trap Free Montana, Wilderness Watch, Alliance for the Wild Rockies and others. 
“Wolf recovery is dependent on responsible management by the states, and Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have shown that they’re grossly unsuited to manage the species,” Nick Gevock, Sierra Club northern Rockies campaign strategist, said in a press release. “Judge Molloy’s ruling means now the Fish and Wildlife Service must go back to the drawing board to determine whether federal management is needed to ensure wolves survive and play their vital role in the ecosystem.”

,West Virginia Watch,2025-08-07 20:42:28+00:00,West Virginia Watch,"WV charter schools will accept religious exemptions to vaccines, siding with Morrisey",Amelia Ferrell Knisely,,,,,https://westvirginiawatch.com/2025/08/07/wv-charter-schools-will-accept-religious-exemptions-to-vaccines-siding-with-morrisey/,West Virginia’s public charter school system will advise its schools to accept religious exemptions to the state’s mandatory vaccination policies if the student’s request is approved by state health officials.,"Inside a Kanawha County elementary classroom in West Virginia. (Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)West Virginia’s public charter school system will advise its schools to accept religious exemptions to the state’s mandatory vaccination policies if the student’s request is approved by state health officials.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey and the state’s public school system are at odds over the issue. The Republican governor issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions to its school vaccination laws. He based the order on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.
The state’s school immunization law hasn’t changed, and the state school board said earlier this summer that they wouldn’t comply with Morrisey’s executive order. They instructed county boards of education to require all vaccines and allow only medical exemptions.
On Thursday, members of the West Virginia Professional Charter Schools Board voted to direct executive director James Paul to communicate to the state’s seven charter schools that they should accept vaccination waivers obtained through the state health department. Under Morrisey’s order, a medical professional’s signature is not required to obtain a religious and philosophical exemption.
The charter school board’s decision followed advice from Sean Whelan, an attorney for Morrisey, who said that the state’s mandatory vaccination law should be considered alongside the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act. Whelan said it hadn’t been enforced in this area until now. 
“EPRA creates a personal and private right of action for parents and students who feel like their religious objections are being ignored and the state laws are defying their religious beliefs,” Whelan said. “The governor is looking for partnership in this area and support in applying the Equal Protection for Religion Act.”
He continued, “We asked for a similar partnership from the State Board of Education, and certainly what we got in response was not that. So, I think a different direction from the charter school board would certainly be appreciated.”
In contrast, Jack Willems, an assistant attorney general who advises the charter school board, urged the board to maintain the state’s current strict vaccination rules due to his interpretation of how state and federal religious freedom laws intersect with immunization policies. 
“It’s not just standing with the state Board of Education. It’s also standing with the Legislature, which has rejected carving out a religious exemption to the compulsory vaccination mandate,” he said. 
Earlier this year, the GOP-heavy House of Delegates opted not to approve a bill that would have changed the state’s vaccination law to permit religious exemptions. 
West Virginia had been one of five states in the country that didn’t allow families to be exempted from school vaccination requirements based on their religious or philosophical beliefs. The strict immunization rules have contributed to the state having one of the nation’s highest rates of fully-vaccinated kindergarten students.
In late July, a Raleigh County judge sided with Morrisey and his executive order, granting a  preliminary injunction for three families seeking vaccinations exemptions on religious grounds. The parents had filed suit against Raleigh County schools over the issue.
The judge ruled that the state’s mandatory school vaccine law is invalid without a religious exemption to the law. 
“No family should be forced to choose between their faith and their children’s education, which is exactly what the unelected bureaucrats on the state Board of Education are attempting to force West Virginians to do,” Morrisey said in his statement after the ruling.
In response to the ruling, the West Virginia Board of Education emphasized that the ruling is limited to the families involved in the suit and will not apply to other families in Raleigh County or throughout the state. The state school board hasn’t yet announced their next steps as students return to classrooms this month.
As of June, the state Department of Health said it had processed 140 religious exemptions for the 2025-2026 school year under Morrisey’s executive order. At 140, the number of exemptions would still be a tiny fraction of the total number of school age children in the state, estimated at more than 250,000.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/062923_KanawhaCoSchools_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 16:56:28.623508

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Campaigns for and against a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution allowing direct election of justices to the Kansas Supreme Court have begun the one-year charge to the August 2026 primary election where the issue will be decided.
While Attorney General Kris Kobach lauded the potential switch to statewide elections at an Americans for Prosperity-Kansas dinner in Wichita, a panel of skeptics brought together by Kansas Appleseed outlined Wednesday for an audience on the University of Kansas campus the reasons it would be a mistake to abandon the existing merit-based selection process.
Retired Kansas Supreme Court Justice Carol Beier, who served on the high court from 2003 to 2020, said opening the process up to expensive popular elections financed by special interests was contrary to the idea of an independent judiciary. Vague language of the amendment in terms of the process for electing justices to had yet to be clarified by the Legislature, she said.
“It is exceedingly vague,” she said. “It will be decided by the Legislature. Do you trust them?”
Mark Tallman, who lobbied for three decades at the Capitol and continues to work with the Kansas Association of School Boards, said the state Constitution mandated the Legislature make suitable provision for the financing of public education. Four major lawsuits over the past 60 years delved into constitutionality of school aid and the Supreme Court weighed into each of those disputes, he said.
He said the current school funding formula for K-12 public schools was due to expire in 2027 and substantive changes could trigger more lawsuits likely to work their way to the Supreme Court.
“Those who have been active in our association fundamentally believe that the system works and we shouldn’t risk change,” Tallman said.
Teresa Woody, litigation director of the advocacy organization Kansas Appleseed, said it would be impossible for elections of Supreme Court justices to be anything other than partisan brawls. She said the current system properly relied on candidates submitting applications, the selection of three finalists by an independent commission and appointment of new justices by a Kansas governor.
“It will work much better than the best iteration of a (proposed) constitutional amendment in really protecting Kansans’ rights,” Woody said. “Judges are there to interpret the law, not to make the law.”
Conventional wisdom says the amendment on next year’s ballot was the creation of conservative politicians frustrated with Supreme Court decisions leading to increases in state funding of K-12 public schools and declaring women had a constitutional right to abortion.
Steady reshuffling of the Supreme Court at the ballot box could influence judicial review of those poignant issues, but the Supreme Court also could assume a transformative role in voting rights and capital punishment cases.
“The Legislature appears to believe that partisan judges are likely to side with them on certain issues regardless of the rule of law,” Woody said. “They’re trying to change the rules of the game to be more favorable to those special interests and not to the general citizens of Kansas.”
Meanwhile, Kobach said he was pleased to be with AFP-Kansas to kick off of the campaign to gain voter approval for the judicial selection amendment. The amendment was endorsed by two-thirds majorities of the House and Senate. To be added to the state constitution, a simple majority of people casting votes on the August 2026 issue would resolve whether the amendment was added or discarded.
“People, not only lawyers in smoke-filled back rooms, should have a voice in selecting Kansas Supreme Court justices,” Kobach said.
In the past, Kobach said, adoption of the constitutional amendment would enable Kansans to reclaim the right to vote for justices.
“Polling shows that Kansans overwhelmingly prefer voting on Supreme Court justices to the status quo,” Kobach said. “Seventy-four percent support the direct election of Supreme Court justices, while only 20% like the current attorney-controlled system.”
In Kansas, the merit-based selection process used to fill the seven seats on the Supreme Court relied on work of a nominating commission. It has nine members, with five elected by attorneys who passed the state bar exam. The four nonlawyers are appointed by the governor.
Commission interviews with candidates and the voting by commission members are open to the public and livestreamed on the internet. On Thursday, Gov. Laura Kelly selected a new justice to the Supreme Court by choosing from among three finalists nominated by the commission. She could have rejected all three nominees, which would have returned it to the nominating commission for a redo.
“It’s an ultra-rigorous vetting process. I’ve been through it myself,” said Beier, who was appointed to the Kansas Court of Appeals by Republican Gov. Bill Graves and to the Supreme Court by Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
Appellate judges and justices in Kansas must stand every six years for retention elections by Kansas voters.
In 2013, GOP Gov. Sam Brownback and the Legislature agreed to alter state law to replace the merit-based process for vacancies on the Court of Appeals with a system of appointment by the governor subject to confirmation by the Kansas Senate. Kelly has voluntarily made use of merit selection as she submitted Court of Appeals nominees to the Senate.
Brownback couldn’t use statute to amend the selection method for the Supreme Court because the structure was embedded in the Constitution.
Woody said rural voters ought to be wary of the proposed constitutional amendment because a majority vote would be applied to candidates for the Supreme Court. Kelly won reelection as governor in 2022 by winning fewer than 10 of the state’s 105 counties. That outcome suggested a cluster of urban centers — perhaps Johnson, Douglas, Wyandotte, Sedgwick and Riley counties — could dictate who sat on the Supreme Court.
Beier said legislative and executive branch politicians by their nature were expected to declare policy preferences and allow voters to hold accountable to their personal pledges and the platforms of political parties.
She said judges and justices should operate in a manner that concentrated on facts in evidence, weighed issues raised by participants and took into account laws enacted by government.
“Nowhere in that did you hear judges should worry about their popularity,” Beier said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tallman-Woody-and-Beier-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-07 16:56:28.623508

(Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline) The North Carolina State Board of Education has approved a five-year strategic plan to make the state’s public schools the best in the nation by 2030. The ambitious plan sets targets across eight key areas for the state’s 1.5 million public school students. 
The “Achieving Educational Excellence” initiative establishes what officials are calling “best in nation” benchmarks. These include matching the highest-performing state’s four-year high school graduation rate and composite ACT scores. Specifically, the plan seeks a 92% graduation rate and an average ACT composite score of 20 by 2030. As of 2023-24 school year, North Carolina’s adjusted four-year graduation rate is 86.9%, and the average ACT composite score is 18.5, placing the state 10th among 17 states and Washington, D.C. where 75% or more of high school students take the ACT. 
The plan also seeks to increase participation in Advanced Placement courses, dual enrollment, and career and technical education. It aims for a 30% AP participation rate in the advanced courses and a 75% AP exam pass rate with a score of 3 or higher by 2030. In 2024, 21.5% of North Carolina’s students in grades 10-12 took at least one AP exam, and 65.4% earned a qualifying score of 3 or higher, according to the report. 
Last school year, students in the state earned a record-high 358,069 Career and Technical Education credentials; the plan calls for increasing the number earned yearly to 500,000 by 2030. 
“This plan is bold, ambitious and deeply intentional,” said Geoff Coltrane, senior director of government affairs and strategy at the Department of Public Instruction. “It sets out a commitment to our students, our educators and the entire state of how we’re going to make sure that our public school system is the best in the nation.”
The plan was developed after a statewide listening tour by state Superintendent “Mo” Green that included eight regional meetings, 16 school visits and input from more than 5,000 residents, including 1,000 educators. The plan was further refined with feedback from universities, community colleges, local school boards and education associations over a two-month revision period.
The goals of the plan are organized around eight pillars, including preparing students for life after graduation, supporting educators, and ensuring safe learning environments. A key focus is on recruiting, retaining and compensating educators. It sets a target to raise beginning and average teacher salaries to the highest in the Southeast. The plan also proposes establishing a State Board of Education task force to create a more transparent educator licensing system with multiple pathways into the profession, including apprenticeship models and mentoring opportunities. 
For students, the plan focuses on character development alongside academic achievement. It notes that character education is currently not measured uniformly across the nation and that a new student-centered metric will be developed. The plan also calls for expanding school-based health services and implementing “community school” models that connect families with local resources. 
Several board members praised plan, including the outreach process that shaped it.
Board member Dr. Olivia Oxedine also praised the plan but raised several concerns, including costs. “How much is this plan going to cost?” she asked? “We may not have the exact figures today… but if we could get somewhere in the ballpark, I think that would be important.” Oxedine suggested financial details be included either in a standalone document or within each of the plan’s eight pillars.
She also noted the lack of a “policy section” outlining how the plan would be revised over time. She also questioned many of the plan’s measures, saying they “continue to feel like actions, not measures.” A true measure, she said, should serve as a “benchmark point” for comparison and estimated that “at least 50%” of the listed measures were actually actions. Green assured her that her feedback would be taken into account. 
The plan will be officially launched on Aug. 20, with promotional events scheduled across the state this fall. 
“This plan is your plan. It is our plan,” Green said. “I look forward to North Carolinians making this plan successful.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7318-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-07 16:56:28.623508

Tony Evers wrote to the federal Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, urging the Trump administration not to cancel Wisconsin’s $62.4 million grant to install solar energy systems for low- and moderate-income households.
Evers’ letter to EPA administrator Lee Zeldin followed a New York Times report earlier this week that the agency was preparing to cancel the $7 billion federal “Solar for All” grant program. “Solar for All” was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed by congressional Democrats and signed by then-president Joe Biden.
“To be clear, attempting to terminate Solar for All grants has no legitimate purpose or justification,” Evers wrote. “Beyond that, doing so will also negatively impact Wisconsinites and our state, causing increased energy bills for Wisconsinites and hurting efforts to improve air quality, boost resilience, and create good-paying jobs.”
The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. has put out a request for proposal seeking an implementer for the state’s program, called “PowerUp Wisconsin.” Bidders were to submit a notice of their intent to bid by this past Monday, Aug. 4, and final proposals are due on Friday, Aug. 29.
According to the WEDC’s work plan for the project, Wisconsin’s grant would add rooftop solar power systems to 1,038 households in single-family homes and 2,200 more households in 24 multifamily homes. The plan also calls for 10 community solar projects that could serve an additional 4,239 households.
Evers told Zeldin in the letter that since Wisconsin’s $62.4 million grant was awarded in April 2024, the WEDC has worked with local governments, solar installers, utilities and housing developers to draw up the state’s program guidelines. The program would reduce Wisconsin’s reliance on out-of-state energy and save households up to $500 a year on their energy bills, Evers wrote.
The governor wrote that lowering costs has been “a top priority” for his administration.
“While the Trump Administration claims to share this priority, terminating Wisconsin’s Solar for All grant would have the exact opposite effect, preventing Wisconsin families and households from seeing the direct savings offered through PowerUp Wisconsin,” Evers wrote.
The Evers administration and the Wisconsin Department of Justice have joined a number of lawsuits to block Trump administration executive orders and unilateral actions to cut funding approved by Congress.
Evers’ letter appeared to leave open the prospect for more litigation. “At a time when energy demand continues to increase, it is unfathomable for the Trump Administration to unnecessarily — and potentially illegally — terminate funding for a program designed to deploy affordable, renewable energy systems,” Evers wrote.

Article Summary

Dozens of Democratic lawmakers from Texas are staying in Illinois to prevent the Texas Legislature from adopting a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan for political purposes.
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, says the FBI has accepted his request to help locate the missing lawmakers.
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker says the FBI has no jurisdiction because the Texas lawmakers are not breaking any federal laws.
Pritzker won’t rule out the possibility of asking state lawmakers here to redraw Illinois’ congressional map if Texas Republicans follow through with their plan.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker brushed aside suggestions Thursday that FBI agents could be deployed to arrest a group of Texas Democratic lawmakers who have fled to Illinois to delay voting on a mid-decade Republican redistricting plan.
Pritzker’s comments came amid escalating tensions over the Texas redistricting drama. Earlier in the day, according to the New York Times, Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas, said the FBI had agreed to his request to help locate the absent Texas lawmakers.
“Look, I’ve said it before. This is a lot of grandstanding by the Trump administration, by John Cornyn, by Governor (Greg) Abbott in Texas,” Pritzker told reporters after cutting a ribbon to officially open the Illinois State Fair. “The reality is that all that he has said, Cornyn, is that the FBI has been authorized to locate the Texas House Democrats, nothing more. And you know why? Because there is no federal law that allows them to arrest Texas Democrats who are here visiting the state of Illinois.”
“I welcome the FBI coming to the state,” he continued. “I hope they take in the State Fair. I hope they go see the beauty of Lake Michigan. … But they won’t be arresting anyone because there is no U.S. federal law that prohibits those Texas House Democrats from being here in the state of Illinois.”
The drama began Sunday when dozens of Democratic members of the Texas House left the state while the Texas Legislature was meeting in a special session that was called primarily to respond to devastating floods that struck the central part of the state in July, leaving more than 100 people dead.
However, at the urging of President Donald Trump, the Republican-controlled legislature is also considering a congressional redistricting plan that is designed to give Republicans an additional five seats in the U.S. House.
Republicans currently hold a slim majority in the House: 219-212, with four seats vacant. Increasing the GOP’s margin among the Texas delegation could help Republicans from losing control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections.
But the idea of drawing new maps midway between federal censuses, solely for the purpose of gaining more partisan advantage, has sparked protests and threats of retaliation from leaders of Democratic-leaning states like Illinois and California.
Enacting a new congressional map for Illinois in time for the 2026 elections would be difficult. Democratic and Republican candidates for state and federal offices began circulating nominating petitions Tuesday, Aug. 5.
It would also be hard for Democrats to gain any more advantage in Illinois since they already hold 14 of the state’s 17 congressional districts.
But speaking to reporters Wednesday, Pritzker would not rule out the possibility of drawing new maps for Illinois if Texas Republicans follow through with their plans.

“It’s never too late,” he said. “And the truth is that we’re going to think about all the options. We’ve already taken one of those options. … About six weeks ago, I talked about the possibility that Texas House Democrats would, in fact, have to leave their state. And I made it clear to them, as I have for the last six weeks, that they’re welcome in the state of Illinois.”
Illinois lawmakers are scheduled to return to the Statehouse Oct. 14 for the start of their annual fall veto session. But Pritzker said Thursday he had not yet had any specific discussions with legislative leaders about taking up a mid-decade redistricting plan.
“The only brief conversations that I’ve had about it have been about the fact that we’ve got to do everything we can. And we’re all looking for the right avenues. And let me be clear: We already have taken an enormous step. We have welcomed those Texas House Democrats to the state of Illinois. That is a big step.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Legislature appears to be on board with Gov. Ron DeSantis stated desire to convene a mid-decade redistricting process this year.
House Speaker Daniel Perez announced on Thursday that he is creating a Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting, with the goal of conducting hearings when the Legislature returns this fall for their already scheduled committee meetings.
“As many of you are aware, there are national conversations ongoing in other states related to midterm redistricting,” Perez wrote in a memo to members of the Florida House.
“Here in Florida, our state supreme court’s recent decision in Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Institute Inc. v. Secretary, Florida Department of State, raises important and distinct questions about the applicability and interpretation of certain provisions of the so-called “Fair Districts” provisions of the Florida Constitution and their intersection with Federal law.
“Exploring these questions now, at the mid-decade point, would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our supreme court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.”
Republicans hold 20 of the 28 congressional seats in the Florida House of Representatives following the latest reapportionment in 2022. The Florida Supreme Court last month upheld DeSantis’ hand-crafted map that ultimately netted Florida four additional GOP seats and eliminated Black representation in North Florida.
Writing for the majority in that case, Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz concluded that legislators had a “superior” obligation to follow federal equal-protection law, and not the Fair Districts Amendments, which say districts can’t be drawn in a way that diminishes the ability of minorities to “elect representatives of their choice.” 
The Fair Districts Amendments were approved by 63% of the voters in 2010. (There were two separate amendments on the ballot — one regarding legislative redistricting and one for congressional redistricting). Moreover, a reapportionment plan or individual district cannot be drawn “with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or incumbent.”
Orlando Democratic House Rep. Anna Eskamani called Perez’ memo “deeply troubling.”
“Redrawing Congressional maps outside of the standard post-census cycle threatens fair representation, undermines the intent of our democratic system, and risks silencing our diverse communities,” she said in a written statement.” We will do everything in our power to fight back on these efforts, reject partisan gerrymandering, and uphold the principles of transparency and equal justice for Florida voters.”
The idea of redistricting congressional seats in Florida was not on the minds of Florida legislators nor DeSantis when the legislative session took place this year, or even as recently as when the governor signed the budget at the end of June.
Texas begins the arms race
But that all changed after President Donald Trump, concerned Republicans could lose control of the House of Representatives after next year’s midterm elections, called on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last month to add new GOP seats in his state in a rare mid-decade redistricting, which Abbott was initially opposed to doing, according to reporting by the Texas Tribune.
Once Abbott agreed to do that, however, the gears began working in other states — blue and red — to follow suit.
DeSantis publicly discussed the idea for the first time on July 22, saying during a press conference in Bradenton that he believes the state was “malapportioned.”
“So, I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade,” he wondered aloud. “So, we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you, just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five year period. It’s been really significant.”
DeSantis said the following week that the U.S. Department of Commerce had considering doing a mid-decade new Census count, something President Trump called for Thursday.
“I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures, and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024, Trump wrote on Truth Social. “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” the president added.
Genesis Robinson, executive director of Equal Ground, a Black-led voting organization, said the U.S. Census is “not a political tool for any administration to manipulate for partisan advantage.”
“For conservative states like Florida and Texas to stand by, waiting to seize on this unlawful order from their authoritarian-in-chief to upend our democracy, is shameful,” he added.
Governors in blue states such as California and New York have said they may call for their own redistricting to keep up with Republicans, creating an arms race of sorts when it comes to the mid-decade redistricting plans across the country.
 Members considering a run for Congress need not apply
In his memo, Perez said he would not appoint to the select committee any member of the Florida House who has expressed an interest in running for Congress.
He added that while they are free to express their opinions on the issue, “statements about redistricting that suggest an intent to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party, which is currently prohibited by the Florida Constitution, will also disqualify you from consideration.”
Members of the Florida House have until next Friday, Aug. 15, to email Perez indicating their interest in serving on the select committee.  There has been no word from the Florida Senate about a similar panel being convened there.

Santiago/Getty Images)Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.
But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.
The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

But it’s not.
With the enhanced advanced premium tax credits for so-called “Obamacare” plans set to expire at the end of this year, the public relations firm Red Hills Consulting created “Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care.”
The firm is launching a letter-writing campaign with the goal of encouraging Florida’s congressional delegation to support extension of the enhanced premium tax credits that help millions of Florida residents purchase Obamacare health plans.
“Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care is a campaign to raise awareness about the enhanced premium tax credits and the devastating consequences to our state if Congress allows them to expire at the end of this year,” Amanda Bevis, representing the effort, said.
Since its passage in 2020, the ACA has included advanced premium tax credits to help offset the costs of health insurance policies sold through the federal health exchange (healthcare.gov) for people with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level — which in 2025 was $126,800 for a family of four.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Congress increased the subsidies and allowed people who earn more than 400% of the poverty level to qualify. Congress the following year extended the enhanced tax credits through the end of 2025.
To date, Congress has not agreed to extend the credits. This new organization would like to see that change.










More than 4.6 million Floridians depend on the tax credits to help pay for their private health care coverage, and if Congress does not act to extend them, Floridians will lose access to care and our economy will suffer.


– Amanda Bevis, Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care


“Tax credits help small business owners afford coverage so they can focus on growing their business, creating jobs, and investing in Florida’s economy,” the group’s website says. “If they expire, Florida could lose $5.5 billion in state GDP and 49,000 jobs.”
The numbers are large because Florida leads the nation in the number of people who purchase insurance through the federal exchange.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data from March show that of the 4.7 million Florida residents with an Obamacare plan in 2025, 4.6 million receive advanced premium tax credits. Because of those credits, 2.3 million enrollees pay less than $10 a month for their health insurance. On average, the data show, the monthly Obamacare premium in Florida is $67.
Only Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas (all of which have lower Obamacare enrollment) have lower average monthly premiums.
Florida Health Justice Project (FHJP) says if the enhanced premium tax credits are eliminated there would be a 75% increase in health insurance costs for ACA enrollees in families who earn more than 400% of the poverty level. That means a family of four earning more than $126,000 could wind up with a $9,000 a year premium increase. FHJP believes health care is a “human right” and  advocates, educates, and, when necessary, litigates for its cause.
Meanwhile, FCAHC plans a roundtable discussion next week in Tallahassee to highlight the importance of the credits to Florida’s economy.
The event will feature Associated Industries of Florida President and CEO Brewster Bevis, Florida Hospital Association President and CEO Mary Mayhew, President and CEO of Florida Association of Community Health Centers Jonathan Chapman, and President and CEO of the Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Julio Fuentes.
“More than 4.6 million Floridians depend on the tax credits to help pay for their private health care coverage, and if Congress does not act to extend them, Floridians will lose access to care and our economy will suffer. This roundtable is an opportunity for a wide range of voices to share their perspectives,” FCAHC’s Amanda Bevis said.

Aug. 7, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceFor Democratic State Rep. Mai Xiong, the struggle against ICE human rights abuses and the deportations affecting the nation’s immigrant communities are hitting closer to home.
Xiong is currently working on behalf of the family of 15 Hmong immigrants who made their home in the United States decades ago but are now facing deportations following a July 30 ICE roundup in Detroit.
In a news conference held Thursday outside the Michigan Capitol, Xiong said that she and others are doing what they can and working with attorneys to free those individuals from detention centers before they can be deported. Xiong was joined in that fight by fellow Democrats, including state Sen. Stephanie Chang of Detroit, state Sen. Sam Singh of East Lansing and state Rep. Emily Dievendorf of Lansing.
Xiong said the federal government’s immigration policies and priorities were misplaced, and that those being targeted were active and respected members of their communities.
 “Instead of our federal leaders focusing on policy changes to reform the immigration system, they are throwing billions of dollars into hiring more ICE officers while providing sign-on bonuses to snatch people,” Xiong said. “We are going to see more detainments, more deportations. If you are not upset, you should be.”
The most recent ICE activity in Michigan is personal for Xiong: the representative from Warren is a Hmong American who was born in a refugee camp in Thailand before immigrating to the U.S. when she was three-years-old.
Hmong people are an ethnic group originating from Mongolia with a noted diaspora into Southeast Asia, particularly Laos and Thailand. Hmong served as key recruits by the CIA during the Vietnam War fighting the Johnson and Nixon administrations’ secret war in Laos and supporting anti-communist forces.
Many Hmong immigrants were either born in refugee camps or fled to the U.S. directly to escape war and political strife. That’s made them easy targets for deportations under the new Trump regime but with few options for sending them what the administration views as their country of origin, mainly because the U.S. and Laos lack a formal repatriation agreement for deported individuals. 
By proxy, Hmong are considered stateless people if deported because Laos, in particular, has said for years that they will not take them back because it doesn’t view them as citizens. Those born in refugee camps in Thailand have faced similar situations, as the country has recently moved to label them also as illegal immigrants ripe for deportation enforcement.
Although the administration of President Donald Trump promised to focus its immigration enforcement activities on hardened criminals and gang members, scores of people this year without criminal histories have been rounded up and disappeared from their communities – all in the name of purging the nation of immigrants.
While many of those individuals have been immigrants of a Latin origin, several other ethnic groups have been targeted in ICE raids and deportations, including Americans of African, Middle Eastern and Asian descent.
Xiong said ICE’s gaze has now turned to hardworking and community-focused members of the Hmong community in Michigan. A rally is planned for Friday in support of Hmong Michiganders who were recently nabbed by ICE under the pretext of routine immigration interviews.
ICE also is in the process of deporting Lue Yang, a 47-year-old St. Johns resident, who Xiong described as a pillar of his community. Yang came to the U.S. as an asylum seeker in the late 1970s and pleaded guilty as an accessory to a home invasion when he was young. He has since turned his life around, raised a family and became a leader among Hmong in Michigan.
His prior guilty plea, however, was offered and accepted without much legal assistance or an explanation of how it would affect his immigration status in his later years. The situation has left him unable to secure a green card through spousal sponsorship, and has now ensnared him in ICE’s grip.
Yang is being held in the recently reopened North Lake ICE facility in Baldwin. He was one of the few who was nabbed in a voluntary check in with immigration officials on July 15. The others who were detained on July 30 were duped, Xiong said, with vague letters from immigration officials saying they just wanted to conduct interviews. Several were processed in Baldwin and later moved to Texas then Louisiana, which is believed to be their final destination in the U.S. before being deported to Laos.
“Most of these individuals have never been to Laos or were not born there,” she said. “Their parents fled Laos because of war and persecution.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Aside from the lack of a cooperation agreement between Laos and the U.S., Trump’s travel ban to and from Laos has complicated the situation. Xiong said it is advocates’ working theory that the Trump administration has sanctioned Laos in order to secure backroom deals for the country to accept new deportees.
“Refugees living in Michigan do not have a safe country to return to. Michigan is their home,” Xiong said. “This is where their families and communities and workplaces are. I hope that my constituents will understand that tearing families apart, removing taxpayers and workers from our communities, placing them in private for-profit detention centers funded by our public dollars, and deporting them when they have been longtime residents of our state is not good economic policy.”
Yang’s wife, Ancy Vue, spoke alongside Xiong at length and shared her husband’s story. Vue said he is a good man who works tirelessly to support and raise his family, and that his good health was deteriorating fast. She is not allowed to see him often and is under tight restrictions when she is allowed.
Aside from the effect ICE has had on her own family, Vue said targeting Hmong people, after fighting for American freedom overseas and helping build a vibrant social patchwork in communities across the nation, the Trump administration was breaking a long held promise to Hmong immigrants to protect them.
“Please help me and our families in the many that are suffering, there are many that have not heard from their loved ones since detainment and being transferred. This is our home,” Vue said. “These are our children. This is my husband, and this is our fight. Let him come home, let our families be whole again, and let America keep its promise.”
One avenue to get Yang and others home is to challenge the legality of the warrants and arrests used to detain them, including the rapid transfer of those detainees to different facilities to obfuscate their whereabouts.
Aisa Villarosa, an attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, said that by ending opportunities for fair immigration proceedings, detaining both immigrants and citizens, and taking people into custody without giving them a chance to confer with an attorney, the Trump administration has made its priorities clear.
“None of us are safe when families are ripped apart. We call on state and local officials to stand firmly for due process,” Villarosa said. “Now is the time for our leaders to do everything they can to protect us, including our immigrant and refugee neighbors.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250807_102011-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-07 16:56:28.623508

(Benjamin Chase/for South Dakota Searchlight)Four communities in South Dakota abruptly lost their newspapers this week, leaving more than 40,000 people without a local source of print news – at least in the near term.
Employees of the Huron Plainsman, Redfield Press, Brookings Register and Moody County Enterprise, which served the city of Flandreau, were informed in a Wednesday letter that operations would cease immediately. 
“The decision was not made lightly,” read the letter from the papers’ Illinois-based parent company, News Media Corp. “Over the past months and years, we have explored every possible avenue to sustain our operations and preserve our team.”
An attempt to sell the company failed, the letter says, leaving the company in a financial position “where continuing business is no longer feasible.”
Despite challenges, newspapers still the best source for local news

Last year, the company announced it would be purchased by Carpenter Media Group, which specializes in rural papers.
News Media Corp. will make “reasonable efforts” to deliver final paychecks, the letter says. Health insurance benefits “will be terminated effective August 6, 2025,” it says, referencing the day the letters were delivered.
The company owns 31 newspapers across Arizona, Illinois, South Dakota, Nebraska and Wyoming, as well as six “shoppers,” which are freely distributed advertising publications. One such shopper, the Payday, was printed for Huron, on the same printing press used for the Plainsman and the Redfield Press.
An email to the company’s CEO, J.J. Tompkins, went unanswered. A message to the company’s informational email address came back undeliverable. A message to Carpenter Media Group on the hoped-for merger was not returned.
‘Gut-punch’ for journalism
The Wednesday announcements amount to “a real gut punch for community journalism in South Dakota,” according to South Dakota NewsMedia Association Executive Director Dave Bordewyk.
“I feel bad about it, I’m sad about it, and I’m mad about it,” said Bordewyk, who lives in Brookings where the association is based.
Bordewyk said his immediate concerns are for the employees of the publications, particularly given the immediate loss of health insurance. Since his arrival as executive director in 1995, Bordewyk said he’s known of a few instances when a small-town paper announced an instant end to operations, but he can’t recall any immediate shutdown across multiple communities at once.
The suddenness also has implications for the communities served by the papers.
“It’s revenue, expenses, bottom lines, I get that,” said Bordewyk, who said around 40 South Dakota papers have closed since the mid-1990s, “but also in the newspapers, there’s a trust relationship with your community.”
“That trust has been broken here, and my hope is it can be restored,” Bordewyk said.
Legal notice issues
Ope Niemeyer, the Brookings mayor, lamented the closure notice. He said he understands that newspapers have faced challenges in the digital era, but that he wouldn’t expect a community the size of Brookings — with a population of nearly 25,000 — to lose a printed paper.
It’s especially difficult for Brookings, he said, because a local radio station laid off its news staff less than a year ago. Without the Register, Niemeyer wonders who will cover local news.
“It’s pretty much devastating for our community,” Niemeyer said.
The closures could create immediate legal problems for government entities like Niemeyer’s, as well.

Under state law, governments must designate an official legal newspaper for the publication of meeting minutes, ordinance changes, bids for goods and services and more, often on specific timelines.
State law expects local governments to find a paper within their county before looking outside of it. There are three weekly newspapers in Brookings County. The other counties affected by the closures have none.
Niemeyer said he’s already in conversations on how the city will handle its notices. If it comes down to working with a weekly paper, he said, that could slow down the speed with which the city council can make decisions that require a certain number of days between the publication of a notice and a final decision.  
“Most of the local communities only publish once a week, so we’d have to work around that,” Niemeyer said.
In an email to South Dakota Searchlight, Huron School District Superintendent Kraig Steinhoff said he was “saddened” to hear the news about the Plainsman. The paper’s coverage of students and sporting events in the district “celebrated the achievements of children and recognized the accomplishments of Huron School District employees, while also accurately reporting on the district’s business through bimonthly board meeting updates.”
The school board voted to retain the Plainsman’s designation as its legal newspaper last month.
“Over the years, I have heard from many people who lost their local newspapers comment on how fortunate Huron was to have a daily publication,” Steinhoff wrote. “It often seems that we don’t appreciate what we have until it is gone.”
Future for local news
Steinhoff also said he hopes “another company will take over the paper,” but that the district will have to learn to live without it if that doesn’t happen.
Benjamin Chase, the editor for the Plainsman, said Thursday that he and the publisher have already fielded calls from a handful of potential business partners who hope to keep the 140-year-old paper alive.
South Dakota journalism is infused with new energy and passion

The “how, what and when” are still “being worked out,” Chase said, but “there were people who reached out right away.”
In a lengthy post on Facebook, Chase said his community of 14,500 needs a local news source. He also said he understands why people want to know about refunds on their subscriptions – his 90-year-old grandmother re-upped her annual subscription last week – but his thoughts are with the employees of the newsroom and printing shop, who didn’t know as of Thursday morning if they’d get their next paycheck. 
The next scheduled payday is Friday, two days after the letters arrived.
“Huron’s paper now has more than a dozen employees who are now wondering how they will feed their families the rest of THIS month,” Chase wrote on Facebook.
Chase said he’s spoken with employees about the possibility of signing up for Medicaid for health insurance.
Josh Linehan, editor of the Brookings Register, declined to comment immediately, telling South Dakota Searchlight he can say more on Friday. 
Bordewyk said he’s fielded calls from local government officials asking about how to manage the situation with legal notices. He’s been telling them to “hold tight” and see if the communities involved can find ways to keep their print products alive. 
There are precedents for communities stepping in. In Kingsbury County, the publisher ran a story in 2020 saying he would have to shut down two weekly papers without a buyer. The local economic development corporations purchased the business and launched a new paper with the help of volunteers. A similar situation played out in Winner last year. 
Chase is hopeful that Huron will find a way to keep the local news flowing. The paper predates statehood, and at one point published as many as three editions a day.

(Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office photo)The Louisiana Department of Justice has arrested the former police chief of Golden Meadow for malfeasance in office, injuring public records and computer tampering. 
Tony Dufrene surrendered himself to authorities Wednesday after an arrest warrant was procured, Attorney General Liz Murrill said Thursday in a news release. His arrest stemmed from a request for help from the Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Office regarding allegations of official misconduct, Murril’s office said.
Golden Meadow is a small town of less than 2,000 people along Bayou Lafourche. 
According to the news release, the investigation found Dufrene had intentionally deleted more than 12 years’ worth of police records, which law enforcement officials are struggling to restore. The attorney general did not disclose the content of the records in question.
Dufrene’s alleged actions occurred just before left office after losing his November 2024 re-election bid to Michelle Lafont.

As part of Operation Robocall Roundup, Frey and all other state attorneys general are sending warning letters to 37 voice service providers, which transmit the calls, demanding they stop illegal robocalls being routed through telecom networks. They also sent letters to nearly 100 downstream providers that accept call traffic from those other providers to inform them that they are doing business with bad actors.
“Robocalls are not just a nuisance, they are a primary method for scammers to reach unwitting victims,” Frey said in a news release Thursday. “While the scammers are often out of reach of the American legal system, the companies passing these calls through are not.”
Frey went on to say that the warning letters are the first step in holding those businesses accountable to prevent would-be scammers from using state networks.
According to the attorney general’s office, the notified voice providers have not complied with Federal Communications Commission rules about responding to traceback requests nor have they registered in the robocall mitigation databases. The providers also have not filed a plan to reduce illegal robocalls on their network.
“By disregarding these simple rules, these companies are allowing robocallers onto their phone networks and then passing their calls on to other downstream providers until they reach the phones of Maine people,” the office said.
These efforts from the 51 attorneys general, which includes the District of Columbia, are part of the Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force that formed in 2022. The task force investigates and takes legal action against companies responsible for significant volumes of illegal and fraudulent robocalls across the country.

(Photo by Deidra Peaches/High Country News)Samantha Honani Molina was about 20 when KUYI-Hopi Radio first came on air. She was attending college, hours and miles from her home village, and every time she tuned in, she felt connected, hearing her community’s songs and language.
“I was struggling to find my place, because when you’re coming from the rez, you’re trying to find your space in a city or town, and there’s nothing of who you are and where you come from. You feel the sense of, not lost, but just uncertainty, and missing home and stuff like that,” said Molina. “By hearing language on the radio, it brings the sense of cultural identity that almost highlights and strengthens that — no matter where you are, even here at home. If you don’t hear yourself represented in large spaces, you’ll just get enveloped and folded into the mainstream.”
After graduating, she returned home and later became general manager of KUYI-Hopi public radio, a position she’s held for three years. Previously, she was the program director for the Hopi Foundation, the station’s radio licensee and parent nonprofit, which provides several year-round programs on topics ranging from youth leadership to community development. The station — located in Lower Sipaulovi, below Second Mesa on the Hopi Reservation in northern Arizona — made its on-air debut in 2000 and began broadcasting online in 2010. It is the only news outlet of its kind that focuses on the Hopi community, and uses the Hopi language, Hopìlavayi.
And now, as it celebrates its 25th anniversary, KUYI has to contend with the reality of losing a significant portion of its funding, possible cuts and changes to the ways it operates.
Currently, 42 Western radio stations are considered vulnerable because over 30% of their annual funding comes from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting. Twenty of those stations serve Indigenous communities and are located in the rural reaches of reservations and Alaska Native villages.
In May, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending CPB’s congressionally approved funding of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. NPR, PBS and various local stations filed lawsuits in response. In early June, Trump asked Congress to claw back the $1.1 billion it had already set aside for public media. The House of Representatives narrowly approved that legislation, which the Senate approved in mid-July despite receiving pushback from both Democrats and Republicans.
Molina said the bill would be “devastating” to KUYI.
“KUYI radio capacity is at a place where we’re able to provide all these avenues of service, which is safety, education and entertainment. We’re finally just beginning to really explore its possibilities,” Molina said. “If pulling public media funding is done, it would destabilize not only the progress made but also jeopardizes the essential safety and cultural services we provide daily.”










By hearing language on the radio, it brings the sense of cultural identity that almost highlights and strengthens that.


– Samantha Honani Molina, general manager of KUYI-Hopi Radio


The station, which has five full-time staff members and a newly built modular studio, broadcasts at 60,000 watts across northern Arizona down to Winslow as well as online on its website. CPB funding accounts for over 48% of its operating budget, according to a June 30 letter the Hopi Tribe sent to the Senate, urging it to preserve funding for public media.
Native Public Media and the National Federation for Community Broadcasters have held summits over this, and Molina said that many broadcast organizations are already planning for cuts, regardless of whether the legislation is ultimately passed.
The immediate and significant budgetary impacts are obvious, but the long-term losses and their ramifications are incalculable. Stations like KUYI provide more than news and information: They’re community hubs where Indigenous languages can thrive, a space to preserve and grow Indigenous people’s connection to their culture and their own place within the world.
At KUYI, volunteer DJs host music and news segments, often providing bilingual weather and community updates, even a “Hopi Word of the Day” that introduces new words and tells listeners how to use them in conversation — mavasta, for example, which means “to aim” in the Hopi language.
KTNN in St. Michaels, Arizona — “The Voice of the Navajo Nation” — not only broadcasts sports events and other announcements, it also delivered essential information during June’s Oak Ridge Fire, all in Diné Bizaad, the Navajo language.

In Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost community in the United States, KBRW offers an hourlong five-day-a-week program called Uqalugaat Inupiat Stories that also teaches Inupiaq words and phrases. The late Fannie Kuutuuq Akpik-Piquk gave lessons on-air, explaining that misiġarriuq means “to make seal oil from blubber.”
Every day, the Talking Drum and Language Hour show on KWSO in Warm Springs, Oregon, plays Indigenous drum music and offers language lessons featuring the Ichishkin, Kiksht and Numu languages of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs.
In 2024, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization conducted a study recommended by the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. UNESCO’s report highlighted the need for developing accessible Indigenous-produced media that provides news, entertainment and cultural programming. The report found that radio is the most widespread media and accounts for 34% of Indigenous media use. Indigenous media in general contribute significantly to the preservation and promotion of Native languages, cultural practices and traditional knowledge, helping “foster a sense of belonging and recognition.” But there are still barriers to providing Native language content on the radio, including technical hurdles, programming quotas and the heavy reliance on voluntary efforts that require long-term support.
Altogether, Indigenous radio and media help Indigenous communities engage and grow in their understanding of their language and show them how they can better connect with their culture.
Tiffany Lee, a Native American studies professor at the University of New Mexico, researches language reclamation and identity for Native youth. She promotes the benefits of immersive bilingual education for Indigenous students and adults, noting that having access to learning one’s language is key to revitalizing it.
“The number-one issue for language revitalization today is making sure our youth, our families, all have access to learning in some way and in multiple ways,” said Lee. “Just one isn’t going to work and isn’t always the best method for learning, so you need a diverse array of accessing the language and learning it.” 










If pulling public media funding is done, it would destabilize not only the progress made but also jeopardizes the essential safety and cultural services we provide daily.”


– Samantha Honani Molina, general manager of KUYI-Hopi Radio


Indigenous language use on the airwaves bolsters the other places where Native languages are spoken, including schools and other immersion language programs. Examples in the Southwest include organizations like Saad K’idilyé — of which Lee is a board member — and Hopitutuqaiki, which teach Navajo and Hopi respectively in culturally relevant ways.
For Lee, learning one’s language is not just about being able to communicate within the community.
“I have this shirt that says ‘Indigenous language education is education,’ and I love that shirt and that saying because it’s so true,” Lee said. “It’s not just learning the mechanics of speaking your language — it’s an education unto itself. You’re learning your community and your culture’s worldview; you’re learning how language is tied to cultural practice, how it is cultural practice.”
No one understands the impact of sending Indigenous languages out onto the airwaves more than Navajo radio broadcaster L.A. Williams.
Williams, who’s been a radio broadcaster for 32 years, is widely known for reporting Phoenix Suns games in Diné Bizaad, providing play-by-play commentary, making the sport more accessible for people who speak only that language. Williams said the language continues to thrive largely because of its continued use.
“We’re not losing our language,” she said. “Our language is what puts us further in life as it makes us live longer into life by knowing the Navajo language.”
Throughout her career, Williams has seen broadcast opportunities as another way of encouraging use of Diné Bizaad at home, bridging the connection between elders who are fluent and youth who lack full command of the language. This creates a connection between past and future, reminding people that tribal history and culture will continue.

Despite the national threat to public media and funding cuts’ impact on rural and tribal stations, Williams is confident of the persistence and resilience of Indigenous languages.
“As far as the language, the tradition, the culture, that goes on,” she said. “That life goes on into the future.”
Meanwhile, Molina and Lee remain hopeful that current U.S. policy, including proposed funding cuts to Indigenous public media, won’t derail the conviction and resilience of people who are determined to preserve and reclaim their traditional ways of life.
KUYI is working on seeking alternative funding and keeping stakeholders informed. And Indigenous public media organizations such as Native Public Media, Vision Maker Media and Koahnic Broadcast Corporation, attended the National Congress of American Indians mid-year conference, seeking support from the organization. 










If pulling public media funding is done, it would destabilize not only the progress made but also jeopardizes the essential safety and cultural services we provide daily.

“Thankfully, we have a good parent organization, the Hopi Foundation, who is stepping up to see how they can supplement during this loss,” Molina said. “But they can’t carry us for that long. We’ll see what they’re able to do to help us fundraise or carry us for a little bit, but it’s not going to sustain — it won’t sustain.”
Despite the uncertainties and hardship, Molina said it’s been humbling to witness the outpouring of support from other radio stations and their listeners. The station’s 25th anniversary in August serves as a reminder of what really matters.
“That’s a really pivotal point for us to reflect on,” Molina said. “Then go forward with strength and resilience, just like our people have always done. It’s an opportunity for us to really show what we can do to support something so important, and I’m really excited to see what that looks like.”

(Photo courtesy of Connecticut Siting Council)Plans to develop one of New England’s largest battery-storage facilities in the rural northeast corner of Connecticut fizzled in part due to the developer’s unease with rising tariffs and President Donald J. Trump’s rollback of federal incentives for renewable energy, according to a consultant for the project.
Applications for the proposed 325-megawatt facility in Killingly were withdrawn in June by the Israel-based developer, Sunflower Sustainable Investments. At the time, representatives for the company said little about their rationale for the move, which came less than a year after the project was submitted to the Connecticut Siting Council for approval.
But Jonathan Milley, a consultant and spokesman for the project, said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror this week that capital costs were projected to increase between 30% and 50% due to tariffs and recent changes in federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects. Those issues, combined with a rocky outlook for offshore wind and more general economic uncertainty, all contributed to the project’s demise, he said.
“It became entirely untenable,” Milley said. “It was just was much, much too risky to warrant going forward with the investment.”
The Killingly project — also known as the Windham Energy Center — had an estimated budget of $200 million and would have taken a little more than a year to build. The plans called for a series of large batteries housed in dozens of prefabricated storage containers, as well as an electrical substation connecting to nearby transmission lines.
Construction of the project would have employed up to 40 people at a time, in overlapping crews, according to documents submitted to the siting council.
Milley explained that the Killingly project was planned as a so-called “merchant” storage facility, meaning it would purchase electricity off the grid at times when renewables such as solar and wind were supplying lots of low-cost power. That electricity could then be stored and sold back onto the grid at other times, such as in the evening, when demand is higher but renewables are not operating at their peak.
In particular, Milley said the project’s developers were hoping to tap into an abundance of wind power produced by several planned turbine farms off the Atlantic Coast.
But because merchant projects operate without long-term power purchase agreements with utilities or other customers, Milley said they also carry more risk for investors. A recent downturn in the offshore wind industry that was exacerbated by the Trump administration’s opposition to wind power made the battery project even harder to pull off, he said.
The location of the proposed battery facility — on a property that had previously been slated for construction of a natural-gas-fired power plant — also added to the list of difficulties facing the developers.










It became entirely untenable. It was just was much, much too risky to warrant going forward with the investment.

The company behind the failed gas plant proposal, NTE Energy, still held a certificate of approval from the siting council to develop the property. Therefore, attorneys for Sunflower Sustainable Investments, the battery developers, had to file a separate request for the council to reopen that approval process for the purpose of resolving the issue.
Milley said that attorneys for the project initially believed the issue with the certificate would be quickly resolved, but it ended up delaying the project while the outside political and economic landscape worsened.
“This is a compendium of foreign investors looking at the situation, going around and saying, ‘You know what? This is way too much uncertainty,'” Milley said. “Any one of these things is difficult. We could have analyzed any one of them in isolation… but the compendium of everything was just too much.”
In addition to the Killingly project, Milley said that Sunflower Sustainable Investments had recently decided to terminate similar battery projects under development in Texas and South Carolina.
Ken Gillingham, an energy and environmental economist at Yale University, said that Milley’s explanation of the company’s decisions made sense given the wider challenges facing the industry under the Trump administration.
“It’s become impossible to plan right now in the renewables and battery space,” Gillingham said.
In April, Trump announced tariffs of up to 125% on Chinese goods as part of a back-and-forth series of trade threats between the two counties. While those duties were later pared back to around 30%, the Trump administration has proposed additional tariffs on specific components that go into the production of batteries, namely graphite and copper, that could significantly impact their cost. All of those tariffs remain subject to ongoing talks between the U.S. and China, and the Trump administration is expected to extend its current Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a deal, according to the Associated Press.
China dominates the market for utility-scale batteries, currently producing upwards of 80% of the world’s cells, according to Bloomberg. Other major producers include Japan and South Korea, both of which have been slapped with additional tariffs by the Trump administration.
In addition to tariffs, President Trump last month signed Congressional Republicans’ tax and spending bill that included a rollback of many existing tax credits for renewable energy projects. Those changes have roiled plans by other developers to install new, carbon-free sources of power.
“For projects that are already under construction, or just about under construction and fully permitted, they’re still moving forward right now,” Gillingham said. “But it’s that next tranche of projects, and [Killingly] was in that category, it’s pretty clear that there’s a lot of uncertainty.”
While the bill left in place tax credits for battery projects, Gillingham said that lawmakers included new requirements on applicants to source more of their materials from the United States. Depending on how strictly the federal government enforces those requirements, Gilligham said they have the potential to significantly increase the cost of future projects.
In documents submitted to the Connecticut Siting Council, the developers for Killingly facility said they planned to use batteries produced by CATL, a Chinese company whose production is almost entirely located overseas.
CATL is known for its production of lithium iron phosphate batteries, a technology that it marketed as safer alternative to more traditional lithium-ion batteries that can erupt into intense fires caused by thermal runaway. The risk of fire was one of several concerns raised by town officials in their initial response to the developer’s application with the siting council.
However, those concerns had not formed into formal opposition to the project from the town before the developers pulled their application, according to correspondence submitted to the siting council.
Killingly’s economic development director, Jill St. Clair, said in an email last month that the only explanation the developers gave to town officials was that the project was canceled due to “changing market conditions.” St. Clair did not respond to additional requests for comment this week.

The New Hanover County Commissioners voted 3-2 last month to walk away from the Workforce Housing Advisory Committee, citing city budgets cuts and concern about its effectiveness. The committee was created in 2019 to study workforce housing issues and to make recommendations to city and county officials for increasing the county’s affordable housing supply.
All but one of the council’s seven members agreed the committee’s work must continue, even without its former partner.

“I would definitely want to continue on with a new committee and how we reestablish that, I think it’s going to be extremely important,” said Mayor Bill Saffo. “I think it should be charged with some specific things that we would like to see — we’d like to see obviously an increase in the amount of units that we feel that we could put into the marketplace.”
Councilman Charlie Rivenbark, the lone dissenter, countered that the committee never lived up to expectations.
“I don’t know if this committee is the one that can carry forth and do great things or what, but it hasn’t been working,” Rivenbark said. “We just haven’t seen the results that everyone is wanting to see.”

City Council member Kevin Spears pushed back.
“I don’t want this governing body to follow that path of detrimental ideology as it relates to this community,” Spears said. “We have to keep working, we have to keep taking steps, shuffles, whatever it is, forward, not backwards. We need to keep this committee in place.”
City staffers shared a spreadsheet showing Wilmington has spent $23 million on affordable housing projects since 2022. The total cost of projects was $184.6 million with most money coming from federal sources. The city produced 2,262 housing units, 882 of which are described as workforce housing, staffers reported.
Council member Clifford Barnett said he is proud of the committee’s work.

“I would hate for us to lose that momentum, so I’m in favor of keeping the committee and adding those we need to add to it,” Barnett said. “When you go back and look at those numbers and look at the number of houses we had a chance to do and how many people we’ve had a opportunity to get into a house, I think we’ve got to do that.”
The council didn’t vote Tuesday on four options city staffers presented for moving forward. The options were to end the committee, review other avenues for engagement on housing matters, establish a new committee or create ad hoc committees to assess and make recommendations on housing needs as part of specific plans.
City Manager Becky Hawke said that at a minimum, the committee’s bylaws must be rewritten to reflect the county’s decision to leave the partnership if the city continues the committee’s work.
“We wanted to just present the options to get feedback, to see if there are other changes you would like to make or if this is a committee you no longer wish to see in this exact format, so it’s really looking for majority direction so that we can take whatever action that’s desired by council,” Hawke said.
New Hanover County backs away from commitment to affordable workforce housing

As NC Newsline reported last month, the county’s three Republican commissioners voted to end the county’s committee, contending the board must balance financial considerations and quality of life demands with the need for affordable housing.
“Our citizens overwhelmingly told us that they did not want to see their tax rate go up.” Commissioner LeAnn Pierce said. “They overwhelmingly said they were struggling at home, and they wanted us to hear them.”
Democratic commissioners Rob Zapple and Stephanie Walker voted against withdrawing from the committee and challenged colleague’s perception that the advisory committee did not perform as intended.
“In the three years since [the board agreed to spend $15 million on the workforce housing committee], we have spent $9 million and it has done exactly what you said you were not aware of,” Zapple responded. “It’s [county funding] leveraged $150 million in private investment that has gone into trying to solve this [housing] problem.”
The board’s decision to back away from the workforce housing committee comes as New Hanover County and many other counties and municipalities across the state and nation are making investments to increase housing supplies to accommodate an unprecedented demand for affordable housing. It also comes amid steep budget cuts for a county experiencing record growth.
A recent study commissioned by the North Carolina Chamber found that the state has a significant housing crisis and needs 760,000 new housing units over the next five years to meet demand across its 100 counties. According to the study, New Hanover County has a 21,656-unit housing gap when owner and renter data are combined.
Meanwhile, 34% of renters and homeowners in New Hanover County are burdened by housing costs, according the N.C. Housing Coalition’s 2025 profiles of the state’s 100 counties. Families that spend more than 30% of their income on housing are considered cost burdened.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dream-Point-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-07 15:56:53.027301

She was 88.
Bingham, who grew up in Louisville amid the wealth and influence of one of the nation’s most prominent newspaper families, had lived in Sante Fe, New Mexico, since 1991 where she continued her work as a writer, philanthropist and supporter of women’s causes.
Bingham died Wednesday at her home following a stroke, The New York Times  reported Thursday.
She was one of three children of Barry Bingham Sr. and his wife, Mary, who in 1986 shared in ownership of the family media empire that included The Courier-Journal, a morning newspaper, its afternoon affiliate, the Louisville Times, WHAS TV and radio stations and Standard Gravure, a printing company.
Bingham Sr.’s surprise announcement of the sale fractured the companies through sales to individual owners—the newspapers to current owner Gannet Co.—and the family, with Barry Bingham Jr.,, then publisher, calling the sale “a betrayal,” according to The New York Times.
But his sisters, Sallie Bingham and Eleanor Bingham were less critical.
Sallie Bingham called the sale  ”a positive thing for Louisville, Kentucky and the family”  and her sister said that it was ”a relief to get this very sad occasion past us,” according to The New York Times.
Media watchers said Sallie Bingham’s criticism of her family’s management of the media companies — including over her removal from the board — and her proposed sale of her 15% share in the family-owned company, helped trigger the sale her father said was to end the family’s dispute over control.
But in an interview with the Kentucky Lantern last year, Sallie Bingham said she believed she was unfairly blamed for her role in the sale of the Bingham companies in the flurry of media coverage about the sale and several books that followed.
‘Scapegoating’
“Other books were prejudicial to me,” she said. “There was a good deal of scapegoating.”
In her 1989 book, “Passion and Prejudice: A Family Memoir,” Bingham said she sought to portray her version of the family history and conflict that led up to the sale.
It was not well-received by her family, Bingham said. Her mother particularly objected to her mention of the death of Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, the wealthy wife of Sallie Bingham’s grandfather, John Worth Bingham, who bought the Louisville newspapers aided by his new wife’s wealth.
She died in 1917, just months after the wedding and suspicions about her death circulated afterwards. She suffered from a heart condition and while the family had an autopsy performed, the results were never disclosed, according to a 2008 article in the National Library of Medicine.
Bingham described her book on her website.
“’Passion and Prejudice,’ somewhat unfortunately subtitled, ‘A Family Memoir’—a memoir no one in my family would accept—was published by Alfred A. Knopf to much criticism; as time passed, its virtues would begin to be apparent,” she wrote in a post on her website, SallieBingham.com.
In an interview this year with Santa Fe Magazine, Bingham said her mother was furious about the book and didn’t speak to her after its publication. Her father also cut off contact, she said.
But she defended her decision in the interview.
“As a committed writer, if I compromised and said, ‘All right. I’m not going to mention Mary Lily, I really would not be able to go on writing,” she said. “I really felt it was my whole career that was on the line.”
Bingham also wrote several other books, short stories and plays, according to her website.

A foundation and a feud
After the 1986 sale of the Louisville newspapers to the Gannett media chain for $300 million, Bingham used some of her share of the proceeds to establish the Kentucky Foundation for Women, a nonprofit meant to support women artists and writers.
In a piece on her website blog, Bingham said it was her time at the newspaper that inspired her to create the foundation.
“I was aware from my years as book editor at the Courier-Journal of the amount of work that women did at the Bingham companies; almost entirely in lower-paid jobs such as distributing mail, cooking and serving in the company cafeteria, working as secretaries or cleaning,” Bingham wrote. “These women were about to lose their jobs with the sale of the company.”
Bingham decided to create and endow a foundation that would support and help fund women artists working for social change.
Bingham served as the foundation’s first director from 1985 until her 1991 move to New Mexico.
Bingham, in an interview, said she relinquished management to the board and a new executive director.
“I felt it was better, since I was not going to be living in Kentucky, not to be hovering over the foundation,” she told the Lantern.
However, her relationship with the foundation fractured last year when she filed a lawsuit against it, arguing that its attempt to sell an eastern Jefferson County farmhouse it owned went against its mission.
Bingham, in establishing the foundation, said she envisioned the farmhouse and its 10-acre site – surrounded by a farm she owned and had designated as a conservation easement — as a secluded retreat for women artists.
“Creativity demands that women be allowed to retreat, at times, from their world and their obligations,” said her lawsuit. “Hopscotch provides the setting for such retreats.”
But the foundation argued the aging farmhouse needed extensive renovation and lacked amenities, such as city water service, and had only intermittent internet access—vital to contemporary artists. Its isolation also made some artists concerned about security, it said.
Bingham originally had purchased the farmhouse, which she named Hopscotch House, and donated it to the foundation.
It’s unclear what will happen with the litigation following Bingham’s death. The case remains pending in federal court in Louisville. Bingham married and divorced three times, the Times reported.
In addition to a sister, Eleanor Bingham Miller, she is survived by two sons, Barry Ellsworth, a film producer and art gallerist, and Christopher Iovenko, a writer, and five grandchildren, according to The New York Times.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sallie-Bingham-by-Camila-Motta.jpeg,,,2025-08-07 15:56:53.027301

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A federal appeals court has upheld Oklahoma’s ban on gender-affirming procedures for minors. 
The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which represents the region of Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, found Wednesday that the Oklahoma Legislature’s 2023 ban was not intended to discriminate against transgender children. 
The unanimous ruling relied on a recent Supreme Court decision, United States v. Skrmetti, which upheld a similar Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. 
The Oklahoma Legislature passed the ban with Senate Bill 613 in May 2023. The law bans gender-affirming medical treatments for Oklahomans under 18 years old and creates a felony for health care providers who violate the ban.
A group of transgender youth, their families and a medical professional sued the state over the law with the support of Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma. The plaintiffs contended the ban violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Oklahoma Attorney Gentner Drummond celebrated the decision in a statement Thursday and said he’s “grateful the battle is now won.”
“Thanks to this critical victory, our children will no longer be subjected to the lifelong consequences of these damaging procedures,” he said. 
The Northern District of Oklahoma previously upheld the ban in October 2023, allowing the law to be enforced. 
In a joint statement Lambda Legal and the ACLU of Oklahoma said they are considering next steps but will “never stop fighting” for the future of transgender people. 
“Yesterday’s ruling is a devastating outcome for transgender youth and their families across Oklahoma and another tragic result of the Supreme Court’s errant and harmful ruling in Skrmetti,” the statement read. “Oklahoma’s ban is openly discriminatory and provably harmful to the transgender youth of this state, putting political dogma above parents, their children, and their family doctors.”
The ban “unjustly and unfairly” targets transgender youth and violates their rights, the statement said.

(Photo provided courtesy of Denver International Airport)The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is now accepting Arkansas Mobile ID at checkpoints at more than 260 airports across the country, according to a Thursday news release from the Department of Finance and Administration.
State officials in March announced the Mobile ID, which can be used in lieu of a physical license or ID. More than 30,000 Arkansans now have a Mobile ID. The state has worked with TSA on this process and testing was completed last week, according to the release. 
“The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration is focused on streamlining and improving the services we provide Arkansans,” DFA Secretary Jim Hudson said. “Using Mobile ID to board a flight will make travel easier for citizens. We encourage Arkansans who have not obtained their Mobile ID to take advantage of this innovative, free tool.”
Anyone with an existing Arkansas license or ID can obtain a Mobile ID by downloading the Arkansas Mobile ID app on their smartphone. The Arkansas Mobile ID will be available in the Google and Samsung wallets by early fall, and Apple Wallet later on, according to the release. Until then, the Mobile ID app can be presented directly to TSA. 
Mobile ID will also allow TSA to verify Arkansans are ticketed for air travel that day, so travelers don’t need to show TSA officers a boarding pass, the release states. 
“We’re pleased to see this identity verification upgrade available to Arkansas travelers,” Clinton National Airport Executive Director Steven Baker said. “We look forward to the acceptance of this technology at all commercial airports across the U.S. Until such time, we encourage travelers to also carry their physical licenses.”
More information about the ID is available on the department’s website.

(Photo by Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring those with account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
Bill would add protections for children used as content by social media influencers

The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
40 million subscribers
Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Social media experts are skeptical about the power of new state laws

Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
States step in
In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”











In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections.


– Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich



This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
For family bloggers, kids make money. A Utah lawmaker wants to make sure they’re compensated, too

Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

As part of Operation Robocall Roundup, Frey and 50 bipartisan attorneys general are sending warning letters to 37 voice service providers, which transmit the calls, demanding they stop illegal robocalls being routed through telecom networks. They also sent letters to nearly 100 downstream providers that accept call traffic from those other providers to inform them that they are doing business with bad actors. 
“Robocalls are not just a nuisance, they are a primary method for scammers to reach unwitting victims,” Frey said in a news release Thursday. “While the scammers are often out of reach of the American legal system, the companies passing these calls through are not.”
Frey went on to say that the warning letters are the first step in holding those businesses accountable to prevent would-be scammers from using state networks. 
According to the attorney general’s office, the notified voice providers have not complied with Federal Communications Commission rules about responding to traceback requests nor have they registered in the robocall mitigation databases. The providers also have not filed a plan to reduce illegal robocalls on their network. 
“By disregarding these simple rules, these companies are allowing robocallers onto their phone networks and then passing their calls on to other downstream providers until they reach the phones of Maine people,” the office said.
These efforts from the 51 attorneys general, which includes the District of Columbia, are part of the Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force that formed in 2022. The task force investigates and takes legal action against companies responsible for significant volumes of illegal and fraudulent robocalls across the country.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gettyimages-1476898701-1536x864-1-1024x5761754587739-1.jpg,,,2025-08-07 15:56:53.027301

A burgeoning faculty union at Western New Mexico University announced Wednesday that it took a “major step forward” this week after administration officials acquiesced on three sticking points that had stood in the way of a settlement agreement.
One of those sticking points was whether the embattled former president Joseph Shepard would be included in the bargaining unit, given his status as a tenured faculty member, according to a news release from the WNMU faculty union. Shepard secured that title as part of a controversial December 2024 contract that also paid him nearly $2 million in severance.
The WNMU Board of Regents on July 31 voted to undo the contract, finding that their predecessors on the board had violated the state Open Meetings Act when they approved it. 
Two lawsuits remain pending in the matter from the New Mexico Department of Justice and the State Ethics Commission. Following the board’s vote, Shepard provided a statement to Inside Higher Education, which said: “After serving 14 exemplary years of advancing the university, it’s troubling that this new, Governor-appointed Board has chosen this path. This is a matter before the courts. The Board’s desire to attempt to circumvent the legal process is telling in that they know they can’t win where facts matter and are doing all they can to prevent the truth from being shared.”
Shortly after nixing Shepard’s contract, the administration settled with the nascent WNMU faculty union, according to the news release. Now, all that remains is for the Public Employee Labor Relations Board to verify the results of the union’s membership drive. 
WNMU regents ax Joseph Shepard’s severance and teaching contract

About 70% of Western faculty voted in favor of joining a union, organizing committee member Andy Hernández told Source New Mexico on Thursday. 
“And since the university is no longer contesting the composition of the [bargaining] unit, and of course, we were very careful in collecting cards, we expect a pretty quick verification,” said Hernández, a history professor.
He said he expects the board to take up the matter by mid-September.
Christopher Maples, the interim WNMU president, told Source on Thursday in a brief phone interview that he supports the unionization effort because it enables better communication between departments and union members. 
“I think, places that have [unionized] managed to actually improve communications among themselves and between departments,” he said. “That’s always a great outcome.”
The other two sticking points were whether university librarians and faculty at WNMU’s Applied Technology department were eligible to join. Administrators ultimately agreed there, too. 
Faculty leaders initially announced the push in May, saying a recognized union would improve shared university governance after a “tumultuous year.” Shepard’s term as president ended amid revelations about how he spent university resources at the president’s mansion, among other questionable spending.
But Maples and Hernández described the new union as just the latest university-wide effort to right the ship ahead of the fall semester that begins Aug. 18. 
Maples told Source that he was already seeing a spike in activity on campus, as staff and faculty and students prepared for a new year of learning. The promise of a new semester makes it hard to be pessimistic, he said. 
“Students and faculty come back, and it just springs a new life into the university,” he said. “You can see our future. Our future is sitting in the classroom.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WNMUPresser-1.webp,,,2025-08-07 15:56:53.027301

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia said he has heard from “multiple sources” “who work inside local governments” that local officials have deleted or altered information in advance of state audits. 
Ingoglia said he was “not at liberty to say” which city or county governments the allegations target.
Those governments, Ingoglia claims, have held “some meetings with the sole purpose of scrubbing the information from public record as we start looking for some of the things that are outlined in our DOGE letters.”

Ingoglia said the scrubbed information could include “certain keywords” from documents, which would make it more difficult for auditors to search electronic records.
“Depending on what we find, we will let everyone know,” Ingoglia said Thursday morning outside Jacksonville City Hall, responding to questions about which areas the allegations encompass. “We will let people know once we find the information.”
Ingoglia said the auditors often decide their targets after people inside local governments or in government-adjacent organizations “are telling us, ‘Hey, you should look at X, Y, and Z because A, B, and C is happening.’”
“This is a warning to any local government that tries to hide the spending, try to scrub the information from government servers, that we will subpoena you and we will make sure that we get the information,” Ingoglia said. 
“In addition, if we have enough information, we are going to send in the digital forensics team from FDLE and find out who is scrubbing the information and then we may refer that over for criminal investigation.”
The Florida Department of Government Efficiency audits are modeled on the  federal model first led by billionaire Elon Musk shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term. 
Other DOGE audits have commenced in St. Petersburg, Broward County, Gainesville, Miami-Dade County, Manatee County, Pinellas County, HIllsborough County, Orange County, and the State University System.
“We have heard allegations of this from numerous sources, enough where it concerns us in the CFO’s office and the DOGE team for us to investigate it,” Ingoglia said. 
Earlier this week, Ingoglia announced a partial rebranding of the state investigative body as the Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight. That creates an acronym, FAFO, that Ingoglia was shy to share on camera before eventually sharing a more family-friendly version: 
“Fool around and find out. If you’re going to go and you’re going to be a local government and you’re going to cover things up and try to make it harder for our investigators to find things that they shouldn’t be hiding, they’re going to see the FO part of that,” Ingoglia said.

‘Red tape’
Ingoglia, in Jacksonville, made clear the state has no interest in “anyone putting bureaucratic red tape in front of us.”
This week, Ingoglia and Jacksonville Mayor Donna Deegan had a public back-and-forth, disagreeing about how the state officials would access Jacksonville’s financial records. 
“We are not going to sign a form. They’re getting the information right now. Our audits and review are not a suggestion. It’s outlined by law. There is no negotiation when we come in and we try to protect taxpayers rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse,” Ingoglia said.
The state requested information from Miami-Dade County, giving officials there about nine days to send the material.
Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava asked Ingoglia for a 30-day extension to submit documents. Ingoglia did not grant the extension.
“There is ZERO reason Miami-Dade can’t do the same,” Ingoglia wrote on social media.

Christine Beachler, library media director for Lowell Area Schools in May filed a civil suit against Moms for Liberty associate Stefanie Boone, hitting back against what Beachler described as a “smear campaign” including name calling, harassment and a flood of false statements posted to Facebook, including allegations that Beachler is providing pornography to minors. 
“It’s just really hard to talk about. That’s why I’ve actually been working from home a lot. … I mean being called a groomer, being called a pedophile, I was called a whore, a smut peddler,” Beachler said in a previous interview with the Michigan Advance. “I’ve been an educator for 37 years and how can somebody call somebody that name that has invested their life in working with kids? It’s very hurtful and obviously untrue.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Moms for Liberty advocates against school curriculums that include discussions of LGBTQ+ identities and discussions of race and racism. The group has also advocated for bans on racially inclusive books and books with LGBTQ+ content or themes.
While Boone and her attorney Matt DePerno filed a motion to have the case dismissed without a trial, Judge Christina Mims denied that request on Friday.
“We’re excited to move forward with discovery and show that the librarian is pushing porn on kids and that she peddles smut,” Deperno told the Michigan Advance on Thursday.
DePerno is a former GOP candidate for Michigan Attorney General who is also facing felony charges related to allegations he tampered with election equipment.
Beachler’s attorney, Elizabeth Geary, said they were also happy with the judge’s ruling.
“We are pleased that the court saw through Defendants’ self-promoting attacks on libraries and librarians and rejected the motion to get out from under this case. We look forward to moving forward in discovery and demonstrating the harm that Defendants’ campaign against Christine has caused,” Geary said in an email.
Boone filed her own lawsuit against Beachler, the school district and several school employees in June 2024, alleging they had violated her parental rights.

Immigrants released at the border are being targeted for arrest when they show up for court hearings. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.
But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.
The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.
Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.
ICE arrests and detentions rise steeply in Idaho

One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.
At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.
But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.
“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.

 Department of Homeland Security’s policies at the border

The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.
After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”
However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.
Lawmakers must be allowed immigration detention visits, US House Dems’ suit says

Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.
Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.
Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.
“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”
LGBTQ+ immigrants seek refuge in the U.S>
There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.
One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.

– Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association


Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)
In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.
The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.
 Arrests and deportations over the last few months

The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.
Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.
Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.
The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.
“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.
“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

The trooper killed the woman, her new boyfriend and himself last weekend. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The Hunterdon County Prosecutor’s Office took over the Franklin Township Police Department Thursday, after the family of a woman murdered by her ex-boyfriend — a New Jersey state trooper — said the department failed to respond to her reports of harassment and pleas for help.
Hunterdon County Prosecutor Renée M. Robeson said her office will supervise the force’s daily operations “until further notice.”
“HCPO has determined that supersession of FTPD is immediately necessary following its active investigation into the homicides in the Pittstown section of Franklin Township on or about August 1, 2025, which has raised serious concerns about FTPD’s operations and effectiveness,” Robeson said in a statement.
Township officials placed the department’s chief, Timothy Snyder, and Sgt. Kevin Bollaro on administrative leave, and Robeson appointed Capt. Paul Approvato as interim officer in charge.
The move comes six days after Ricardo Jorge Santos, a state police lieutenant who at one time was assigned to guard Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive team, gunned down Lauren Semanchik, 33, and her boyfriend Tyler Webb, 29, of Forked River, at Semanchik’s home in the township’s Pittsman section.
Santos and Semanchik, a veterinarian, had dated last year but broke up in September, investigators found. Semanchik subsequently reported Santos to Franklin police for “harassing and controlling behavior,” according to the prosecutor’s office.
Her sister, Deanna Semanchik, told PIX 11 that Semanchik and Santos dated for about six months and that he phoned and texted her repeatedly, vandalized her car, and hid recording devices in her home after their breakup. She told the outlet her sister reported Santos to Franklin police in May and sought a restraining order, but was told no one was there to help her, and no one returned her subsequent follow-up call.
Detectives investigating the murders this week quickly identified Santos as a suspect, thanks to those reports as well as a video surveillance system Semanchik had installed in her car, according to the prosecutor’s office. That video showed a white 2008 Mercedes SUV trailing Semanchik after she left work in Long Valley Friday evening, the office said. The camera also caught a man sneaking through a wooded area along her driveway about 15 minutes after she got home, and Webb arriving about a half hour after that, the office said.
At 7:08 p.m. Friday, someone called 911 to report audible gunshots and screaming on the road where Semanchik lived, the office said. Franklin officers responded and checked the area, but didn’t identify the source of the sounds and left.
Another 911 call came in just after noon Saturday, when an unidentified person found Semanchik unresponsive in her home, the office said. Franklin officers returned to the scene and found Semanchik and Webb, a firefighter, dead.
Santos was discovered dead later the same day in the white 2008 Mercedes SUV in a Piscataway park, the office said. Investigators found a gun in the car, and the Hunterdon County Medical Examiner’s Office determined he’d shot himself and preliminarily ruled the death a suicide.
“We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of Dr. Lauren Semanchik and Tyler Webb, whose lives were tragically taken in an act of domestic violence. This senseless and devastating loss has deeply affected our entire community,” Robeson said in a statement. “Considering the suspect’s subsequent suicide, we recognize that many questions remain, and healing will take time.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ State Board of Election Commissioners reprimanded a North Arkansas poll worker Thursday in its third meeting in three days.
Loretta Milam, who worked at Searcy County’s Witts Springs polling site during the November 2024 elections, faced allegations of electioneering. The state’s poll worker training guide defines electioneering as “the display of or audible dissemination of information that advocates for or against any candidate, issue or measure on a ballot” within 100 feet of a polling site.
The state election board voted 4-1, with dissent from commissioner James Harmon Smith, to accept the charge against Milam based on “a preponderance of evidence” from Thursday’s testimony.
Milam allegedly expressed her opinion about a measure on the 2024 ballot that repealed a Pope County casino license. She told the state election board that she had family members who were likely to get jobs at the casino if it were built, and election monitor Melissa Jackson told the board she overheard Milam saying this to a voter outside the polling site.
The voter, Colton Moore, testified on Milam’s behalf. He said he expressed excitement about the possibility of the casino being built because it would give him work as a carpenter. Milam “stayed neutral and did not say anything,” Moore said.
Milam said she remembered her encounter with Moore, but not if she said anything back to him. Her attorney, Clint Lancaster, said the state board should not fault Milam’s memory.
North Arkansas election commissioners reprimanded but not decertified over election law breaches

“If you find that Miss Milam committed electioneering without the state having gone well beyond the bare minimum, I think it would be a travesty,” said Lancaster, who also represented the Searcy County Election Commission during Wednesday’s state board hearing.
All three county commissioners received letters of reprimand for two charges of violating state election laws: accepting expensive audiovisual equipment for a fraction of the cost, which the state board said counted as an improper gift, and failing to post a full list of election workers in a public space in the county clerk’s office at least eight days before Election Day.
The state board declined to decertify the commissioners from participating in future elections or to accept two other charges against them. The board had previously voted to decertify the commissioners, but the commissioners appealed that decision, resulting in Wednesday’s hearing.
Commissioners Jamie Clemmer and Johnathan Williams supported decertifying Milam for four years in addition to issuing her a letter of reprimand, but the rest of the board rejected this proposal. The board agreed unanimously to give Milam solely a letter of reprimand.
On Wednesday, the board dismissed a complaint against Ellen Griffin, a Searcy County poll supervisor who was falsely accused of discouraging voters from using provisional ballots. Lancaster also served as Griffin’s legal counsel.
None of Lancaster’s sanctioned clients have decided to appeal the state board’s decisions as of Thursday morning, he said.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)When Colorado voters in 2018 adopted an independent commission to draw congressional maps, the commission was designed to reduce the partisanship that had previously dogged map-drawing responsibility when it rested with the state Legislature.
It was also a time when Americans had at least some confidence that leaders throughout the country shared fundamental values that, despite policy differences, ensured political regularity.
Things are different now.
Trumpist Republicans have adopted a form of extreme partisanship that rejects political opponents as illegitimate, and they treat voter preferences as irrelevant. They are openly hostile to the fundamental values that have undergirded the American project since its founding, and they have already trashed so many of the laws, norms and institutions that constituted the republic.
So as President Donald Trump and Republican leaders around the country brazenly prepare to redistrict states such as Texas to favor congressional Republicans, many Democrats say they have little choice but to counter this attack on democracy by redistricting states they lead. Majority control of the U.S. House is at stake.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The kind of gerrymandering Republicans are attempting violates the core democratic principle that voters should choose their leaders, not the other way around. That’s what the independent commission is all about. Many Democrats, like those in Colorado, have taken steps to reduce map-drawing practices that prioritize one political party. 
But if they let Republican-led states gerrymander with abandon and fail to respond, the partisan balance in the U.S. House will have no relation to the will of the voters.
Virtually every discussion on the matter so far concludes that mid-decade redistricting can’t be done in Colorado, even though both chambers of the state Legislature are dominated by Democrats and the governor is a Democrat. But crucial points omitted from the analysis so far suggest an opening for redistricting in the state.
A Colorado Supreme Court ruling from 2003 is commonly cited as the main reason Colorado can’t undertake redistricting mid-decade.
The Legislature failed to draw congressional maps after the 2000 census, and a state district court was forced to draw one for the 2002 elections. In 2003, Republicans took over majority control of both chambers of the General Assembly, and they drew new maps. Ken Salazar, then the Democratic attorney general, sued, and the Colorado Supreme Court threw out the Republican maps.
The majority on the court said the state constitution requires redistricting after the census and restricts the Legislature from redistricting at any other time. But a provision the justices relied on to make that ruling is the very one transformed by the 2018 amendment creating an independent redistricting commission. That amendment might have weakened the durability of the Colorado Supreme Court’s earlier ruling.










I am opposed to the cancer of gerrymandering, but I respect those who don't want to bring a knife to a gunfight.


– Kent Thiry, one of the main backers of Colorado's independent redistricting commission


Several U.S. Supreme Court justices at the time had their own doubts. The Colorado General Assembly had asked the high court to review the Colorado Supreme Court ruling, and though the majority of justices declined to do so, members of the high court’s conservative wing, including Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, saying the provision at issue in the state constitution might conflict with the U.S. Constitution.
Another important point is that the state constitution does not explicitly bar mid-decade redistricting or redistricting by an authority other than the independent commission.
In California, which also redistricts through an independent commission created by a state constitutional amendment, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democratic leaders are pursuing mid-decade redistricting in response to Texas’ plan to redistrict to favor Republicans. The specifics of California law are different from Colorado’s, but the thrust of an influential analysis from the UCLA Voting Rights Project on the redistricting plan might offer guidance to Colorado Democrats.
The analysis distinguishes between the independent commission’s “responsibility” to redistrict and the legislature’s “power” to redistrict. The legislature could exercise that power, derived from the U.S. Constitution, “today,” according to the authors.
It would normally dishonor the democratic traditions of Colorado to even engage in a conversation about partisan-motivated mid-decade redistricting. But the complete rejection of democratic norms and pursuit of win-at-all-costs politics by Republicans leave opponents with a stark choice — counterstrike or perish.
In a sign of the scale of the threat posed by the Trumpist right, even Kent Thiry, one of the main backers of Colorado’s independent commission, said he understands why Democrats would redistrict.
“I am opposed to the cancer of gerrymandering, but I respect those who don’t want to bring a knife to a gunfight,” he said in a post on social media.
The redistricting conversation in Colorado — represented in Congress by four Republicans and four Democrats, even though Democrats hold every statewide office and have strong majorities in the state House and Senate — commenced when a former Democratic member of Congress, Yadira Caraveo, who is running to reclaim her seat in the 8th Congressional District, called for the state to scrap its independent commission and redistrict.
“For the sake of the country, Democrats need to fight back,” she wrote in a press release.
The stakes are so high that the Legislature might decide to redistrict and prepare to withstand the inevitable lawsuits. Or redistricting proponents could put new maps to voters, as the California Legislature is planning to do in a special election. 
And there’s the less irregular method of putting on the 2026 ballot a constitutional amendment that at least would repeal the independent commission and allow for redistricting before the 2028 election — though Trump’s consolidation of authoritarian power by then could be entrenched beyond resistance.
The bad-faith scheme from Republicans to guarantee themselves a U.S. House majority is an affront to democracy and an existential challenge to opponents. Leaders in other states — such as Kansas and Minnesota, in addition to California — refuse to be steamrolled. Newsom in California put it this way: “If we don’t put a stake into the heart of this administration, there may not be an election in 2028 … They’re not screwing around. We can’t afford to screw around either. We have got to fight fire with fire.”

(Photo courtesy of Rob Sand's campaign) State Auditor Rob Sand, who is running as a Democratic candidate for governor, said Thursday he is still “learning” and “listening” to stakeholders to develop a plan toward what some have called a water quality crisis in Iowa. 
Sand spoke with reporters after a tour of Des Moines Water Works, and said he agrees that water quality issues have reached a crisis point in the state, and he wants to develop a “realistic and well informed and achievable” plan to address the issue. 
“People who are frustrated should be frustrated,” Sand said. “I’m frustrated. I want to be able to take my kids tubing when we’re home in Decorah in the Upper Iowa River, without having to hesitate. I want to be able to go to a beach no matter where we are in Iowa without … having to check to see if it’s safe for swimming.”
Water quality issues have been brought to the forefront this summer, especially in central Iowa, as Central Iowa Water Works issued its first ever lawn watering ban due to the high concentration of nitrates in source water rivers. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
CIWW, which serves more than 600,000 customers in the Des Moines region, announced Thursday the lawn watering ban, which began June 12, was officially lifted. The regional authority is asking for a voluntary watering reduction of 25% in the system. 
A two-year study from Polk County was also released this season that pointed to agriculture as the top contributor to the nitrate problems in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers. At a presentation of the report Monday, researchers and members of the public called for regulation on the agriculture sector to protect water quality. 
Sand said he has read the Central Iowa Source Water Resource Assessment report and that water-quality scientists are among the people he wants to hear from when creating his plan on the issue. He also wants to hear from family farmers who he said are “interested in” protecting soil and water but need more help from the state and federal governments. 
“I want to listen to everybody, and I want to be making sure that I’m trying to suss out where the truth lies in all these statements,” Sand said. 
Officials in Linn County announced plans Tuesday to undergo a comprehensive water quality plan and approved funding for three studies of the current conditions. 
Sand said he does not have any “predeterminations” on what the best solution to water pollution issue would be, though he said he has not ruled out the idea of regulations. 
“What I’m looking for from stakeholders are a sense of fairness, a sense of obligation and interest in solving the problem, a sense of acknowledging the magnitude of the problem, and, you know, some practical steps towards actually getting things done,” Sand said. 
Sand said critics of his campaign who say he is partial to big ag interests because of campaign contributions from his in-laws have an “emotional” rather than a factual reaction.
Sand has received large campaign contributions in the past from his wife and in-laws who run the Lauridsen Group, which makes things like pet food, supplements and dairy ingredients. 
The contributions from his family members have been frequently mentioned by Iowa GOP members.
Sand said his in-laws are politically frustrated and see him as a “someone that’s actually interested in trying to get things done right.” 
Sand said if he doesn’t have a plan to address water quality issues come fall of next year, people would have a “right to be frustrated” with him. 
“But that’s not going to happen,” Sand said. “We’re putting together a plan, we’re taking time to learn.”

California has cut back on rooftop solar incentives as the state has an estimated 47 gigawatts of solar power installed, nearly 25 percent of the state's electricity, that powers 13.9 million homes. On days where there is little demand for electricity, the price of electricity flattens and gigawatts of the solar generated power is curtailed. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.
As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.
“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”
Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.
“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.
The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.













 We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it. 


–  – Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce


“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”
But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.
“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”
 Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.
State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.
Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”
While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.
“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.
 A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.
“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.
Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.
“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”
Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.
“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.
Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.
“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”
Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.
“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

There’s the one where the Lenexa City Council member has to “assimilate and perform” like her white counterparts, she said. Then there’s the authentic world, where she is aware of how vulnerable she is in this country, “simply because I’m brown and because I have an accent.”
“It feels lonely,” she said.
At Tuesday night’s city council meeting, which was packed with residents who were upset about last week’s raid by federal authorities at El Toro Loco restaurants in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas, Arroyo revealed that city police had recently investigated her citizenship status and required her to prove her citizenship.
It started with someone complaining to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation about testimony Arroyo submitted in February to a state Senate committee in opposition to a bill that would eliminate in-state tuition for immigrants. The individual — whom the KBI declined to identify — questioned whether Arroyo was a U.S. citizen and eligible to hold public office.
The KBI referred the complaint to Lenexa police, who questioned Arroyo. She hired an attorney and presented documentation from her 2018 naturalization. Police closed the case last week, two days before the El Toro Loco raids.
For Arroyo, the police inquiry was a painful reminder that a single disgruntled resident can disrupt her life by making a false allegation.
Arroyo told Kansas Reflector she decided to talk about her experience after the unrelated federal raid in Lenexa, which raised questions about whether agents had violated the rights of workers who were detained without regard for whether they had committed a crime, had a lawful immigration status, or were U.S. citizens.
Arroyo said the two situations were connected only by the underlying motive, “which is xenophobia.”
“I felt like I had this obligation to come forward with my story, to let people know in Kansas City that everybody needs to wake the f*** up,” Arroyo said. “You guys are still living in 2024, thinking that our judicial processes are intact, and they’re not. I’m living in the summer of 2025, being directly impacted by this, and so we need to adapt to the circumstances that we’re in. And I don’t know what that looks like. I don’t know what the solutions are.”
Those who attended Tuesday night’s council meeting gasped when Arroyo revealed the police inquiry. They responded to her remarks with a standing ovation that lasted 20 seconds before Mayor Julie Sayers restored order with her gavel.
Councilwoman Courtney Eiterich expressed solidarity with Arroyo. Eiterich said her husband is an immigrant and that they have had conversations about whether he needs to keep naturalization papers with him.
In Lenexa and across the country, Eiterich said, authorities carrying out President Donald Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportations are violating constitutional rights with the support of federal courts.
“I teach high school government, and this is really difficult for me to wrap my head around and try to explain to my students how this is happening and what is our role in trying to fix it. And I don’t have any answers,” Eiterich said.

No evidence for inquiry
Lenexa city attorney Sean McLaughlin defended the police investigation of Arroyo.
He said Arroyo’s testimony before the Legislature indicated she had overstayed her visa and didn’t acknowledge her naturalization. He pointed to a city ordinance that requires office holders to be citizens.
“We felt we had no choice but to investigate the matter because it is the city’s obligation to ensure compliance with our own ordinances,” McLaughlin told the council.
“We stand behind our actions,” he added.
Arroyo submitted written testimony in opposition to Senate Bill 254, which was supported by Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach. A Senate committee held a contentious hearing on the proposal in February and advanced the bill in March, but the full Senate never gave it consideration.
The testimony describes her experience growing up as “an undocumented immigrant girl” in the Kansas City area who didn’t speak fluent English. She said she was able to enroll in Kansas universities “with the condition that I resolved my immigration status.” She studied studio art and psychology at the University of Saint Mary and Johnson County Community College, then earned master’s degrees in clinical counseling and art therapy at Emporia State University.
Melissa Underwood, a spokeswoman for the KBI, said a Johnson County resident referenced Arroyo’s testimony in a voicemail left at the agency’s Lenexa office. The KBI referred the matter to city police, Underwood said, because the state agency typically doesn’t investigate immigration-related matters. Underwood said the complaint didn’t come from Kobach.
“The information was sent to the Lenexa Police Department for follow-up as they deemed appropriate,” Underwood said.
In a brief interview after the city council meeting, McLaughlin acknowledged there was no evidence to support a complaint about Arroyo’s citizenship status.
But, he said, “just because evidence doesn’t exist doesn’t mean we don’t investigate.”

Public outcry
Two dozen community members voiced concerns to the council about the investigation of Arroyo and the raid on a local restaurant.
They included Kansas Rep. Susan Ruiz, LGBTQ+ activist Jae Moyer, immigration attorney Anne Parelkar, two pastors, and Roeland Park City Council member Jen Hill, who was Arroyo’s 8th grade English teacher in 2005.
Even then, Hill said, Arroyo’s “voice carried strength, clarity and purpose.”
“It’s because I know her so well that I’m both saddened and outraged by the recent false allegations questioning her citizenship,” Hill said. “These claims are not only entirely unfounded, they are a blatant attempt to discredit her based on her ethnicity, rather than recognizing the immense value of her service and her character.”
Sara Rohleder told the council this was the first local government meeting she had ever attended, and “that’s saying a lot.” She referenced the approximately 150 people who attended the meeting and pointed out that many of them were in the 18-25 age range.
“I’m very concerned,” Rohleder  said. “I don’t know what future I have. I don’t know what future my cousins have, who are younger than me. I think this sets a very dangerous precedent. I think this is very, very serious, and I really strongly feel — I honestly feel comfort in knowing that it’s not just me who’s feeling this, because it’s a very isolating time. Look at all these people. Everyone’s here because they care about what’s going on.”
Muñeca Nieves described herself as a proud Afro-Caribbean woman who works for the federal government. She said she had lost 40 pounds by walking to work every day, but “I don’t do it anymore, because I’m brown.”
“Every time a black SUV comes by, I get scared,” Nieves said.
She also said she was “extremely disappointed” in the Lenexa city attorney’s insistence that police were just “following the rules” when they investigated Arroyo.
“Those rules equate to racial profiling,” Nieves said, “which is against the law.”

Police chief responds
Lenexa Police Chief Dawn Layman addressed the council at the end of the meeting and acknowledged the hurt expressed by Arroyo.
“I apologize if I made you feel that way,” Layman told her.
Layman said Homeland Security Investigations notified her a week in advance that they would execute a criminal search warrants, authorized by a federal judge, at the El Toro Loco in Lenexa. They mutually agreed that Lenexa police officers would not be on site, she said.
She said the federal raids were related to an ongoing investigation into labor exploitation.
Layman said her department is focused on public safety and serving all who live, work and visit Lenexa, regardless of immigration status.
“Our responsibility is to protect the public, uphold the law, maintain public order and serve our community with honor, integrity and professionalism, and that is in regardless of our personal beliefs or opinion,” Layman said.
In an interview, Arroyo said Layman was unaware of the political and historical weight of asking someone for their papers. But Arroyo also stressed that she doesn’t think Lenexa police are the problem.
“My concern is that we are not aware of the times that we’re living in,” Arroyo said, “and we’re failing to meet the moment.”

Trump’s rollback of federal incentives for renewable energy, according to a consultant for the project.
Applications for the proposed 325-megawatt facility in Killingly were withdrawn in June by the Israel-based developer, Sunflower Sustainable Investments. At the time, representatives for the company said little about their rationale for the move, which came less than a year after the project was submitted to the Connecticut Siting Council for approval.
But Jonathan Milley, a consultant and spokesman for the project, said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror this week that capital costs were projected to increase between 30% and 50% due to tariffs and recent changes in federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects. Those issues, combined with a rocky outlook for offshore wind and more general economic uncertainty, all contributed to the project’s demise, he said.
“It became entirely untenable,” Milley said. “It was just was much, much too risky to warrant going forward with the investment.”
The Killingly project — also known as the Windham Energy Center — had an estimated budget of $200 million and would have taken a little more than a year to build. The plans called for a series of large batteries housed in dozens of prefabricated storage containers, as well as an electrical substation connecting to nearby transmission lines. 
Construction of the project would have employed up to 40 people at a time, in overlapping crews, according to documents submitted to the siting council.
Milley explained that the Killingly project was planned as a so-called “merchant” storage facility, meaning it would purchase electricity off the grid at times when renewables such as solar and wind were supplying lots of low-cost power. That electricity could then be stored and sold back onto the grid at other times, such as in the evening, when demand is higher but renewables are not operating at their peak.
In particular, Milley said the project’s developers were hoping to tap into an abundance of wind power produced by several planned turbine farms off the Atlantic Coast. 
But because merchant projects operate without long-term power purchase agreements with utilities or other customers, Milley said they also carry more risk for investors. A recent downturn in the offshore wind industry that was exacerbated by the Trump administration’s opposition to wind power made the battery project even harder to pull off, he said.
The location of the proposed battery facility — on a property that had previously been slated for construction of a natural-gas-fired power plant — also added to the list of difficulties facing the developers.
The company behind the failed gas plant proposal, NTE Energy, still held a certificate of approval from the siting council to develop the property. Therefore, attorneys for Sunflower Sustainable Investments, the battery developers, had to file a separate request for the council to reopen that approval process for the purpose of resolving the issue.
Milley said that attorneys for the project initially believed the issue with the certificate would be quickly resolved, but it ended up delaying the project while the outside political and economic landscape worsened. 
“This is a compendium of foreign investors looking at the situation, going around and saying, ‘You know what? This is way too much uncertainty,'” Milley said. “Any one of these things is difficult. We could have analyzed any one of them in isolation… but the compendium of everything was just too much.” 
In addition to the Killingly project, Milley said that Sunflower Sustainable Investments had recently decided to terminate similar battery projects under development in Texas and South Carolina. 
Ken Gillingham, an energy and environmental economist at Yale University, said that Milley’s explanation of the company’s decisions made sense given the wider challenges facing the industry under the Trump administration.
“It’s become impossible to plan right now in the renewables and battery space,” Gillingham said.
In April, Trump announced tariffs of up to 125% on Chinese goods as part of a back-and-forth series of trade threats between the two counties. While those duties were later pared back to around 30%, the Trump administration has proposed additional tariffs on specific components that go into the production of batteries, namely graphite and copper, that could significantly impact their cost. All of those tariffs remain subject to ongoing talks between the U.S. and China, and the Trump administration is expected to extend its current Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a deal, according to the Associated Press. 
China dominates the market for utility-scale batteries, currently producing upwards of 80% of the world’s cells, according to Bloomberg. Other major producers include Japan and South Korea, both of which have been slapped with additional tariffs by the Trump administration.
In addition to tariffs, President Trump last month signed Congressional Republicans’ tax and spending bill that included a rollback of many existing tax credits for renewable energy projects. Those changes have roiled plans by other developers to install new, carbon-free sources of power. 
“For projects that are already under construction, or just about under construction and fully permitted, they’re still moving forward right now,” Gillingham said. “But it’s that next tranche of projects, and [Killingly] was in that category, it’s pretty clear that there’s a lot of uncertainty.”
While the bill left in place tax credits for battery projects, Gillingham said that lawmakers included new requirements on applicants to source more of their materials from the United States. Depending on how strictly the federal government enforces those requirements, Gilligham said they have the potential to significantly increase the cost of future projects. 
In documents submitted to the Connecticut Siting Council, the developers for Killingly facility said they planned to use batteries produced by CATL, a Chinese company whose production is almost entirely located overseas. 
CATL is known for its production of lithium iron phosphate batteries, a technology that it marketed as safer alternative to more traditional lithium-ion batteries that can erupt into intense fires caused by thermal runaway. The risk of fire was one of several concerns raised by town officials in their initial response to the developer’s application with the siting council.
However, those concerns had not formed into formal opposition to the project from the town before the developers pulled their application, according to correspondence submitted to the siting council.
Killingly’s economic development director, Jill St. Clair, said in an email last month that the only explanation the developers gave to town officials was that the project was canceled due to “changing market conditions.” St. Clair did not respond to additional requests for comment this week.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, along with a bipartisan coalition of 49 other attorneys general, requested that the U.S. Department of Justice assist in their efforts to address what they described as a “rampant spread of illegal offshore gaming operations” across the country.
In a letter addressed to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Drummond, Utah Attorney General Derek Brown and his counterparts said that illegal online sports betting and gaming operations, widely run by foreign-based companies, could be harming residents in all 50 states, since they “routinely operate without proper licensure, offer limited or non-existent consumer protections, fail to verify user age, ignore state boundaries, and evade taxation obligations.”
The volume of illegal online gaming has exceeded $400 billion a year, the National Association of Attorneys General estimates — and over $4 billion in lost tax revenue for states.
“Since 2013, USDOJ enforcement actions against illegal offshore gambling sites have been extremely limited,” the attorneys wrote. “We seek USDOJ’s cooperation and coordination to deploy robust legal tools to curb these unlawful enterprises.”
The Department of Justice is allowed to seize assets like servers, domains and proceeds that violate federal law, the letter says, an authority the department has used in at least two other fraud cases.
Additionally, the attorneys suggested the department work with major payment processors to cut off the companies’ access to the U.S. financial system.
“Both Visa and Mastercard have already signaled their willingness to investigate and address unlawful use of their networks for gambling transactions,” the letter says. “We should capitalize on this willingness to shut down illegal offshore gaming operations.”
The activity exposes vulnerable people to fraud and addictive gambling without oversight or accountability, the attorneys wrote, and has been linked to other serious crimes.
“Illegal offshore gaming operations are a breeding ground for criminal behavior, such as money laundering and human trafficking. These companies routinely flaunt Utah laws and put Utah consumers at risk,” Brown said in a statement. “Together we can take action against these foreign-based operations that wreak havoc on our communities, foster gambling addictions, and harm Utah consumers.”

Since 1904, The Pinedale Roundup has broken a lot of news in the western Wyoming community. But on Wednesday morning, the Roundup published what stands to be the paper’s last scoop: the publication’s immediate closure.


Managing Editor Cali O’Hare posted the “final piece of news” on the paper’s Facebook page, shortly after being instructed to cancel The Pinedale Roundup’s Aug. 7 edition, which was on the verge of being printed.
“Our hearts are broken for our colleagues and our communities,” O’Hare wrote.

The Roundup was among a couple dozen newspapers across five states that were abruptly shuttered on Wednesday, as its Illinois-based parent company, News Media Corporation, announced it was ceasing operations. Eight Wyoming newspapers and a Nebraska-based publication that operated under the corporation’s Wyoming Newspapers Inc. subsidiary were among those closed, resulting in the layoffs of their 30 employees.
The corporation had owned the bulk of its Wyoming publications — the Uinta County Herald in Evanston, the Torrington Telegram, the Platte County Record Times in Wheatland, the Kemmerer Gazette, the Lusk Herald and the Bridger Valley Pioneer — for roughly two decades.
In a memo to staffers Wednesday, News Media Corporation CEO J.J. Tompkins said the company had explored “every possible avenue” to continue operating, but “reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible.”
Tompkins specifically cited “financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses,” plus the recent collapse of a plan to sell the company to the Alabama-based Carpenter Media Group.
But the immediate shuttering still came as a “shock” to Rob Mortimore, the president of Wyoming Newspapers Inc. He described his employees as “some of the greatest and hard working individuals I’ve ever met” and said the papers’ closures would leave a void in their communities.

Mortimore couldn’t speak to the company’s publications outside the state. But after cutting newsrooms and personnel in recent years, he said the Wyoming papers were making money.
“Without a doubt, they’re profitable,” Mortimore said, and he’s holding out hope that someone will purchase the publications.
“It’s a great opportunity for someone to come in and take these … and continue to give our communities the news that they deserve and need,” he said.
In the meantime, eight communities and tens of thousands of Wyoming residents are without publications that they’ve relied on for a century or more.
Gov. Mark Gordon called the abrupt closure of the papers “devastating, both to the residents of these Wyoming communities and to the employees whose hard work ensured they were well-informed on local issues.”
“The loss of these publications — which covered local government, schools and their sports teams, and community events — leaves a void that will not be easy to replace,” Gordon said in a statement.
  A series of cutbacks 

O’Hare first saw signs of trouble in 2023, when News Media Corporation moved to have The Roundup absorb the Sublette Examiner. What followed was a series of cuts that effectively left her as a one-woman newspaper, even as subscribers increased and advertising revenue solidified, O’Hare said.
After the two papers combined in July 2023, people still called trying to place ads in the Sublette Examiner.
“I think our community has really shown how much they care about the newspaper and us as reporters,” O’Hare said.
O’Hare and community members lobbied hard to keep Sublette Examiner and Pinedale Roundup reporter Joy Ufford on staff and succeeded for about six months, O’Hare said. When news broke that Ufford had been laid off in February 2024, “within an hour I had a gentleman in here who offered to pay for her salary,” O’Hare said.
“They know we need a newspaper of record here, or some legitimate news source,” she said.
The eight papers most recently reported having 9,751 paid subscribers to their print or digital offerings, according to a WyoFile calculation. While significantly down from historical figures, that’s roughly 22% higher than 2024’s circulation numbers.
On Wednesday morning, O’Hare was running around the office, packing up as quickly as possible, including boxing up plaques of awards won by the Roundup and preparing to return trophies to the Wyoming Press Association. She’d come down with a fever Friday and was just starting to feel better.
“I was already sick so it’s a fun time to lose my health insurance,” said O’Hare, who earned an annual wage of $38,000 and described having to get permission for expenses like purchasing toilet paper.
  ‘Nobody saw it coming’ 

At the Uinta County Herald in Evanston, Sports Editor Don Cogger also recalled a series of cuts. When he started with the paper in 2019, Cogger covered Evanston sports, but as staff dwindled, he was asked to add in Lyman, Mountain View and Kemmerer coverage to his beat for publication in sister papers.
When the doors shut on Wednesday, The Kemmerer Gazette was solely staffed by an office manager, Cogger said, while the Bridger Valley Pioneer effectively had no staff; its editor was let go in the spring.
The Evanston newspaper’s advertising manager, Brian Liechty, was tasked with notifying staff and shutting down the corporation’s offices in the southwestern part of the state. Liechty had been with the Herald for nearly 27 years.
“People are just stunned, you know,” Cogger said Wednesday. “Nobody saw it coming.”
The Herald, the Pioneer and the Gazette were all printed in Torrington. As a side gig, Cogger helped shuttle the copies to Uinta County. He wound up picking up the final editions of the three papers in Rock Springs on Tuesday, ahead of their Wednesday delivery to readers. The papers contained no news of their closures.
“We all deserved better than this, and we wish we could have said a proper goodbye,” O’Hare wrote on The Pinedale Roundup’s Facebook page and the paper’s website.
Cogger wished that the corporation had at least allowed some time for its staffers to wrap up their work. He had to scrap interviews he had lined up for upcoming stories and texted coaches to say he wouldn’t be covering their upcoming fall seasons.
More prominent sports like football, basketball and volleyball get broader coverage, including from the local radio station, but many of the other sports “just rely primarily on the newspaper to get any kind of coverage,” Cogger said. “So they’re gonna lose all that.”
Even among those who might not have had the best opinion of the Herald, “I think they’ll eventually miss it as well,” Cogger said. “I think people don’t understand how much they’re gonna miss it once it’s gone.”
  ‘Still a great business to be in’ 

In his letter to employees, News Media Corporation CEO Tompkins alluded to company debt.
“We will make all reasonable efforts to pay you all remaining compensation you have earned as soon as possible,” he wrote, “to the extent permitted by the company’s secured lenders.”
  he Pinedale Roundup’s Managing Editor Cali O’Hare packed up her belongings on Aug. 6 after the News Media Corporation announced the immediate closure of the 120-year-old paper of record. (Cali O’Hare/The Pinedale Roundup)
Tompkins didn’t respond by deadline to an email asking in part why the company closed so abruptly and whether the company was still open to a sale.
John Cribb of the newspaper and publication brokerage Cribb & Associates in Helena, Montana, said small community newspapers “are still a great business to be in.”
They can be built into very successful local businesses, Cribb said, but “it’s harder and harder to find the individuals that really have the skill set, the time, and a little bit of money to make it work.”
In general, he said it’s been a “buyer’s market” for papers since the Great Recession of 2007-2008.
Unlike past decades, when newspaper mergers and acquisitions waxed and waned in seven-year cycles, “there’s been no catalyst to kind of flip it back to being a seller’s market,” Cribb said. “Revenue continues to go down, and there’s no incentive for buyers.”
He added that shuttering a publication — as News Media Corporation did Wednesday — poses another challenge.
“If they cease publication, it makes it really, really hard to start it back up,” Cribb said, adding, “what do you do with your advertisers? What do you do with all of your subscribers?”
Sorting that out, “can get really messy very, very quickly,” he said.
The shuttered papers served as official papers of record for local governments, which are mandated by state law to publish things like their meeting minutes, election proclamations and salaries in local newspapers. Those “legal notices” are intended to keep the public informed and serve as a significant source of revenue for Wyoming papers.
The sudden shuttering of News Media Corporation’s publications presents not only a challenge for local governments, but in the wider view, “a big problem for the rest of the newspapers in the state when it comes to the state Legislature and what to do with legal advertising,” Cribb said.
Wyoming lawmakers have periodically discussed the idea of scrapping or phasing out the state’s papers’ de facto monopoly on publishing legal notices. So far, those efforts have stalled out.
  The end of the line 

In a Wednesday statement, leaders of the newspaper industry’s trade group, the Wyoming Press Association, described themselves as “disheartened” by the papers’ sudden closures.
“The loss of these newspapers is already shocking loyal readers and advertisers, and the impacts of these closures will undoubtedly have a ripple effect,” the association’s board of directors wrote, with impacts already felt by “tens of thousands of Wyomingites, and dozens of loyal employees.”
The press association added that News Media Corporation’s actions “are not indicative of the state of newspapers in Wyoming.”
“There are still dozens of newspapers who are fierce advocates for their communities, whether through reporting on local high school sports or holding their local governments accountable,” the statement said.
The Lusk Herald was the longest-running publication in Wyoming, established four years before the territory’s statehood, in 1886. The Torrington Telegram, meanwhile, is ending a 122-year run. The closure of such long-running publications “is heartbreaking,” said Mortimore, the publisher of the company’s Wyoming publications.






“We become, you know, part of the community, and people rely on us and count on us, and they’re accustomed to us being there,” he said. “So it’s going to be very hard to take in and comprehend what it means for those people in our community.”






Throughout the day, Mortimore heard from readers and advertisers, who shared messages that were, overwhelmingly, positive. In some ways, he said, that made it all the harder to swallow. A native and current resident of Torrington, Mortimore said he’d gotten choked up reading some of the well wishes from people he knows.
Torrington’s Little League baseball team is currently representing Wyoming at the Mountain Region tournament in San Bernardino, California, and the Telegram has been covering their success.
“It’s been a very good week here, as far as being able to share the stories of what they’re doing, and the community really getting behind it,” said Mortimore, who previously coached the youth, “and now we just … there’s nothing.”
He predicted that, in the absence of the Telegram, the community would continue to share those stories in other ways. But it won’t be the same.
Radio stations offer coverage in some of the impacted communities, like Wheatland and Torrington, but not places like Lusk and Guernsey, Mortimore said.
“There is really no other option,” he said, adding, “It was basically the newspapers in these communities. So that’s the hardest pill to swallow.”
  ‘We rely on our local paper’ 

Lynette Saucedo of Torrington described the closures as devastating not only for her community but the entire state.
“In these small, rural communities, we rely on our local paper,” Saucedo said. “There’s definitely a population in our community that, that is their news.”
One of the Torrington Telegram’s final stories was about “Pickles the Rock Snake,” a new community art project that Saucedo helped coordinate in her role as the director of an afterschool program. The artwork was installed outside the Torrington Police Department, and was aimed at forging positive relationships between officers and local youth, the Telegram reported.
Over the years, Saucedo said she and the police department have also used the paper to share information about the warning signs for suicide and to remind youth about staying safe at events like homecoming and prom.
In the absence of the Telegram, that sharing is “going to be difficult,” she said. “We do have social media platforms, but that’s not the same thing.”
Without reporters building relationships in the community and telling local stories, “you just start to lose that community connection,” she said.
Saucedo, 58, has lived in Torrington her entire life and “the Telegram has never not been here,” she said, adding, “not having it is going to be quite a loss.”

Set to rise near Omaha South High School, the 36,000-square-foot facility is planned to fit 300 girls — up from about 50 served currently on a daily basis at the existing club site several blocks southwest.

While retaining the “Emma Lozier Center” name,  the replacement structure will include a full-sized gym, kitchen and cafeteria, multisports fields, flexible indoor and outdoor classrooms for STEM and art classes.
Overall, the campus is to reflect the culture and people of South Omaha, said Candias Jones, chief executive of Girls Inc. She said bilingual staff will be recruited, and her team will seek programming and other ideas from families of the area.
“This is a much-needed leap forward, one that increases our capacity, enhances safety and creates an environment that inspires even more girls than we’ve been able to reach before,” Jones said. “It’s a long-term commitment to the girls of South Omaha and the strength of our community.”
 
 Naming the building

	Emma Lozier was the mother of longtime Girls Inc. supporter Allan Lozier, whose interest in helping women and girls was inspired in part by his mother Emma and sister Mary Traudt. Emma was an active partner in the Lozier Corp. from its beginning in 1937. “She was a very strong woman, who probably was the impetus for most of the success the family had,” Allan Lozier once said.


 Celebrating 50 years

Jones and other leaders of Girls Inc. unveiled details and renderings of the planned South Omaha site during a luncheon Thursday. The event also marked 50 years since the entity opened as “Girls Club” with six girls in the basement of a North Omaha church.
The organization has evolved since 1975, and the Girls Inc. mothership today is in North Omaha, the Katherine Fletcher Center. Jones said the larger South Omaha site will be able to offer a similar scope of services and opportunities as the Fletcher campus.
She said the existing South Omaha center, in a renovated structure amid the soon-to-be-demolished Southside Terrace Homes public housing apartments, served the community well. But demand outgrew the space. 
Like the North Omaha center, the new South center will have a dedicated fleet of vans for after-school and field trip transportation. An annual cost of $100 allows a girl aged 5-18 to participate in year round leadership development and other programming, including meals and a full-day schedule in the summer.
Construction is to begin October at the site bounded generally by K, L, 20th and 21st Streets. Completion is projected in 2027. The designer is Omaha-based Holland Basham Architects. Kiewit Building Group was selected through a competitive bidding process to build the facility.

Girls Inc. has secured about 90% of the project’s cost, estimated at between $33 million and $35 million, with the bulk coming from philanthropy foundations including Sherwood, Lozier, Peter Kiewit, William & Ruth Scott, Rebecca Susan Buffett and Weitz Family.
 North and South Omaha grants

The $11.2 million in state funds comes from the North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. Girls Inc. was part of a handful of nonprofits that applied as the Q Street Corridor Economic Recovery Partnership group led by Canopy South.
The North-South grants were the key part of a broader economic development package hatched in 2022, approved by the Nebraska Legislature and Gov. Jim Pillen in 2023, which was aimed at spurring jobs and reinvestment in some of the most disenfranchised neighborhoods in Nebraska.
The funding source for the North-South initiative started with deadline-strapped COVID-19 federal dollars, but a swap with state dollars later occurred to allow more time for a complex slate of projects to develop. 
Sharing the $235 million in North and South Omaha recovery grants were about 130 groups and businesses, whose selection by state officials were based on potential for helping to reverse disinvestment. 
In January 2024, when individual awards were announced, the DED director said he expected 9,250 new jobs in North and South Omaha over the next five years as a result of the projects.
The grantees came from an original 365 or so applications submitted in the early stages that represented about $3 billion in requests.
“Lasting neighborhood change happens when we invest in the people and places that anchor our community,” said Canopy South’s César García. “Girls Inc. has been a pillar for South Omaha’s youth and families for generations. Supporting their growth is not just an investment in a building —   it’s an investment in the future of our neighborhood.”

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)INDIANAPOLIS — Vice President JD Vance spent several hours in the Hoosier State Thursday to meet with Gov. Mike Braun and other leaders about the possibility of creating more GOP seats with redrawn congressional boundaries.
The visit came amid a tussle in Republican-held Texas over new maps — and threats from Democrat-run states to retaliate.
Braun told reporters the Statehouse meeting went “pretty good” and that “we covered a wide array of topics.” He confirmed that at least part of the discussion was about redistricting, specifically.
When asked if state and federal officials came to any agreement, the governor said only that “we listened.”
House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate Pro Tem Rodric Bray, both Republicans, were also present, but neither answered questions after the meeting.
Instead, each released a brief written statement.
Huston said he appreciated the chance to meet with Vance and “share many of the successes we’re experiencing in Indiana.” He added that the group “had a meaningful discussion” and would continue conversations with the Trump administration.
State lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census, as per the Indiana Constitution. They last did so in 2021. Congressional Republicans have a 7-2 advantage.

It was great to meet with @VP Vance today. We discussed a number of issues, and I was pleased to highlight some of the great things happening in Indiana.
— Governor Mike Braun (@GovBraun) August 7, 2025

Bray called the visit “an honor” and described the meeting as “productive,” noting that several topics important to Indiana were discussed.
“I appreciated the opportunity to hear from the Vice President on a variety of issues, which we will continue to talk through in the days ahead,” Bray said.
A move in Indiana would likely focus on the First District in northwest Indiana, which is held by U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, a Democrat.
The governor would need to call a special session to move forward with any mid-cycle redistricting.
During the visit, several hundred Hoosiers, many of them angry and cursing, rallied at the Indiana Statehouse to protest against the proposal.
Julia Vaughn, the executive director of Common Cause Indiana, vowed to challenge any maps that came from a special session.
“We will see you in court, Gov. Braun,” said Vaughn, whose organization was heavily involved in the last redistricting session in 2021. She called on the crowd to return to the statehouse tenfold if a special session was called, noting that her organization gave Indiana’s maps a ‘D’ grade.
“… Leave our congressional maps alone!”
  Pushback at the statehouse 

Vance arrived at the Indiana Statehouse shortly before 10:30 a.m. and spent just shy of an hour in Braun’s office.
After the meeting — and before heading back to the nation’s capital — the vice president headlined a national Republican fundraising event held just blocks away in downtown Indianapolis.
All the while, those opposed to redistricting staged an hours-long sit-in at the statehouse.

“This is clearly a power grab,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis. “This is simply an attempt by the President to stay in power forever.”
Redistricting efforts in Texas, where President Donald Trump said Republicans were “entitled” to more seats, have stalled after Democrats fled the state.
With razor-thin margins in the U.S. House of Representatives, netting more GOP-controlled seats in the 2026 midterm would protect Trump’s priorities in the second half of his term.


Republicans control seven out of Indiana’s nine seats in the U.S. House. Democrats hold seats in Indianapolis and in the northwestern part of the state.
In order to redistrict, Republicans would have to call a special session – which comes at a cost. A two-week special session in 2022 cost $240,000.
One of Mrvan’s constituents, Jillian Schranz, came from northwestern Indiana Thursday to protest against the proposed redistricting.
“I think gerrymandering is not new. Democrats do it; Republicans do it,” Schranz said. “But the fact that we’re talking about a special session and not waiting for census data is really alarming.”
She said she’d heard about ongoing budget concerns directly from her General Assembly lawmakers, Sen. Dan Dernulc and Rep. Hal Slager. She emailed both Republican men to ask for their perspective on redistricting.
“It would be hypocritical for Indiana Republicans to call the special session,” Schranz concluded.

Beth McClellan, from the north side of Indianapolis, arrived at the state capitol building shortly before 9 a.m. and said she’s also concerned about a possible re-draw of Indiana’s 5th District, which has become increasingly competitive after years of Republican dominance.
“The idea of redrawing our districts … it’s ludicrous, it’s bad optics and it’s a bad idea,” she said. “We’re a red state — already with Republican dominated seats here and in Washington. … Our elected officials should be focused on issues, not playing around with maps.”

 Will redistricting happen?

Pete Seat, a longtime Indiana Republican strategist and national political commentator, said he senses a lot of hesitancy among GOP leaders in Indiana.
He noted there is an “element of Hoosier hospitality involved and an open ear, but maybe not an open mind.”
Seat said with Republican supermajorities controlling both the House and Senate it would not be a heavy lift. But it would go against two decades of messaging that Indiana handles its map-drawing process the right way.
“We take a lot of pride in our map and how we draw our districts and the thought put behind it and maintaining communities of interest and respecting existing boundaries,” he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “Do you really want to go back on that?”
The former White House spokesman said he doesn’t know if there is compelling data pointing to the need for a mid-decade redistricting.
“But I mean, look, we live in a transparent political environment with Donald Trump at the helm, and I think the rationale would be naked politics,” he said. “Not a lot of people hide from that these days, ‘yeah we want more seats to be in the U.S. House of Representatives.’ So what?”
Seat doesn’t think there would be a political cost to Indiana Republicans related to backlash against them for drawing maps early. But he noted there could be a cost based on how the new boundaries line up.
“There’s going to be some lines that shift. How does that impact the incumbents or future candidates in those newly drawn districts? There’s a ripple effect,” he said.
Seat discounted the cost of a special session as being a factor in any decision.
“If this is something you feel needs to be done, the cost of it is relative peanuts to other other issues,” he said. “I don’t think that’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back.”

Clellan is the first woman and openly LGBTQ person to lead the Colorado National Guard.
The state listed the job posting for Clellan’s replacement on Thursday, with an annual salary of about $230,000. Polis is in charge of appointing the cabinet-level position.
“Through wildfires and floods, a pandemic and unprecedented times, General Clellan led the Colorado National Guard with dignity, supporting Coloradans and our communities through turbulent times,” Polis said in a statement.
During her military career, Clellan was deployed five times overseas and was awarded a Bronze Star Medal. She joined the Colorado National Guard in 1998. In 2023, the U.S. Senate promoted her to the rank of Major General.
The Colorado National Guard comprises part-time citizen soldiers and airmen who mostly respond to natural disasters and other emergencies. Most recently, Polis mobilized the force to help respond to the Elk and Lee fires near Meeker.

(Photo by Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring those with account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
Bill would add protections for children used as content by social media influencers

The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
40 million subscribers
Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Social media experts are skeptical about the power of new state laws

Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
States step in
In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”










In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections.


– Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich


This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
For family bloggers, kids make money. A Utah lawmaker wants to make sure they’re compensated, too

Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.

In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

In a letter addressed to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Brown and his counterparts said that illegal online sports betting and gaming operations, widely run by foreign-based companies, could be harming residents in all 50 states, since they “routinely operate without proper licensure, offer limited or non-existent consumer protections, fail to verify user age, ignore state boundaries, and evade taxation obligations.”
The volume of illegal online gaming has exceeded $400 billion a year, the National Association of Attorneys General estimates — and over $4 billion in lost tax revenue for states.
“Since 2013, USDOJ enforcement actions against illegal offshore gambling sites have been extremely limited,” the attorneys wrote. “We seek USDOJ’s cooperation and coordination to deploy robust legal tools to curb these unlawful enterprises.”
The Department of Justice is allowed to seize assets like servers, domains and proceeds that violate federal law, the letter says, an authority the department has used in at least two other fraud cases.
Additionally, the attorneys suggested the department work with major payment processors to cut off the companies’ access to the U.S. financial system.
“Both Visa and Mastercard have already signaled their willingness to investigate and address unlawful use of their networks for gambling transactions,” the letter says. “We should capitalize on this willingness to shut down illegal offshore gaming operations.”
The activity exposes vulnerable people to fraud and addictive gambling without oversight or accountability, the attorneys wrote, and has been linked to other serious crimes.
“Illegal offshore gaming operations are a breeding ground for criminal behavior, such as money laundering and human trafficking. These companies routinely flaunt Utah laws and put Utah consumers at risk,” Brown said in a statement. “Together we can take action against these foreign-based operations that wreak havoc on our communities, foster gambling addictions, and harm Utah consumers.”

(Photo courtesy of New Haven Independent)Connecticut’s U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal traveled to Plymouth, Massachusetts, on Wednesday to visit an Afghan man, known as “Zia S.”, who is being held in detention there by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Zia S., whose full name is not being used due to concerns about his safety, came to the U.S. through a preapproved process called humanitarian parole. He had served as an interpreter for U.S. Armed Forces in his native Afghanistan.
Zia S. was detained despite, Blumenthal said, “following every single rule, he was doing everything right, including serving this country at great risk to himself and his family.”
On July 16, Zia S. was picked up by masked ICE agents after a standard appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in East Hartford. In the aftermath, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement that Zia S. was “under investigation for a serious allegation.”
Since then, a judge has barred the government from deporting Zia S. for the time being. Prosecutors have also said in a court filing that Zia S. is a risk to U.S. national security. 
After the visit Wednesday, Blumenthal decried the detention to members of the press, and said that Zia S. was only picked up because ICE has to “make a quota.”
“That’s the only reason Zia is locked up away from his family, away from his job, away from his community, outrageously and tragically. It is cruel and it is stupid,” he said to reporters outside the facility.
In May, White House Advisor Stephen Miller told Fox News that the administration planned to make a minimum of 3,000 daily arrests, but the Trump Administration has since denied that such numerical quotas exist.
On Wednesday, Blumenthal was unequivocal in his support of Zia S. and told The Connecticut Mirror that he hasn’t seen anything to support the claim that he is a national security threat.
“There is no security threat. If there were a security threat, they would have offered to tell me,” Blumenthal said.
Blumenthal said he planned to demand any such information be shown to him: “I’m going to do it as a senator who has a top secret clearance and the need to know. But I’ve listened to him and his story, and if they have some security threat, it’s totally fabricated.”
Blumenthal had the chance Wednesday to tour the Plymouth County Correctional Facility where ICE detainees are held, which he described as clean and safe. The senator spent about half an hour visiting with Zia S, who he described as hopeful; Blumenthal said a court hearing has been scheduled in Zia S’s case for September.
Blumenthal said that Zia S. has a big smile and described him as a lovely and decent human being. But he said, “the sadness is palpable, the pain is real. He is away from his family.”

William Cohen, a Vermont Supreme Court associate justice, plans to step down before the end of the year. 
He informed Gov. Phil Scott of his decision in a retirement letter dated July 28, and Scott confirmed the justice’s plan Thursday.
“He was a great appointment,” Scott said at his weekly press conference. 
Cohen joined the state’s highest court in 2019 after two decades as a trial judge. In his resignation letter, Cohen described himself as the longest active member of the state judiciary.  
Earlier this year, Associate Justice Karen Carroll also announced her plans to step down. Scott said the judicial nominating board has submitted names of potential candidates, and his administration would be reviewing possible replacements for both vacancies. 
Prior to becoming a judge, Cohen, who hails from Rutland, worked as a deputy state’s attorney and in private practice.
When appointed to the Supreme Court, Cohen described himself as “moderate, balancing the law with the human needs,” a sentiment echoed by others in the judicial system at the time.
“Throughout these years I have worked hard to serve the litigants with professionalism, integrity and fairness,” Cohen wrote in his letter to the governor, praising court staff and his fellow judges. “Vermont continues to have a strong and independent judiciary that will continue for a long time to come.”
In a press release from the Vermont State Court Administrator’s Office, Chief Justice Paul Reiber praised his colleague.
“Justice Cohen has been a valued colleague to every member of our court,” Reiber said. “He has been a mentor to young lawyers and a confidant to those facing life challenges.”
U.S. District Court Judge Mary Kay Lanthier similarly commended Cohen, recalling their time working in Rutland County’s courts. 
“Justice Cohen loved jury trials. He understood the critical role individual Vermonters play in our legal system,” she said in the release. “He knew Vermonters serving on juries took their responsibility seriously and relied on their collective experiences and wisdom to render just and fair verdicts. The State of Vermont will miss his service greatly.” 
An avid cyclist, Cohen said he looked forward to biking back roads in his new free time. Cohen’s retirement is effective Dec. 27, according to his letter.

Justices told a lower court to revisit their decision to uphold cuts of 75 percent to payments for solar panel owners.


The California Supreme Court today sided with environmental groups in a case seen as pivotal for the proliferation of rooftop solar power in California. 
In a unanimous vote, justices told a lower court to revisit a ruling that upheld reduced payments to solar panel owners for selling excess power back to utility companies. The lower court “erred by relying on [a] highly deferential approach” to reviewing decisions by state utility regulators, Justice Leondra Kruger wrote in the decision. The lower court used a standard dating to before  the state legislature expanded judicial review of the regulators’ decisions more than 25 years ago, she wrote.
The lower court of appeal had upheld the California Public Utilities Commission’s 2022 decision to reduce “net energy metering” payments to panel owners by about 75%. Although the Supreme Court said that ruling relied on the wrong legal standard, the higher court did not not rule on the legality of the reduced payments, leaving that for the lower court to decide under a different standard. 
“They basically said the lower court kind of punted on the whole substance of the [net metering] decision,” Bernadette Del Chiaro, vice president for California at the Environmental Working Group, said. “I do think they’re clearly stating this needs to be reviewed.”
The utility commission’s previous decision to change the net metering program was intended to help make bills affordable for all customers while still encouraging the adoption of renewable energy sources. Environmental groups argued in the case that the utility commission’s decision left out crucial considerations around benefits to customers and disadvantaged communities. 
Under previous iterations of the program – “NEM 1” and “NEM 2” – utilities paid solar customers a retail rate for their extra energy, which is the same price the utilities would charge other customers when they resold that energy. This was changed under the current iteration of the program – “NEM 3.0” – which instead gives customers the “avoided cost,” which is how much utilities save by not buying that power on the wholesale market. 
Customers who joined the program after mid-April 2023 receive the new rate, while customers under the prior two versions will continue to receive the old rate for the duration of their contracts, which is typically about 20 years.
Utility commissioners ruled in favor of power companies, which argued that older versions of the program created an unfair cost burden on customers. Those without rooftop solar, utilities said, have to pay more than their peers for routine maintenance to the grid. The groups bringing the lawsuit said this idea is overblown. 
Environmental groups said this decision left out considerations around the benefits to low-income customers, as well as the benefits of having “millions of customer generation facilities providing power on hot summer days and preventing blackouts,” Malinda Dickenson, representative of the three environmental groups, said at a June hearing.
The fallout from the utility commission’s 2022 decision included an 82% drop in customers requesting connections for rooftop solar installations, and industry groups expected a loss of about 17,000 jobs during the first year of the change. This is a developing story.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/021820_Solar-Panels_AW_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-07 13:56:37.303021

As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.

For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.

But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

(Photo courtesy of Grand View University)Grand View University in Des Moines has become the first university in Iowa to partner with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) to embed its provider certification into the college’s nursing program, a move officials say will help to start addressing needs for mental health training in the health care profession.
The private university announced in a news release Tuesday it is incorporating additional instruction into its psychiatric mental health course with training provided by NAMI staff for its bachelor of science in nursing, making it a requirement for all students in the program.
Nursing department chair Lisa Laughlin said in an interview the education students will receive through the NAMI training will help break down biases and offer a new perspective on mental health conditions and treatment.

“It’s such a huge and diverse population of people with mental illness, and (NAMI certification) just provides more resources, more understanding and a better baseline for how to work with patients and families,” Laughlin said.
Students will undertake an additional 15 hours of education and training in their psychiatric mental health course, Laughlin said, working with three instructors who will provide their perspectives as a health care professional with a background in mental health, someone who lives with or is recovering from a mental health diagnosis and a family member of someone with a mental health diagnosis.
New instruction from NAMI blends nicely with Grand View’s existing curriculum, Laughlin said, as the university has always taken a holistic approach to its nursing education.
According to the news release, nearly one in five U.S. adults are “experiencing a mental illness each year,” but less than half receive treatment. Laughlin said the new certification will only be a “drop in the puddle” of efforts by educators and the health care industry to address mental health needs, but it will help in drawing more attention to the problem.
According to Mid-Iowa Health Foundation, Des Moines University also partnered with NAMI in 2018 to train third-year osteopathic medical students in how to spot mental illnesses in patients and either treat them or refer to another caregiver. Mid-Iowa Health Foundation provided initial funding for the program.
“If you weren’t going into becoming a nurse specialized in psych mental health, then it wasn’t necessarily on your radar, but we work with patients with psych and mental health needs at … hospitals on every single floor,” Laughlin said. “So no matter where you end up as a nurse, it is a vital component of healthcare.”

Grazynski likes to go fly fishing, a technique using an artificial fly attached to a lightweight line. He says he always practices catch and release and uses the time to clear his mind.
“If anything’s going through my mind, then my line is going to get caught in a tree,” Grazynski said.
Grazynski is a member of a Connecticut chapter of Trout Unlimited, a conservation group, known as the Nutmeg Chapter. They say a portion of the Mill River in Fairfield near the Merritt Parkway is in need of restoration.
They say run-off from the roadway can harm aquatic wildlife, like trout, and the river has straightened in particular sections making it likely for river erosion to occur.
They are working on a plan for a restoration project that would make some sections of the river more curvy. The plan also calls for deepening the river bed to improve the habitat for trout and other wildlife.
The Mill River in Fairfield is more than 16 miles long. According to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) the river is an overall hospitable place for wild trout.
Joe Cassone, a fish biologist for DEEP’s Habitat Conservation and Enhancement Program, says the river stands out from others.
“This river is unique in that it originates in this part of the watershed, below Easton Reservoir. So, we’re getting good, cold, deep release water that makes this river cooler than it otherwise would be,” Cassone said.
Trout need cold water to survive, according to DEEP. While the river does support a wild trout population, some parts of the river do get shipments of captured trout by the state. The specific location where Grazynski fished, doesn’t. But it also doesn’t have much of a population, according to the Nutmeg Chapter.
Rich Rosen, the secretary and president of the Nutmeg Chapter, said the state doesn’t stock this section of the river over concerns it would impact the native population. But the Merritt Parkway doesn’t help the situation.
“The runoff goes right into the river, which is a problem, especially in the summer. You get heated water; trout will die at 70 degrees Fahrenheit,” Rosen said.
Rosen said the Merritt has also impacted the river in other ways. A section of the river, he said, is straighter than natural.
Cassone said the Merritt, like any other roadway, can impact the course of a waterway.
“There’s nothing uniquely impactful about the Merritt Parkway,” Cassone said. “When you put infrastructure, like a road in place, it becomes a fixed point. And rivers, over time, want to move and meander.”
Brian Eltz, a cold water fish biologist for DEEP, thinks the construction of the Merritt ended up inadvertently straightening a section of the river.
“We look at the stream, we don’t have any maps that show that there was definitely a rerouting of the river, but it definitely looks like it to our perspective, how it’s straight and it’s not sinuous, so it’s not curvy through there,” Eltz said.
Trout Unlimited’s Nutmeg Chapter plans to restore several sections of the Mill River, from Stratfield Road to Congress Street. Rosen said they will add rocks, riffles, strengthen the banks and deepen holes.
The holes are favored by trout where they can rest, and the group will also add boulders.
“They want to hunt for food, and they want to do it with the least amount of energy,” Rosen said. “So they’ll hide behind a rock where the current is slower, or in front of the rock, and they’ll wait for food to come down the river.”
Rosen estimates the total restoration project will cost anywhere from $50,000 to $55,000. The group has already raised $31,000. It hopes to start work on the project before next summer.
DEEP said the Nutmeg Chapter of Trout Unlimited has taken the lead on this, and DEEP is acting in a regulatory role.
Grazynski said the restoration of this section of the river would have positive impacts on the community as a whole. He said he became a fan of fly fishing during the pandemic after finding a discarded fishing rod in a parking lot.
He said working on this restoration project will allow him to have a say in the future of the river so his children can enjoy it too.
“I have two kids and I want them to have this resource both to have as a place to fish, but also, who wants to look at a spillway? Let’s make it look like the natural world,” Grazynski said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mill-River-fishing-1024x681.webp,,,2025-08-07 12:56:50.187456

The sports-betting lounge at the multi-use People’s Bank Arena in Hartford is being funded by Connecticut taxpayer dollars that repay bonds the state borrowed to build it.
The state agency Capital Region Development Authority, which stimulates economic development and investments in and around the Hartford region, manages the People’s Bank Arena, formerly known as the XL Center. 
For the 2023-2024 Fiscal Year, the General Assembly authorized CRDA to borrow $125 billion dollars in bonds from investors through the Connecticut State Bond Commission to improve the arena.
The sports-betting lounge, which opened in 2023, was constructed with a portion of these funds. The bonds are being repaid over the next 20 years using taxes collected from Connecticut state residents, such as income and sales tax.
Since its opening, the lounge has been losing money, and by the end of the 2025 fiscal year, it’s on track to lose $200,000.

Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said he would reverse approval of the large wind farm project that had been approved to be built outside of Twin Falls on land managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.
The company Magic Valley Energy had sought a permit to build more than 200 wind turbines that would generate an expected 1,000 megawatts.
Burgum said in a press release Wednesday that his office reviewed the decision approving the project and “discovered crucial legal deficiencies in the issuance of the approval.”
The project, which began permitting in 2019, drew deep criticism from Idaho Republican officials, including Gov. Brad Little, U.S. Rep Mike Simpson and U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo. President Donald Trump temporarily halted the project through an executive order in January, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. His order directed the federal agency to review the project.
“Idahoans have spoken loud and clear over the last few years: the Lava Ridge Wind Project has no place in our state,” Simpson said Wednesday in an emailed statement. “Today’s decision confirms that common sense and the will of the people prevailed.”
Crapo also celebrated the decision.
“This harmful proposal by the previous Administration willfully neglected widespread opposition from the local community,” Crapo said in a statement. “I am glad to see President Donald Trump fulfilling his commitment to making sure Idaho voices on this matter were heard and respected.”
Little in January also issued an executive order in tandem with the presidents’ to direct state agencies to cooperate with the review of the project and encourage the public to share their concerns about it with the federal agency.
 Environmental groups encourage other renewable energy projects

When the president first halted the project, the environmental group Idaho Conservation League argued that other renewable energy projects should be considered, especially in Idaho where much of the state’s energy is imported from elsewhere.
About 40% of Idaho’s power is generated out of the state, the Sun previously reported.
“While the Lava Ridge Project wasn’t perfect, we desperately need to develop new sources of renewable energy in order to meet the growing demand for electricity and replace carbon-emitting coal and gas power plants,” the league said in a previous statement. 
The Idaho Conservation League could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Vice President JD Vance spent several hours in the Hoosier State Thursday to meet with Gov. Mike Braun and other leaders about the possibility of creating more GOP seats with redrawn congressional boundaries.
The visit came amid a tussle in Republican-held Texas over new maps — and threats from Democrat-run states to retaliate.
Braun told reporters the Statehouse meeting went “pretty good” and that “we covered a wide array of topics.” He confirmed that at least part of the discussion was about redistricting, specifically. 
When asked if state and federal officials came to any agreement, the governor said only that “we listened.”
House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate Pro Tem Rodric Bray, both Republicans, were also present, but neither answered questions after the meeting.
State lawmakers redraw districts after each decennial census, as per the Indiana Constitution. They last did so in 2021. Congressional Republicans have a 7-2 advantage.

It was great to meet with @VP Vance today. We discussed a number of issues, and I was pleased to highlight some of the great things happening in Indiana.
— Governor Mike Braun (@GovBraun) August 7, 2025

A move in Indiana would likely focus on the First District in northwest Indiana, which is held by U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, a Democrat.
The governor would need to call a special session to move forward with any mid-cycle redistricting.
During the visit, several hundred Hoosiers, many of them angry and cursing, rallied at the Indiana Statehouse to protest against the proposal.
Julia Vaughn, the executive director of Common Cause Indiana, vowed to challenge any maps that came from a special session.
“We will see you in court, Gov. Braun,” said Vaughn, whose organization was heavily involved in the last redistricting session in 2021. She called on the crowd to return to the statehouse tenfold if a special session was called, noting that her organization gave Indiana’s maps a ‘D’ grade.
“… Leave our congressional maps alone!”
Pushback at the statehouse
Vance arrived at the Indiana Statehouse shortly before 10:30 a.m. and spent just shy of an hour in Braun’s office.
After the meeting — and before heading back to the nation’s capital — the vice president headlined a national Republican fundraising event held just blocks away in downtown Indianapolis.
All the while, those opposed to redistricting staged an hours-long sit-in at the statehouse.

“This is clearly a power grab,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis. “This is simply an attempt by the President to stay in power forever.”
Redistricting efforts in Texas, where President Donald Trump said Republicans were “entitled” to more seats, have stalled after Democrats fled the state.

With razor-thin margins in the U.S. House of Representatives, netting more GOP-controlled seats in the 2026 midterm would protect Trump’s priorities in the second half of his term.
Republicans control seven out of Indiana’s nine seats in the U.S. House. Democrats hold seats in Indianapolis and in the northwestern part of the state.
In order to redistrict, Republicans would have to call a special session – which comes at a cost. A two-week special session in 2022 cost $240,000.
One of Mrvan’s constituents, Jillian Schranz, came from northwestern Indiana Thursday to protest against the proposed redistricting.
“I think gerrymandering is not new. Democrats do it; Republicans do it,” Schranz said. “But the fact that we’re talking about a special session and not waiting for census data is really alarming.”
She said she’d heard about ongoing budget concerns directly from her General Assembly lawmakers, Sen. Dan Dernulc and Rep. Hal Slager. She emailed both Republican men to ask for their perspective on redistricting.

“It would be hypocritical for Indiana Republicans to call the special session,” Schranz concluded.

Beth McClellan, from the north side of Indianapolis, arrived at the state capitol building shortly before 9 a.m. and said she’s also concerned about a possible re-draw of Indiana’s 5th District, which has become increasingly competitive after years of Republican dominance.
“The idea of redrawing our districts … it’s ludicrous, it’s bad optics and it’s a bad idea,” she said. “We’re a red state — already with Republican dominated seats here and in Washington. … Our elected officials should be focused on issues, not playing around with maps.” 
Will redistricting happen?
Pete Seat, a longtime Indiana Republican strategist and national political commentator, said he senses a lot of hesitancy among GOP leaders in Indiana.
He noted there is an “element of Hoosier hospitality involved and an open ear, but maybe not an open mind.”

Seat said with Republican supermajorities controlling both the House and Senate it would not be a heavy lift. But it would go against two decades of messaging that Indiana handles its map-drawing process the right way.
“We take a lot of pride in our map and how we draw our districts and the thought put behind it and maintaining communities of interest and respecting existing boundaries,” he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “Do you really want to go back on that?”
The former White House spokesman said he doesn’t know if there is compelling data pointing to the need for a mid-decade redistricting.
“But I mean, look, we live in a transparent political environment with Donald Trump at the helm, and I think the rationale would be naked politics,” he said. “Not a lot of people hide from that these days, ‘yeah we want more seats to be in the U.S. House of Representatives.’ So what?”
Seat doesn’t think there would be a political cost to Indiana Republicans related to backlash against them for drawing maps early. But he noted there could be a cost based on how the new boundaries line up.
“There’s going to be some lines that shift. How does that impact the incumbents or future candidates in those newly drawn districts? There’s a ripple effect,” he said.
Seat discounted the cost of a special session as being a factor in any decision.
“If this is something you feel needs to be done, the cost of it is relative peanuts to other other issues,” he said. “I don’t think that’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back.”

(Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring those with account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.

The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
40 million subscribers
Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”

Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
States step in
In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.” 










In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections. 


– State Rep. Zack Gramlich, R-Arkansas


This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.

Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

Laura Kelly picks an attorney in private practice to serve on Kansas Supreme Court, bypassing two district court judges also nominated for the post.","Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, chose Leawood attorney Larkin Walsh from among three nominees to fill a vacancy on the seven-member Kansas Supreme Court. (Pool photo by Evert Nelson/Topeka Capital-Journal)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly appointed an attorney in private practice who has argued cases before the state and federal appellate courts to fill a vacancy on the Kansas Supreme Court.
The governor said Thursday that she’d selected Larkin Walsh from among three finalists nominated by a merit-selection commission. She will replace Justice Evelyn Wilson, a Kelly appointee, who resigned July 4.
The selection by Kelly was the Democratic governor’s fourth appointment to the seven-justice Supreme Court.
“Larkin’s extensive legal experience and her background of service makes her an excellent addition to the Kansas Supreme Court,” Kelly said in a press release. “Her deep understanding of appellate courts, combined with her breadth of experience in civil practice, gives her a unique and invaluable perspective.”
Walsh has been a lawyer with the Stueve Siegel and Hanson law firm since 2024. Her primary areas of focus include appellate, civil rights, consumer protection, and labor and employment law. She has briefed and argued cases in the Kansas appellate courts, as well as in the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Sixth Circuit, Ninth Circuit, Tenth Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court.
She spent eight years advising the judiciary at the federal district court and state appellate court levels. Walsh was a clerk for U.S. District Court Judge Carlos Murguia and was a research attorney for former Kansas Supreme Court Justice Carol Beier.
Walsh earned bachelor’s degrees at Southern Methodist University and a law degree from the University of Kansas.
“I am deeply honored by the governor’s trust, humbled by her confidence and grateful for the opportunity to serve the people of Kansas as a member of our state’s highest court,” Walsh said.
She said she had a “profound respect for the institution of the judiciary, its role in our three-part system of government and the responsibility of a justice to protect the foundational principles set forth in our state and federal constitutions.”
In 20 years practicing law, Walsh said her experiences reinforced her commitment to the fundamental mission of the courts to ensure access to fair and impartial justice through adherence to the rule of law.
“I will strive to be the type of justice that all Kansans deserve,” she said. “One who, with a clear understanding of the legal issues, will faithfully interpret and impartially apply the law to the unique facts of each case, irrespective of popular opinion or the political winds, while maintaining an awareness of each decision’s impact on people and on history. The citizens of Kansas deserve nothing less.”

The book’s title may lead some to envision a connection to the University of South Carolina mascot. However, while there are cockfights in the book — which, by the way, are still misdemeanors in South Carolina — the subject matter has more to do with an individual caught in an unfair system where the evidence against him is flawed.
It cuts in both directions.
A few years back, I learned that a crime lab in Louisville, Kentucky, was mishandling DNA evidence.
And there is a direct connection to South Carolina. On May 14, 2020, Gov. Henry McMaster signed the Statewide Sexual Assault Kit Tracking Law (H3309).
This law aims to ensure law enforcement, crime labs and medical facilities keep track of evidence, such as rape kits, and “empower survivors with information, assist law enforcement with investigations and crime prevention, create transparency, and foster public trust.”
South Carolinians pushing for that law included the survivor of a horrific rape and beating in Kentucky, who learned nearly two decades later the evidence in her case had long been destroyed.
It was destroyed at the same Kentucky lab that instilled my writing of the book.
Failure to properly store, handle or analyze evidence can result in guilty people going free, as well as innocent people being wrongfully charged.
As a criminal defense attorney in federal and state matters for 38 years, I envisioned what could go wrong when a crime lab mishandles DNA evidence.
The main character is a Teacher of the Year caught up in the process. The book is fact-based fiction. But the idea that DNA evidence can be subject to mishandling, and that analysis and results can be subject to someone’s laziness, incompetence, deceit, or overworked schedule, is distressing to say the least.
Sadly, it actually happens in the real world.
On Jan. 23 of this year, a Colorado crime lab DNA analyst was charged with dozens of counts of forgery. She’s accused of mishandling and tampering with evidence over 15 years, sending more than 1,000 cases into question.
In “The Cockfight,” the main character loses everything and is sent to various federal prisons, including the one in rural Bennettsville.
The main character in the book, “Teach,” explains the circumstances surrounding his case, and the various facilities he was placed in. The book labels it as “social welfare at the expense of human bondage.”
What’s worse is that we continue to punish offenders even after they are released.
With felony records, there is no real way that they will ever obtain meaningful work or be allowed to become productive members of society.
“The Cockfight” is the story of the teacher’s fight to clear his name. It is a book about injustice and redemption.
It compares how we treat people caught in the system to cockfights.
We make them mean and angry toward each other, and no one wins — not the victims of crime nor those caught in the broken system.
It was written to illustrate what can happen when things go wrong, and it is my hope that the message in the book leads to both a change in attitude and in action.
Further, I hope those who are victims of criminal acts will be comforted with knowing that the perpetrators will be brought to justice and that innocent people will be protected from a flawed system.

In recent decades, historic mills and old industrial buildings in Gateway Cities across the state have been renovated and converted into much-needed housing. But while Eastern Massachusetts cities have had success, cities farther west with weaker housing markets still struggle with an array of blighted properties that have yet to be developed.
The post ‘Eas[...]","WHILE WALKING along Holyoke’s sprawling canals, it’s hard to ignore the former mill city’s industrial past and historic design. Established as a textile and paper manufacturing center, Holyoke became the largest producer of paper goods in the country by 1885. It was also home to some of the largest silk and alpaca wool mills in the world.  
Now, dozens of those old mills sit boarded up along the canal system and have been mostly vacant for decades. Some are close to collapsing, while others are covered in graffiti. Scattered across the center of downtown, the battered brick buildings are an untapped opportunity and serve as a constant reminder to city leaders of what could be.  
In recent decades, historic mills and old industrial buildings in Gateway Cities across the Commonwealth have been renovated and converted into much-needed housing. The projects are often a way for cities to preserve their historic charm while creating modern residential units in high demand. They also help to revitalize post-industrial era cities that suffered from the long-term decline of manufacturing.  
But while Eastern Massachusetts cities like Lowell and Lawrence have had success – with almost no former industrial buildings left to restore – cities farther west with weaker housing markets, which don’t enjoy the luxury of being connected to Greater Boston via the commuter rail, still struggle with an array of blighted properties that have yet to be developed. In these communities – like Holyoke, Springfield, and Fitchburg – the housing market doesn’t support rents that attract developers for these projects. 
State and federal funding is almost always needed, but those tax credits and payouts come slowly to only a handful of developers who are willing to invest years into a project before making a profit. But many aren’t willing to stick around, according to Aaron Vega, Holyoke’s director of planning and economic development.  
“It’s hard to get state money. There’s a backlog,” said Cassandra Witthaus, associate director of real estate at The Neighborhood Developers, a nonprofit affordable housing developer in Chelsea, Revere, and Everett. “It might take a year or two, sometimes longer than that, depending on the project.”  
The stigma that comes with being a diverse, low-income city is another factor that stunts housing development in Holyoke. Small businesses that would otherwise promote growth and further development don’t want to open next to old, blighted buildings that are boarded up, Vega said.  
“Developers seem to just pass Holyoke by, and that’s where the perception comes in,” said local resident and developer Denis Luzuriaga. “That whole perception of Holyoke being bad – plus developers just not seeing the right kind of projects here – I think we’re somewhat stuck. The question is, how long will it take? Will it be years, or decades?”  
Even with a 10-year anchor tenant providing a stable source of revenue, most banks turned Luzuriaga and his brother Marco down when they asked for a loan to fund a small restoration project that ultimately created 18 market-rate apartments in an old wire manufacturing mill. Some said it was too risky because the brothers were first-time developers, according to Luzuriaga. Others said they wouldn’t loan the money because the project was in Holyoke.  
The restoration project was lucky to receive funding from the state’s Housing Development Incentive Program – the only state tax incentive for market-rate housing in Gateway Cities. City officials say the program is essential in areas like Holyoke, where market conditions create barriers to private investment. But Marco Luzuriaga said competition for HDIP funding is high, and they were turned down for other projects despite having architectural plans and cost estimates.  
These restoration projects are often seen as a cheaper and faster alternative to new housing construction, which developers say couldn’t be further from the truth. 
Blighted properties and century-old mills often require extensive environmental clean-up and remediation efforts, which is time-consuming, expensive, and drives developers away. Five developers have backed out of restoring the 230,000-square-foot former Merrick Thread Mill because the cost alone to get the building “site ready” has been estimated between $12 million and $20 million. Half of the building needs to be torn down, and the lead paint, asbestos, and other contaminants need to be abated.

“I joke about how much money has to go into a property before you even put up drywall,” Vega said.  
MassDevelopment – a state agency intended to improve economic growth – offers site-readiness grants, but Vega said it isn’t nearly enough to cover the remediation costs in many of the mill buildings in Holyoke. The state will pay around $40,000 to cover deed research, an appraisal, a survey to ensure they have the right property lines, and hiring a structural engineer who can assess whether the building is stable – a far cry from the millions of dollars needed to get a building like the former Merrick Thread Mill ready for development. 
In some cases, the stars have aligned – allowing a handful of historic mills and old buildings in Holyoke to be converted into market-rate or affordable housing. These bright spots are slowly helping to revitalize the city while serving as a model for other potential projects, but there’s still a long way to go.  
WinnDevelopment, the housing construction arm of WinnCompanies that has championed mill restoration projects around the state, is now finalizing some 86 units of affordable housing in the old Farr Alpaca Mill – a five-story property covering over 161,000 square feet on the Holyoke canal that has been vacant since the 1970s. It was one of Holyoke’s largest and most run-down historic wool mills. The units will be ready for residents in a matter of weeks and will rent for around $1,000 per month.

Funded in part by federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits, low-income housing tax credits, and other loans from the state – the project took 10 years to complete. 
“Ten years to get 86 units of housing. We’re not solving the housing crisis at that rate anytime soon,” Vega said. “The state has great programs, but you don’t get everything all at once. An empty mill building that’s already been empty for 20 years – every year, every winter, every rainstorm, more water in the building – it just gets worse and worse. What might have been a $28 million project 10 years ago is now a $40 million project.”  
But the requirements established by historic tax credit programs sometimes clash with building code requirements. For example, a historic commission might tell a developer to preserve an old stairway railing, while state building codes require it to be raised six inches, Vega said.  
Unlike most other mill buildings in Holyoke, the city owned the property, which made acquisition cheaper and easier for Winn. The city also held the mill for 10 years so Winn didn’t have to pay taxes on it. WinnDevelopment counsel and project director Hagop Toghramadjian said Holyoke has remained patient – knowing that these types of risky restoration projects take time, and state funding trickles in ever-so-slowly.  
“Other private sellers and cities aren’t as patient, which kills a project,” Toghramadjian said.  
Unlike many other developers, Winn is mission-driven and in it for the long haul. Most would balk at a 10-year timeline, Vega said, but Winn typically holds on to their properties and is not looking for a quick return on investment. 
“When you start, you have to have a really healthy amount set aside for unknowns,” Toghramadjian said.  
While developing the property’s parking lot across the canal, Winn discovered an entire buried mill. Asbestos and other contaminants had been pushed underground where the drainage structure was meant to go, which required remediation and added a $1 million cost to the project.  
The Brownfields Tax Credit Program offers credits to cover costs incurred during the clean-up of contaminated properties, but Toghramadjian said the state only provides that funding for the costs that developers know about before they start. 
“So you have to know what you’re doing, but you’re always finding things in these buildings,” Marco Luzuriaga said.  
A roof collapsed unexpectedly during the renovation, which required the installation of steel bracing from the outside and raised costs by another $1 million, Toghramadjian said.

The cost of housing construction is just as high in cities like Holyoke as it is in Greater Boston communities, but the rents that can be charged are much lower. This creates a funding gap when developers determine whether they can make a profit from a project.  
“In Lowell, it’s a smaller gap. Here, the gap is tremendous. It’s enormous. It’s not just a little finger on the scale, it’s the entire project,” Toghramadjian said. “The rents pay for virtually nothing…the rents will get you further in Lowell.”  
People earn higher incomes in Lawrence and Lowell than they do in Holyoke, allowing housing developers in those Eastern Massachusetts cities to bank on higher market rents to make projects work. In 2022, only a third of the units in Lawrence’s redeveloped mills were considered affordable, according to Jessica Andors – executive director of Lawrence CommunityWorks. 
In cities like Holyoke where the housing market doesn’t support higher rents, developers opt for affordable housing to help close that gap upfront with low-income housing tax credits rather than wait to make a profit from market-rate rents. Vega said they need a mix of both to secure a healthy housing market that also attracts people with higher incomes to the city.  
The state’s Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit program covered 10 percent of Winn’s project in Holyoke – which made converting the historic mill more attractive than starting from scratch, said Toghramadjian. With fewer applicants, the program is less competitive than other low-income housing incentive programs, but it still takes a long time to be paid. Small amounts are committed to the project every few months, according to Toghramadjian.  
He said the secret to developing more vacant, blighted properties in cities like Holyoke is to expand both the state and federal historic tax credit programs and deliver the funding faster. He pointed to other states like North Carolina, which have low-income tax credit programs that are focused specifically on the development of mills.

“You have to expand and create a new, focused program on mills in Gateway Cities that isn’t just $500,000,” Toghramadjian said. “We’re talking tens of millions of dollars per project.”  
Large projects like Winn’s are few and far between in Holyoke, and the city is in need of more experienced developers to take on bigger projects. But that alone won’t solve the problem.  
“Even if I had five big developers in Holyoke like WinnDevelopment, they are all going to be fighting for the same pot of money,” Vega said.  
Private property owners are often unable to navigate the state and federal funding system, and some decide not to convert the mills at all. Vega said Holyoke largely relies on small, local developers that work closely with the city, are located nearby, and aren’t interested in making a fast profit. While these developers help to restore smaller buildings – such as 10 or 15-unit projects – they often lack the staff needed to navigate grants, tax credits, and regulations that accompany larger mill restorations.   
“They’re really expensive to do, but their value isn’t just in the dollars and cents,” Toghramadjian said. The projects can, over the long term, be profitable, he said. But they’re also helping to “turn Holyoke around.”

Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When there’s a maternal health emergency, Jessica Wheat springs into action.
Alongside a group of specialized health providers at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Wheat works fast to make sure patients are able to have their babies delivered safely or their children given critical treatment at the Level III neonatal intensive care unit on site.
“We have just an abundance of resources, and people that know what they’re doing,” the labor and delivery nurse said.
That abundance is coming to an end. Last month, HCA Midwest Health, which owns Research Medical Center, announced it was closing its obstetrics program and NICU. The umbrella company that runs HCA Midwest Health, which oversees multiple hospitals and related sites of care in nearly two dozen states, cited declining births at the hospital as part of its reasons for the closure.
Wheat is worried about the implications for local patients who often struggle to find transportation even across Kansas City. But she’s also concerned about the rural patients outside of the metro area.
“We tend to get smaller hospitals that will Life Flight bleeding moms or moms who are breech or moms who are having a hypertensive crisis,” she said. “We can do the emergency C-section — a lot of smaller hospitals do not have those capabilities. The farther they have to go, the more at risk they’re going to be for complications, even death.”
The availability of obstetrics care in America has been dwindling for years. That could accelerate now, as hospital leaders across the country warn that President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income Americans, could leave pregnant people in rural communities with vanishingly few options for medical care. 
Obstetrics is one of the most expensive services provided by hospitals, especially in rural areas, which often see a larger portion of Medicaid patients. Nationwide, the program pays for about 40 percent of all births. With financial hits looming, hospitals are primed to close maternity wards first, and rural areas are particularly vulnerable.
“This is going to have an enormous impact,” said Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people. “Already we’re seeing OB deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”
For years, hospitals facing financial pressure have shuttered maternity wards. Between 2010 and 2022, more than 500 hospitals across the country dropped obstetrics, per a recent study that also shows more than half of rural counties now have no hospital-based obstetric services. A report from the advocacy group March of Dimes found that 1 in 3 U.S. counties had no OBGYN at all.

There are numerous reasons for the recent closures, ranging from declining births to difficulties hiring local providers. But the biggest issue is financial: Hospitals typically don’t earn enough from labor and delivery to cover the cost. Now, cuts to Medicaid — which will further cut hospital revenues and increase their share of uncompensated care — threaten to strain finances further.
“I do have a lot of concern that we’ll continue to see labor and delivery units close in rural hospitals and potentially even at an accelerated rate, as hospitals feel greater strain due to cuts in the bill,” said Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association.
The National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, a consulting firm, estimated in June that the proposed Medicaid cuts over 10 years could reach almost $70 billion just for rural hospitals. Nearly half of all children and 1 in 5 adults in rural communities are enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program. The health insurance plan also pays hospitals less for the same services than private insurance does.
“When rural hospitals say, ‘We have these big Medicaid cuts, how do we deal with that shortfall?’ the OB units are going to be first on the chopping block,” said Jamie Daw, an associate professor of health policy at Columbia University.
One analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonpartisan organization that supports policies such as equal pay and access to health care, suggests that the new cuts to Medicaid put almost 150 rural hospitals with maternity services at risk of serious downsizing or closing altogether.
The changes to Medicaid — including cumbersome new paperwork requirements for people insured through the program, and cuts to some of the taxes used to finance state Medicaid programs — largely won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. But already, hospitals are preparing for huge reductions in services, and pointing to labor and delivery as one of their most vulnerable offerings.
Michigan-based Trinity Health operates five hospitals that include maternity services. Hospital leaders are deeply concerned about service cuts that would make it harder for pregnant patients to get appropriate medical care, said Dr. Sharon O’Leary, an OBGYN and the organization’s chief data analytics and chief equity officer.
When patients have to travel further for prenatal care, they are more likely to cut the number of doctors’ visits or to receive no prenatal care at all. Studies over the past several years have shown that obstetrics unit closures — and increased travel time for pregnant patients — result in higher rates of pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and low birth weight. 
“Our biggest fear is that as women lose coverage that they will not seek prenatal care,” O’Leary said.
The consequences are likely to be heightened in areas that are already underserved, and where birth outcomes are worse: rural parts of the country, and, in particular, large swaths of the South.

“While we are concerned about the impact the bill will have on all hospital services, we are particularly concerned about its impact on labor and delivery services,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
Already, rural areas have seen access to reproductive care dwindling, particularly in the past three years, since the fall of Roe v. Wade allowed states to outlaw abortion. Preliminary data shows that medical residents for OBGYN are applying in smaller numbers to states with abortion bans and a recent study in the medical journal JAMA, the first to assess the relationship between abortion bans and provider availability, found that in Idaho, the number of OBGYNs fell by 35 percent between August 2022 — when the state implemented its near-total ban — and December 2024.
Abortion ban states, which are largely in the South, also have higher rural populations, worse birth outcomes and larger shares of hospitals at risk of closure. 
“It’s an additional trend — on top of this piece of the general financial pressure  — that’s going to also affect predominantly rural Southern communities,” Daw said. “It seems like a perfect storm of these concurrent trends really really affecting access to care.”
If hospitals reduce their pregnancy-related offerings, few alternatives will be able to fill in the gap. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began withholding millions of dollars in family planning grants through Title X, the federal program that supports family planning services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood, a major provider of services that include cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, is also one of the largest Title X providers. Most Planned Parenthood clinics are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The federal budget and tax law also includes a provision that would cut federal Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, though that policy has since been blocked by a federal court ruling. In recent weeks, several clinics have announced their plans to close. 
“You have to think of them as related,” Daw said. “It’s definitely not helpful to have all of these changes happening at the same time and really undermining the safety net for reproductive-aged women.”
Cochran-McClain said when a provider with a background in obstetrics care leaves a rural town or city, that impacts health services more broadly: Often, that provider was also providing contraception, general gynecological care and routine screenings.
“It’s so interconnected. While we’re talking specifically about labor, delivery and pregnancy, it can have an impact more broadly on access to women’s health in rural communities,” she said. “It’s been a rough couple of years before all of this, so it just feels like it’s a worsening trend in terms of overall access.”
The closure at Research Medical Center in Kansas City — where its obstetrics program is scheduled to close down in early September — also shows that even when a person in a rural area is forced to travel greater distances into a city setting for specialized care, those services aren’t guaranteed.
Wheat and other affected nurses at Research Medical Center, where they are represented by National Nurses United, said HCA Midwest Health has not provided enough information about the logistics of winding down services. Will the rest of the hospital, including its ICU unit, take emergency patients who need labor and delivery services? Or will the remaining staff in other areas of the hospital get specialized training?
HCA Midwest Health, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The 19th, said in a statement to a media outlet that it is working with area health providers to ensure patients have other delivery options.
Wheat has lined up another nursing job in labor and delivery with a different hospital system. In her text group chats with other impacted staff, there is a sense of sadness. She believes the obstetrics-related health providers will find other work, even if it means even more gas mileage to get to a new job. But Wheat keeps thinking about what’s to come for the patients.
“I’m emotionally exhausted. It is hard,” she said. “We’re just grieving for the community at this point, because we know they’re going to have a lot of issues after we’re gone.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185345/3X0A2134-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-07 11:59:16.071423

Third Circuit Court Judge Kevin Cox issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday against Wayne Disposal Inc., preventing it from receiving radioactive waste at its site located along the I-94 Service Drive.
The decision to move the waste to Michigan came as a surprise to Wayne County residents, who first learned of the decision in August 2024 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers informed the township that 6,000 cubic yards of soil and 4,000 gallons of groundwater contaminated with radiation would be transported to the area for disposal. 
The waste was produced as a byproduct of developing the atomic bomb in World War II.
“We are beyond thrilled of the news of the ruling” Van Buren Township Supervisor Kevin McNamara said in a press release. “We did everything in our power to safeguard our residents in stopping out-of-state radioactive waste from entering our community and we feel vindicated by this ruling.”

Press Release Aug 6 2025 
Joining Van Buren Township in filing the lawsuit that sought the injunction were Canton Township, the cities of Belleville and Romulus, and Wayne County, which came after they learned radioactive waste from the Niagara Falls Storage Site in Lewiston, New York, was headed to the landfill. 
“We stood strong with our community allies speaking collectively with one voice that we do not want this type of waste in our community. By doing so we sent a statement to our lawmakers that has triggered legislation providing further protection against receiving radioactive waste that is pending in the state legislature,” McNamara said.
That legislation, Senate Bill 246, was introduced by state Sen. Darren Camilleri (D-Trenton) and would, among other things, prohibit further disposal in Michigan of “natural radioactive materials whose concentrations have been increased by human activity.”
It would also increase fees and surcharges for the disposal of specific hazardous waste and ensure those funds are used in the affected communities.
Similar legislation was passed by the state Senate last December, but failed to make it through the House during the lame duck session.

(Getty Images)Drunken drivers who travel the wrong way down New Hampshire roads will face steeper penalties under a new state law.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 776, which was sponsored by state Rep. Terry Roy, into law last week, which makes wrong-way driving an “aggravating factor” for driving while intoxicated in New Hampshire, meaning it leads to more severe penalties than a typical DWI.
A person convicted of aggravated DWI faces a class A misdemeanor offense that comes with a fine of at least $750, 17 days or more in jail — 12 of which may be suspended but at least five must be served — and license suspension for at least 18 months, under state law. If the person causes a serious accident in the process, the conviction increases to a class B felony, with a fine of $1,000 or more and 35 or more days in jail (21 of those may be suspended; the other 14 must be served). Those convicted on a regular DWI charge on first offense face a class B misdemeanor, a fine of just $500, and a shorter license suspension. Those convicted of aggravated DWI may also have a Breathalyzer device installed in their car’s ignition.
Lt. Chris Storm of the New Hampshire State Police told state senators in April that wrong-way driving is a big problem in the state and that law enforcement receives reports of it nearly every day.
The law also has an unrelated provision that names the Virginia opossum the state marsupial of New Hampshire. Any Virginia opossums found in New Hampshire are now to be known as “New Hampshire opossums” under state law. This provision of the law — which was originally a standalone bill but later grouped in with HB 776 through an amendment — was backed by state Sen. Donovan Fenton, a Keene Democrat, who said fifth graders from the Chesterfield School in Chesterfield requested he file it.

Important as it is, the housing imperative is the least of our problems. Growth comes with costs that Earth can no longer bear.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Miriam Voran: Environmental overshoot in our Vermont backyard.","This commentary is by Miriam Voran, who practices psychoanalytic psychotherapy in Montpelier and West Lebanon. She is a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.


It’s indisputable: We have a crisis. 
A housing crisis, we call it. More people want to live in Vermont than we can support. The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development predicts we will need at least 24,000 new homes over the next five years. With an aging population, Vermont faces a workforce shortage. Without more housing, we’re warned, Vermont’s economy will die.  
Vermont’s lack of affordable housing is also immoral. The present shortage drives home prices and rents sky-high. We are seeing more unhoused individuals, more whose housing costs outpace their income, and many middle and low-income families who simply cannot afford to buy homes. 
We dare not become the playground of the wealthy, the privileged who protect their bit of paradise.  
To solve the crisis, Vermont has loosened environmental regulations in developed districts and funded infrastructure to encourage growth. More housing, we believe, is an economic and moral imperative. Yet, we are tortured to see the clear-cutting of land and the loss of cooling vegetation and wildlife habitat — all to build more hardscaping that sheds water and reflects heat and to house ever more humans.
Important as it is, the housing imperative is the least of our problems. Growth comes with costs that Earth can no longer bear. In 2020, humanity crossed an unthinkable line: the mass of human-made stuff exceeded all living biomass on Earth. 
We’ve blown past our right-sized place on the planet. We’re just one of over 8 million species, but we’re crowding out the rest of nature. We’re losing birds, wild mammals, reptiles and insects at an unprecedented rate. We’re destroying the climate, and we’re destroying the lacework of life.  
We’re in overshoot. Overshoot occurs when a species’ population outgrows its environment.  Earth Overshoot Day is the day by which we’ve exhausted all the resources that Earth can generate for the year. This year, it arrived on July 24, eight days earlier than last year. For the next five months, we are stealing resources from future generations. We’re spewing pollution Earth cannot absorb. Humanity now uses 1.8 Earths each year. 
Ecologists say that even experts cannot understand our nightmare. Even they underestimate the challenges of avoiding a ghastly future. 
Overshoot will likely cause the collapse of global supply chains, violent conflicts over shrinking resources, mass migrations from climate change and the hoarding of remaining wealth by a few. 
No governmental body can address the crisis. A population decline during the second half of this century is inevitable. The only question is, do we decline deliberately or do we crash?  
From pandemics and floods to President Donald Trump’s dismantling of almost everything, we daily experience unimaginable destruction. Some claim that the worldwide rise in authoritarian populist leaders is itself a symptom of overshoot. 
There’s a certain tribalism here in Vermont. It is, perhaps, just as dangerous as isolationism. Our tribalism is pro-growth. We’re pro-housing, pro-worker immigration, pro-economic expansion. This, we’re told, leads to abundance and a sustainable future. We’re clinging to outdated views of security. We’re protecting our tribal interests while destroying Earth as a sustainable home for biodiverse life.     
In times of crisis, morality changes. The old morality of individual rights no longer works.  Because we’re trapped in a bad-ending game, morality must adjust to the vital needs of the larger human community. This means not just the community in front of us, but the community of the future, a community that exists within ecological limits. Survival ethics requires changing our morality and changing our game.  
It’s almost impossible to imagine such change. But if humanity is to survive, the ecologists say we will need to down-size the global population between 2 billion and 3 billion. 
Anticipating the collapse of global supply chains, we would want to right-size local populations to fit regional resources. Sure, this threatens endless economic growth. But there is an alternative: the steady-state economy that fits within ecological limits.  
Without this ethical shift, we’re marching off the cliff, like the mythical lemmings. It’s the legacy of our infancy. We never forget those early days of helplessness, screaming in our cribs, utterly dependent on the kindness of caregivers. We learn from the beginning to fit in and please. It’s the way we keep resources coming. 
Over the years, the urge to please and belong extends to friends, employers, community, even the broader culture. We embrace business as usual, even bad business, to belong. We don’t ask uncomfortable questions or start awkward conversations for fear of being ostracized.
Let us hope we can find our collective capacity to tolerate our fear of ostracism. Maybe, when our hearts are shattered, we’ll find our courage to look reality in the eye and speak truth to each other.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-07 14:55:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT stands to lose millions if EPA kills ‘Solar for All’ program,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/07/solar-for-all-ct-trump-clawback/,CT was awarded over $62 million for clean energy projects under the program. Now the Trump administration reportedly seeks to claw it back.,"A reported plan by the Trump administration to take back $7 billion in grant money from a nationwide solar program for low-income and disadvantaged communities called Solar For All would put an end to several clean energy projects in Connecticut, officials with the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said.
The anticipated clawback was first reported this week by the New York Times, which said the 60 entities in 49 states that had been awarded grants could receive termination letters from the Environmental Protection Agency as soon as this week.
“If federal support is withdrawn, states like Connecticut could be forced to halt or delay shovel-ready projects that are prepared to cut costs, clean the air, and make our grid more resilient,” DEEP spokesman James Fowler said in an email. “It would come at a time of record energy prices, rising electricity demand, and growing strain on households and infrastructure.” 
Connecticut’s award under Solar for All is $62.45 million. It was announced April 22, 2024 and fully obligated on July 12 of that year — which should insulate it from losing funding. 
But the program’s money comes via the Inflation Reduction Act, a prime recission target of Donald J. Trump’s administration — along with many of the populations Solar For All was designed to serve. 
It is also part of a $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Trump administration has already targeted $20 million of that for clawbacks, which has resulted in legal action — already ongoing for months.
Representatives for the EPA didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
“The award is a cornerstone of our affordability and energy justice efforts, and Connecticut is already well into the implementation process,” Fowler said. He said DEEP has already received some funds from the award. 
Led by DEEP, Connecticut developed a multi-department Solar For All program it calls “Project SunBridge – Connecting Communities to a Solar Future.” Its priority is to provide solar power to multi-family affordable housing that results in an energy savings of at least 20%.
The biggest funding recipient would be the Connecticut Green Bank, which would get $43.05 million to generate loans, grants and other financing products. The EPA approved the plan and budget on January 15, 2025, just days before Trump took office.
The components of Connecticut’s plan include a revolving loan fund for solar systems, energy storage, and enabling upgrades for multifamily affordable housing through the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority. Among the Green Bank’s offerings would be a solar lease option for single-family homes, loan and lease options for multifamily affordable housing and grants for energy storage installed with solar along with other needed upgrades. There is also funding for a number of side components including technical assistance, workforce development, community support and engagement and customer outreach.
On June 24, 2025, DEEP issued a request for proposals for a technical assistance initiative and a request for comments. The original July 8 deadline was extended to July 18.
The Biden administration said last year, when the program winners were announced, that it would serve “over 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities” nationwide. And they said it would create “hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, saving $8 billion in energy costs for families, delivering cleaner air, and combating climate change.” 
The reported funding termination comes as part of administration action in the recently signed tax and spending legislation as well as several executive orders — which began the day Trump took office — designed to disincentivize renewable energy, including solar specifically, in favor of using more fossil fuels for power.
“If leaders in the Trump administration move forward with this unlawful attempt to strip critical funding from communities across the United States, we will see them in court,” Kym Meyer, litigation director of the Southern Environmental Law Center said in a statement on the group’s website. “We have already seen the immense good this program has done on the ground and we won’t let it be snatched away to score political points.”
DEEP has similar plans. “We hope that the EPA will not attempt to rescind funding for this important program,” Fowler said. “But should it do so, we will work closely with the Office of the Attorney General and the Governor’s Office to evaluate our options and determine the most appropriate next steps.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-earthlight-lattizori-scaled-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-07 10:56:12.521086

Mississippi is already feeling its effects with a delay in production at the Nissan plant in Canton. 
While President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” ended EV tax incentives it also freed up cash for companies to invest in domestic production. If national demand continues to slow what will this mean for Mississippi?

Katherine Lin
Electric vehicle demand slowed in the United States before EV tax incentives ended due to higher up front costs, limited ranges and lack of charging infrastructure. Despite embracing EV manufacturing, Mississippi has one of the lowest rates of EV ownership in the country. EVs make up 0.1% of the market share in Mississippi compared to 1.2% nationally according to data from the US Department of Energy. 
What do you think the future of EVs in Mississippi looks like? Let us know what you think at marketplace@mississippitoday.org.
EV Manufacturing 
Auto manufacturing is a major employer in Mississippi, with 15,000 employees according to the Mississippi Development Authority. Over the past few years, there has been an influx of investment in EV manufacturing in the state: 

Nissan announced a $500 million investment in its Canton plant to build EVs.
Mullen Automotive, now Bollinger Innovations, began producing commercial EVs in Tunica. 
Cummins Inc., Daimler Trucks & Buses and PACCAR planned to invest $1.9 billion in a new EV battery plant in Marshall County.

Nissan’s declining sales of EVs and other financial pressures led to the announcement that EV production would be pushed back at its Canton plant. Bollinger Innovations’s ongoing legal battles forced it to consolidate its operations and transfer ownership of a plant in Indiana. However, its Tunica plant continues to be operational.

In July, the Commercial Dispatch reported that Paccar was laying off an unspecified number of people at its Lowndes plant, which manufactures diesel engines. While the company announced that its net income was down from the previous year in Q2 2025, it exceeded industry expectations. There’s been no announcements that the company is stopping plans for a new facility in Lowndes and the battery plant in Marshall County. Paccar’s executives were optimistic about the second half of 2025 on a recent earnings call. 
One reason was changes to tax law in the new federal tax and spending bill that allows companies to deduct spending on domestic research and development, equipment and factories all at once instead of spread out over multiple years. The result, more cash for companies sooner.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Supreme Court put on hold a new state law that critics say threatens the independence of a constitutionally created board overseeing nearly $2 billion in public dollars.
The high court ruled Wednesday that the law that allows the appointing authorities of the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust board to remove members at will cannot take effect until further order of the court.
The law was set to take effect Aug. 28, but TSET challenged the constitutionality of House Bill 2783, which also limits governing board members to seven years.
Members currently serve staggered, seven-year terms and oversee the public endowment fund.
Oklahoma voters created TSET, an endowment trust, in 2000 through a constitutional amendment after 46 states sued tobacco companies. The companies paid the states damages for illnesses caused by smoking.

A new study found that hospitals are increasingly buying up private physician-owned practices, and costs for services are rising (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).As more hospitals have gobbled up private physician practices, costs for childbirth and other services have gone up, according to a new study.
Since the early aughts, the share of physicians in the United States working for hospitals has nearly doubled, according to the study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization.
And as fewer doctors work in physician-owned practices, patients or their insurers end up paying more, the study’s authors found.
For example: Two years after a hospital buys an OB-GYN practice, prices for labor and delivery jump an average of $475 and physician prices rise by $502, according to the study. Researchers focused on births, which are the most common reason for hospital admission among people with private insurance.
This rapid acquisition by hospitals is reshaping a U.S. industry once dominated by tens of thousands of small, physician-owned practices.
Only about 42% of U.S. physicians work in a physician-owned private practice, according to the most recent survey data from the American Medical Association. Nearly 47% work for hospitals, a sharp rise over the past several years. Most emergency room physicians are now employed by hospital systems or by private equity-owned staffing groups.
The new research offers further evidence for how hospital acquisitions of private practices “can result in anticompetitive price increases,” said Matthew Grennan, one of the study’s authors and an associate professor of economics at Emory University, in a news release.
“As a result, I think economists and others in the antitrust community are likely to give more careful consideration to these potential sources of harm,” he said.
Medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with about 14 million Americans owing more than $1,000 in medical debt, according to research nonprofit KFF.
These post-merger price increases are driven by reduced competition, Grennan and his fellow researchers found. Yet there’s been little effort by federal or state regulators to halt hospital mergers that could lead to higher prices for consumers.
But states have taken some steps toward lowering medical costs in recent years.
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in more than a dozen states have addressed so-called “facility fees,” which are charges that some hospitals tack on for patient visits to hospital-owned physician offices.
This year in Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers passed a bill requiring hospitals to make the cost of many of their services more transparent to patients so they’re aware of the costs. Providers can face penalties for noncompliance. A similar Oklahoma law authored by Democrats and passed last year requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients.
Some states have capped the rates hospitals or physicians can charge. Colorado sets provider and hospitals rates based on a specific formula if insurance plans aren’t able to lower peoples’ premiums to a certain level, while Montana and Oregon limited the amount hospitals and other providers can charge for their state employee health plan.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A leader of a government watchdog group says U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, had a conflict of interest when he voted to approve his son-in-law’s nomination to a federal job.
Thune voted yes Saturday on the confirmation of Luke Lindberg as undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Lindberg is married to one of Thune’s daughters, Brittany Thune Lindberg.
Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said U.S. Senate rules don’t overtly bar senators from voting on the confirmation of a family member. But the rules do bar members of Congress from using their office in a way that benefits family members.
“I don’t think you need to be an ethics expert to understand that there’s a conflict of interest here,” Sherman said.

Thune’s immediate predecessor as Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, also a Republican, faced a similar situation in 2017 when his wife, Elaine Chao, was nominated to lead the Department of Transportation. After initially saying he would not recuse himself from Chao’s confirmation vote, McConnell ultimately voted “present.”
Sherman said Thune’s vote would not have made the difference on Lindberg’s nomination — the vote was 78-17 in favor — and there was no reason not to follow McConnell’s example. Sherman said Thune’s actions set a bad precedent.
“It emboldens other people to bend the rules for themselves,” Sherman said. 
Lindberg served as chief of staff and chief strategy officer at the Export‑Import Bank during the prior Trump administration, and later helped launch and lead South Dakota Trade, a public‑private partnership in the state aimed at expanding export opportunities for businesses.
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins praised Lindberg in a news release about his confirmation.
“We are thrilled to have Luke join our team and I have full faith that his drive and deep experience will ensure we not only defend our producers, but also open new doors to global trade,” Rollins said.
Thune’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Delaware’s first weekend of legal recreational marijuana sales brought in more than $900,000 in combined adult-use and medical cannabis sales, according to state officials, marking a strong launch for the state’s newly opened market.
Between Friday and Sunday, the state reported $625,000 in adult-use sales alone, generating an estimated $93,750 in tax revenue.
The remainder came from ongoing medical marijuana purchases, which remain tax-exempt.
County-by-county breakdown
Sales were strongest in New Castle County, which saw $432,319.78 in total transactions across its five licensed dispensaries.
Sussex County also saw healthy numbers, reporting $242,832.64 in sales, followed by Kent County with $227,946.54.
Delaware currently has 14 dispensaries operating under both medical and recreational licenses, with more openings expected by the end of the summer.
Sales by marijuana form
The most popular product category by far was traditional cannabis flower, which accounted for more than half of all sales:

Usable Marijuana (flower): $509,042.59 – 56% of total sales
Marijuana Extract for Inhalation (vapes): $233,267.82 – 26% of sales
Solid Marijuana Infused Edibles: $123,768.00 – 14% of total sales

Other products:

Marijuana Mix Infused (pre-rolls with concentrate): $16,212.90
Liquid Marijuana Infused Edibles (tinctures, elixirs, capsules): $13,526.40
Marijuana Infused Topicals (lotions): $4,790.00
Miscellaneous Items: $1,362.73
Marijuana Mix Packaged (pre-rolls): $948.50
Hash (bubble hash): $180.00

Regulators conducted compliance checks throughout the weekend and reported no significant issues.

According to the Office of the Marijuana Commissioner Joshua Sanderlin, dispensaries followed state guidelines on customer verification, product tracking, and safety protocols.
“Delaware’s transition to adult-use cannabis sales has exceeded expectations,” Sanderlin said. “More than $900,000 in sales over the first three days reflects not only strong consumer demand, but also the readiness and professionalism of our licensed operators to serve the public safely and responsibly.”
Economic outlook
With a 15% tax rate on adult-use cannabis, the state expects recreational marijuana to become a steady source of revenue to fund public health programs, regulatory enforcement, and social equity initiatives.
Medical marijuana, by contrast, remains untaxed.
“This successful launch positions Delaware to realize the economic benefits of regulated cannabis sales while maintaining our commitment to public safety and responsible implementation,” said Joshua Bushweller, secretary of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security.
Next steps for marijuana in the First State
Delaware has issued 64 conditional licenses so far, with plans to expand the market further in coming months.
The state also plans to begin distributing Social Equity Financial Assistance (SEFA) grants to help support cannabis entrepreneurs from historically disadvantaged communities.
Meanwhile, a full review of cannabis regulations is underway to ensure the program remains sustainable and accessible.
Delaware legalized medical marijuana in 2011.
The adult-use program was approved by the General Assembly in 2023 and officially launched on Aug. 1.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/weed-jpeg.jpg,,,2025-08-07 10:56:12.521086

When she decided to seek a new nursing job, she learned her license lapsed and that she was under investigation for working in nursing without a license. She asked Kansas House members to bring order to the Kansas State Board of Nursing. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Legislature's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — A contingent of mostly Kansas House Republicans launched an aggressive inquiry into the Kansas State Board of Nursing’s handling of licensure cases that prompted demands for firing state employees, halting coercive tactics, overhauling rules and regulations, and defunding the agency.
Cases brought to the attention of the House Select Committee on Government Oversight included the saga of a 32-year nurse practitioner who was pressured to sign a consent order declaring she was guilty of “unprofessional conduct” for accidently letting her license lapse while taking time off to care for her cancer-stricken husband. She said the ongoing investigation has left her unemployable.
Another involved an advanced practice registered nurse who was placed under investigation and blocked from issuing prescriptions for checking the wrong box on her online license renewal form. The inquiry wrecked her business and compromised care of her patients.
Augusta Rep. Kristey Williams, the Republican chair of the House committee, repeatedly challenged Board of Nursing leaders to answer a plain question: “Is that justice?”
Andrea Watson, the Board of Nursing president and a member of the volunteer board since 2018, came the closest to answering whether mistakes had been made adjudicating the few cases brought to the committee’s attention.
“We can always second-guess what happens,” she said. “I think there could have been different decisions made.”
Response to hours of questions directed at Carol Moreland, executive administrator of the Board of Nursing; assistant attorney general Rachel Kenney, who is assigned to the Board of Nursing; Adrian Guerrero, director of operations for the Board of Nursing, and Watson appeared to fuel frustration among legislators. The nursing board has responsibility for more than 70,000 licensees.
“It actually really does hurt me to hear that people here had bad experiences, because that is never the intent of our agency,” said Guerrero, who argued the agency was understaffed and sidestepped a question about whether mistakes were made. “I’m not sure I’m in the position to make that sort of determination for the board.”
Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican, grew agitated as Board of Nursing officials sounded as if they were deflecting accountability for issues raised by lawmakers. Tarwater vowed to be heard on the subject when the 2026 Legislature convened in January.
“This is the most frustrating meeting I think I’ve ever been in,” Tarwater said. “I can’t wait until for … whenever we get sworn in, because I’m going to unfund this board. I fear this is just the tip of the iceberg. Can we fire people? Because people have to be fired over this. You are destroying peoples’ lives.”
Rep. Barbara Ballard, D-Lawrence, demanded to know who at the Board of Nursing was responsible for deciding punishment of nurses.
“Where does the buck stop?” she asked.
Sitting a few feet away in the Capitol, Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, asserted the Board of Nursing had a practice of coercing nurses to sign career-damaging consent orders, for which there could be no appeal, to end investigations.
“I don’t think inadvertently letting your license lapse falls under unprofessional conduct,” said Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill. “Having that fall under a category with … sexual misconduct is abhorrent.”
 
October surprise
Kansas nurse practitioner Amy Siple put her professional career on idle in early 2024 to care for her husband after he was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. Her focus on needs of her spouse marked the first time in her 32-year career that she wasn’t employed in patient care.
After her husband’s surgery and progression toward recovery, Siple began considering returning to work as a nurse. In October, she checked the Board of Nursing’s website and discovered she inadvertently forgot to renew her license by a May deadline.
Siple submitted evidence her continuing education credits and malpractice insurance had been current at the time of the lapse. She paid the required license renewal fee, but didn’t anticipate the Board of Nursing’s response.
“I was asked to sign a consent agreement akin to a guilty plea for ‘unprofessional conduct,’ for practicing without a license,” Siple said. “This is in spite of the fact that no billing will be found under my National Provider Identifier number during this period.”
Siple said she was not sent a reminder of the deadline to renew her license, but the Board of Nursing said it had a practice of mailing renewal postcard reminders 90 days in advance. Despite Board of Nursing pressure to do so, Siple declined to sign the consent order. She hired an attorney to represent her for an appeal to the Board of Nursing.
She said the dispute could end with her name added to three databases reserved for nurses who engaged in unprofessional behavior. Its the kind of scarlet letter that remained on a person’s regulatory record even after death, she said.
“The draconian rules and regulations of the Kansas State Board of Nursing threaten my professional future,” Siple said. “KSBN intends to engage in a public shaming process. I would prefer to be punched in the gut than to be labeled as an unprofessional nurse.”
Moreland, the Board of Nursing’s executive administrator, said she couldn’t speak about Siple’s case because it was still pending.
“We typically don’t discuss those while they’re still active,” she said.
Tarwater, the legislator who raised the possibility of firings and defunding the Board of Nursing, said the agency should dismiss Siple’s case.
“Do you feel like you’re dangerous now or might put someone’s life in jeopardy because you forgot to renew your license for a couple months?” he asked Siple.
Siple said the only danger to the public was the manner in which the Board of Nursing administered regulations.
“Please discipline nurses who are a threat to public safety, but do not take out those of us who commit clerical errors,” she said. “Since this experience, I am unemployable.”
 
Double duty
Ana Ahrens, a psychiatric nurse practitioner and a licensed addiction counselor in Wichita, went online to renew her registered nurse license and the more specialized advanced practice registered nurse license in 2024. In the process, she accidently renewed her RN license twice. The Board of Nursing collected her duplicated fee payment, but didn’t inform her of the error.
“You can imagine how shocked I was when I was notified Feb. 6, 2025, by a phone call from a pharmacist that he could not fill the prescriptions I had written for my patient because my license was not active,” Ahrens said.
She stopped seeing patients and ordering prescriptions. She contacted the Board of Nursing to redo the RN and APRN license applications and paid both fees a second time. A few weeks later, she said, the Board of Nursing sent a letter saying she was being investigated for practicing without a license.
“I was informed by my attorney that if I reached out to any legislator, KSBN would retaliate against me,” Ahrens said. “During the investigation, I was told to sign a consent agreement admitting to unprofessional conduct or I would face consequences.”
She signed the document and the Board of Nursing added her name to the state database and two national databases identifying nurses who engaged in unprofessional behavior. She said it felt like the Board of Nursing “used tyranny as a form of punishment.”
“KSBN said they were protecting the public from me. In reality, they harmed my patients,” she said.
 
A reform agenda
Rep. Sandy Pickert, a Wichita Republican and retired registered nurse, said it was odd the Board of Nursing took a harsh approach in licensing cases during a period in which Kansas was desperate for additional nursing professionals. For example, the state hospitals in Larned and Osawatomie spend about $50 million annually to hire contract nurses to fill gaps.
Pickert said she voted for bills to provide scholarships and other incentives for education of licensed practical nurses, registered nurses and other health workers.
“At the same time,” she said, “we’re at risk of decreasing patient access to care by losing experienced nurses by extreme punitive measures for minor nonclinical-related infractions.”
Pickert recommended the Legislature review the Board of Nursing’s policies and procedures for inconsistencies in implementation. The Board of Nursing should enact a policy to address clerical errors in licensing applications and to require contacting of nurses when mistakes were discovered, she said.
Penalties for nurses had to be commensurate with the gravity of the error in licensing, Pickert said.
“Stop coercion to sign a consent agreement with admission of unprofessional conduct for clerical errors,” she said.
She said nurses reported to the three databases for clerical errors in licensing should be removed from those registers and given a written apology.
In addition, she said, the state ought to provide restitution to nurses who suffered monetary damages as a result of licensing errors, including loss of employment and escalation of malpractice insurance rates.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Amy-Siple-nurse-defendant-2b-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-08-07 10:56:12.521086

On one of her two purple phones, Livonia City Clerk Lori Miller has a sticker that proudly proclaims “I  Boring Elections.”
And on Tuesday, that’s just what she got. Elections in her city and across the state were uneventful, a welcome gift to clerks who are bracing for a busy 2026.
Miller used the primary in Livonia, a Detroit suburb in Wayne County, as an opportunity to test out some upgrades ahead of a competitive city council race in November and next year’s elections for the U.S. House and Senate, state legislative seats, governor, and other statewide offices.
“We’re trying a lot of things,” Miller told Votebeat as she helped to close out absent voter counting boards at the end of the night. “I didn’t want to do them last year, with so many other things happening, and I want to be ready for next year.”
Miller is relatively new to the job — her first general election as clerk was last year’s presidential contest. She said she’s focused on improving processes and ensuring elections run smoothly. That includes steps like consolidating precincts, allowed under a state law that reflects voters’ increased interest in absentee and early voting, and reorganizing the way absentee ballots are stored, allowing counting boards to finish sooner.
And, for the most part, it worked.
The precinct consolidation did confuse some voters who’d voted for years at a different polling location or precinct number. The city posted signs outside each polling place, but some voters still wondered if they were at the right place.
“We’ve voted at the same place for 30 years,” Natalie Shields, a Livonia voter, told Votebeat after casting her ballot at a new precinct housed at Riley Upper Elementary School. “Now we have a new number, a new place — it’s just frustrating to try to figure this all out.”
Despite these short-term impacts, Miller said there were plenty of reasons for the change: It will save money in the long term by allowing her to maintain fewer machines and bring on fewer workers for smaller elections. It can be difficult to find people prepared to work shifts that easily stretch past 14 hours.
It’s also given her leverage to push for higher pay for election workers to make the job more appealing. That proposal is still moving through the city’s budget process.
The city sent out cards to voters with their new precincts and voting locations, and posted signs that said which old precincts became which new ones. Even so, poll workers said, nearly every voter they spoke to questioned if they were at the right place. Some were sent to other locations, but most were able to cast their ballots as expected.
Whatever confusion resulted didn’t appear to diminish turnout. The city of 95,000 has just under 75,000 registered voters, and 27,571 of them cast ballots in Tuesday’s election — or about 37%. That’s high for an August election, bolstered by a huge slate of 17 candidates running for city council and a contentious bond proposal to fund new city buildings. By comparison, in Detroit — where voters were picking out candidates for the first open mayoral race in more than a decade — fewer than 17% of registered voters cast ballots in Tuesday’s election.
More than 9,000 Livonia voters turned out to vote in person, leading to a steady stream of voters at nearly every polling place all day. The rest of the city’s voters cast their ballots either early or absentee. About a third of the city’s registered voters received mailed absentee ballots. That was one reason she felt confident consolidating precincts: Most voters now take advantage of expanded early voting and the right to no-excuse absentee voting, both enshrined in the state’s constitution through voter referendums in 2018 and 2022.
“People like those options,” Miller said. “My job is to make sure they’re able to use them.”
But that’s not her only job, especially on Election Day. She spent the day shuttling between polling places, troubleshooting minor problems that arose and ensuring that voter assist terminals — designed for voters with disabilities but open for anyone to use — were set up properly. Once the polls closed, she changed out of her red “Livonia City Clerk’s Office” shirt into a navy blue blouse and went live on Facebook, YouTube, and local TV, a Livonia tradition, to quickly share results with the public.
Back at City Hall, the counting of absentee ballots went on all day. Starting as early as 7 a.m., four teams of half a dozen people or more counted continually at tables on the top floor. With more than 17,000 ballots coming in early, Miller’s team needed a better system to sort and process them. Enter a new idea, borrowed from fellow clerks in neighboring downriver communities (who in turn borrowed it from a clerk in tiny Houghton County in the Upper Peninsula): Sort ballots by the date they’re received, not by precinct.
It allowed them to better count each day’s results, leading to smoother final tallies and much faster paperwork.
So on Tuesday, in a conference room decorated with posters that depicted city officials as movie stars — City Emergency Preparedness Director Brian Kahn featured in a “Wrath of Kahn” mockup, for instance — the city’s four absentee voter counting boards gave it go.
It worked: All four boards completed their counts before midnight. The city was able to report complete unofficial results just after midnight.
“We learned a lot here tonight,” Miller said, standing beneath her face superimposed on a poster for the 2014 football film “Draft Day,” instead reading “Election Day.” “We’ll do it all again next time.”

Bill Elam, R-Nikiski. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)On Saturday afternoon, after Alaska lawmakers voted to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of $50.6 million in public school funding, the leaders of the House and Senate’s majority caucuses gathered in the Senate President’s office and cheered.
For the 10 members of the House and Senate minority caucuses who were crucial to that override, there was no cheering and no post-vote news conference. 
They quietly packed up and left the Capitol later that weekend without fanfare. 
But without them, there would have been no override.
In Alaska, it takes votes from at least 45 of 60 state lawmakers to override a governor’s veto of an appropriations issue, the highest threshold in the country. That means almost any veto override — even in years when one party dominates the House, Senate or both — requires the approval of at least some lawmakers in a minority caucus.
This year, that approval wasn’t easy to get. Both the House minority and Senate minority caucuses are made up of Republicans who are conservative enough to be unwilling to join Democrats, independents and more moderate Republicans in the House and Senate majority caucuses.
Public polling ahead of the vote showed only 35% of registered Republicans supported an override, compared to 65% of independents and 91% of Democrats. On social media, Republican campaign groups vowed to challenge any Republican who voted in favor of the override.
But for 10 minority lawmakers, the views of their individual districts, stretching from the Kenai Peninsula to Fairbanks, mattered more than aligning with Gov. Dunleavy. 
In the Senate, Mike Cronk of Tok, James Kaufman of Anchorage and Robert Yundt of Wasilla voted to override alongside members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority.
Among members of the House minority, yes votes came from Jeremy Bynum of Ketchikan, Julie Coulombe of Anchorage, Bill Elam of Nikiski, David Nelson of Anchorage, Justin Ruffridge of Soldotna, Dan Saddler of Eagle River and Will Stapp of Anchorage.
In post-vote interviews, nine of the 10 minority lawmakers offered varying reasons for their vote. (The 10th, Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, did not return calls and texts seeking comment.)
For many of the minority lawmakers who voted yes on this year’s override, it was the culmination of years of negotiations, they said.
Last year, legislators voted to increase the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-pupil funding formula, but Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed that bill and lawmakers sustained that veto when members of the minority flipped their prior support.
Instead of a permanent fix, legislators voted to approve a one-time funding bonus equivalent to a $680 BSA increase. 
This year was different. Lawmakers approved a permanent $700 BSA increase, plus some policies preferred by Republicans. Dunleavy partially vetoed funding for that increase, but last week’s override canceled that decision, leaving schools with a small year-over-year funding increase.
That small bump to the budget meant it was palatable to lawmakers who had opposed larger increases. In addition, this year’s bill increasing the BSA included policy changes, including an adjustable cap on class sizes and an optional ban on students’ cellphones. That offered additional enticements for reluctant Republicans.
Several of the members of the minority who voted to override on Saturday said that while they didn’t support a funding increase, it was worth it in order to unlock policy changes that they support, particularly because there didn’t appear to be enough votes to take up changes that Dunleavy had proposed.
Rep. Jeremy Bynum, R-Ketchikan, House District 1
Ahead of Saturday’s vote, Bynum said he would vote to override because if lawmakers failed to override the governor, the decision to raise the base student allocation means raising the maximum contribution that local governments can provide to their districts.
If legislators didn’t restore the funding, local governments would simply increase their local contribution, he said, putting more of the cost of public schools on local taxpayers, rather than sharing the cost across the state.
Rep. Julie Colombe, R-Anchorage, House District 11
“I don’t want one-time funding anymore. The problem is, the way it’s been put out is that this was just some random $200 BSA veto. It wasn’t. It was connected to 19 sections of policy in HB 57 that, to me, was significant,” she said, referring to education policy items that were also vetoed by the governor and overridden earlier in the year. 
“I didn’t override SB 140 because I wasn’t really a part of putting that together. It was like a half-page bill. It didn’t have much policy at all. So I didn’t go all the way with that one. I sustained two vetoes because it was, to me, just funding. But HB 57 has a lot of policy, and that’s what I want, and that’s what I’ve always told my constituents is what I need — is funding and policy, and I need both, and I need it meaningful. 
For me and my district, class sizes are a big problem. And so when I got the class cap in there directing districts to have to have their own class cap policy. They have to tell parents how many kids are in the seats, not a (pupil to teacher ratio) class size. That was really significant for me. And so if I’m pushing for that, that’s going to take some more money. And I just didn’t see why would I cut the funding when I’m trying to get my class sizes down?”
Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok, Senate District R
“I represent nine different school districts. Fairbanks is my urban school district, and we were asking for accountability. And you look at what Fairbanks has done — they’ve done the work, hard work. They’ve closed seven schools, outsourced their custodians, cut their admin in half. And, I mean, what more do you ask? We all want better outcomes, and I believe we can get there, but you can’t just starve them to death while they make the right moves to downsize and expect them to be successful,” he said. 
The school districts in Cronk’s Senate district include homeschool correspondence programs that cover a majority of the homeschooled students in the state, and he has two boarding schools in his district.
“Costs have gone up. It’s hard to keep those things going. Yes, they’re remote — Nenana’s on a road, but Galena is not — but those schools are invaluable for our kids that decide to go to a boarding school,” he said.
“Was it fun to vote against our governor? No, and it wouldn’t have been fun if he was a Democrat governor or she was a Democrat. It wouldn’t be fun either way. But I have to do it. I feel it is right. I’ve seen the school districts do the work. I’ve seen good things they’re doing. And I want to make sure people know that I am not one of those people that come out there and say, ‘Wow, we rank 51st out of 53 (states, districts and territories), our kids are dumb.’ We produce some really awesome kids in our schools. Our schools are doing good things. We do need to do things better. But, you know, starving them to death doesn’t do that for us.”
Rep. Bill Elam, R-Nikiski, House District 8
Elam declined significant comment but said that he had given his word on voting for House Bill 57, the education funding bill, and wanted to stand by that word. Stability is important to him, he said, including stable funding for schools in his district that will allow districts to budget better in the future.
Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, Senate District F
“In the end, for me, this was essentially the same money that was in the budget the last time — we had the $680 (BSA) in there. And this was just a little bit more, when you roll it all up. And unlike last year, there was actually some beneficial policy in there. And I just didn’t think we could kick the can down the road, to use that overused phrase. We were at an impasse,” he said. 
“I think it’s important for people to remember the much higher dollar figures that were floating around for a time. And what we landed on ended up being much closer to the additional money that was put in last year’s enacted budget. So all those things considered, with the school districts saying that they can’t improve if they don’t have the funding, so let’s stabilize on what we funded them at essentially last year — with these additional tweaks and with the policy that we can get in it — and let’s go for it. Back when I voted for the bill, I said, ‘well, if I vote for the bill, I’ll go all the way with it.’ I have a hard time — if I support something once — with not supporting it, unless there’s new information or new reasons not to do so.”
Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, House District 7
“I have historically taken the position of my ‘yeas’ being ‘yeas’ and my ‘nays’ being ‘nays.’ I voted for HB 57 at both opportunities. And I think that it’s the right thing to do from the perspective of the folks on the Kenai,” he said 
“I heard from many, many, many (of my constituents) that said, ‘stay on the right track.’ So, you know, I think it’s a difficult thing to do at the end of the day. You don’t ever get into office with the intention of taking those types of votes. But I feel like it was about keeping a commitment, following the budget that we had already passed. And I think we really had to move away from this idea of one-time funding, which I think is really an irresponsible way of funding schools, and get back to stability, I think can help.”
Rep. Dan Saddler, R-Eagle River, District 24
“As I tell my constituents who are happy with me and those who are upset with me, I wanted to get education reform and understood that the price of the compromise to achieve that was some increase in funding. While I did not get anywhere near the reform I wanted, I know the education advocates didn’t get anywhere near the money they wanted,” he said. 
“The legislative process is about getting wins where you can and the best deal you can, so I thought that the bill we had was the best we could do given the lineup of the Legislature at this point, and I did not want to flip my position when it became a matter of the degree to which the funding was increased. 
“And so it’s my hope that we can continue to get better results through policy reform, but I understand the need for some education funding as well. So in short, this was the best deal we could come up with. So we make the deal, stick with it, and move on and try and do more later.”
Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, House District 32
“I think education is important. And I think Alaska’s education system certainly needs reform. But I can speak to my school district in Fairbanks and our school board president and our board in general, they have done the vast majority of things that they have been asked to do.
They’ve been asked to reduce admin. Well, they cut admin by 50%. 
They’ve been asked to consolidate schools. They consolidated several schools. 
They looked for outsourcing. They let go of the custodians, and now they outsource that to contracting,” he said.
“I fundamentally believe that there’s a balance between funding and reform, and when you ask people to do things, especially when there are hard things — and hard things are often unpopular — you should support people when they do hard things that you ask them to do that were necessary.
I just feel like it would be not supporting my values if I didn’t vote the way I did or articulate the way I did. …”
“Yes, it’s a particularly tough vote, and I’ll explain why. This kind of sounds a little weird, but I’m a lifelong Republican. I’ve been active in Republican politics my entire time in Alaska. I’ve supported campaigns, locally, statewide, legislatively, for the better part of 15 years. And the last thing that I really want to do is contradict my own governor. …
I believe it’s the right thing, and time will tell, but I will say, on a personal level, the last thing I ever thought I would do would be to override a Republican governor. It’s just a weird moment. I mean, you have all these people celebrating. I have not celebrated.”
Sen. Robert Yundt, R-Wasilla, Senate District N
“The point I would like to make is I’ve changed the paradigm. There will be no more one-time money. You will not see Republicans (vote for that). I’ve killed that. I don’t run a business that way. Northrim Bank would put me out of business if I behaved that way one time. Money was different every year, and you didn’t know what you were getting until you got it. That is a failed business model,” he said.
“This is only 0.3% more than there was put into education last year, and we got a ton of great policies for it, and I appreciate everybody working together as a team to get it, to get us there.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250802-Saddler-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-07 10:56:12.521086

NEW CASTLE — Faithful Friends Animal Society is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, marking a major milestone in its mission to care for homeless pets across Delaware.
The nonprofit, which moved into its new state-of-the-art shelter just last year, says the expanded space has dramatically improved conditions for both animals and staff. But this summer, the organization is facing its toughest challenge yet.
Despite the improved facility, the shelter is currently filled beyond capacity. Faithful Friends is caring for 346 cats—116 of them kittens—along with 70 dogs, some of which are being temporarily housed in office spaces due to a lack of available kennels.
The shelter’s critter room is also overflowing, requiring additional cages to accommodate a surge in guinea pigs and rabbits.
“Summer is our most challenging season,” said Jane Pierantozzi, executive director. “We are crowded. Adoptions slow down due to vacations, but the number of animals needing refuge skyrockets.”

The shelter attributes the spike in abandoned pets to rising housing costs and inflation, which are making it harder for families to care for their animals.
This crisis follows a difficult year for Faithful Friends. In 2024, the shelter battled a serious virus outbreak in its dog department. Community donations helped them recover, and the organization is once again turning to the public for support.
Faithful Friends has set an ambitious fundraising goal for August, with $125,000 still needed through its Annual Appeal and Medical Fund to continue its lifesaving work.

(Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Wednesday marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act being signed into law. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court started a timer on what some fear could be the demise of key provisions of the landmark civil rights legislation.
Justices signaled last week they intend to consider whether a state violates the U.S. Constitution when it seeks to remedy a violation of the Voting Rights Act by taking race into account during the redistricting process.
The court issued an order Friday to parties in Louisiana v. Callais, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed against the state over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House of Representatives. They are being asked to explain whether the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
“It’s an ominous question,” said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive organization that follows redistricting issues throughout the country.
The 14th and 15th amendments gave formerly enslaved people the right to vote and prohibit any discrimination that keeps a person from voting. The Voting Rights Act, which was approved in 1965, bolsters the protections granted in those amendments.
At question in the Callais case is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.
Bringing the Voting Rights Act into question makes the case among the most important the court will rule on in its upcoming term. The decision could have nationwide implications, as it could set the standard for the degree to which race can be considered when drawing election maps after each decennial census.
A decision on Callais  — and on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act — will not come until next spring. The process that put the case before conservative-majority court started years ago.

FEBRUARY 2022: During an 18-day special session on redistricting, Louisiana lawmakers passed laws that redrew the borders of Louisiana’s six U.S. House seats and its legislative districts.
The Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus advocated for maps that increased the number of majority Black districts.
“One-third of six is two” became the rallying cry of Black lawmakers, who believed that since Black people made up nearly a third of the state’s population, they should be represented by one-third of Louisiana’s congressional districts.
Republicans, who held the majority in the legislature, declined to increase Black representation, opening themselves up to litigation.
MARCH 9, 2022 – Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the congressional map Republicans supported. He said the boundaries, which kept just one district majority Black, violated the Voting Rights Act.
MARCH 30, 2022 – Lawmakers convened a one-day special session to override Edwards’ veto.
Hours later, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Black Louisiana voters filed a lawsuit, Robinson v. Ardoin, challenging the map, claiming it violated federal law.
JUNE 6, 2022 – U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick sided with the Black Robinson plaintiffs, ruling the map an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Dick was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2012. Her ruling required the legislature to draw a new map with two majority Black districts that could be used in the 2022 congressional midterm election while litigation continued.
JUNE 2022 – The Louisiana Legislature met for another special session to create a map to comply with the judge’s guidance. In defiance of the federal court order, lawmakers adjourned without approving new congressional districts.
Several days later, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Louisiana’s request to block Dick’s ruling, pending the outcome of a similar redistricting case from Alabama, Allen v. Milligan. The court’s order meant the map Republicans passed in February would remain in place for the 2022 congressional midterms, despite a lower court ruling that it violated the Voting Rights Act and was racially discriminatory.
JUNE 8, 2023 – On the final day of Louisiana’s 2023 legislative session, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a ruling in Allen v. Milligan. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court’s three liberal members in an opinion that Alabama’s map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
The court’s decision put a charge into the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus and Black voters, as Louisiana’s case was mathematically stronger than Alabama’s. Alabama has seven districts and a 26.8% Black population, while Louisiana has six districts and a 32.8% Black population.
“I’m ecstatic,” Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, said with a grin after learning of the news.
FALL 2023 – Republican U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was forced out of his position, setting up a power struggle for his replacement. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Jefferson was viewed as the natural successor, but a key McCarthy ally, U.S. Rep. Garret Graves of Baton Rouge, had other ideas. His role in the speaker drama was widely viewed as costing Scalise the speaker position, which ultimately went to U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport. Graves’ stance cost him support among Republicans in Washington, D.C., and back home.
At the same time, Graves bet on the wrong horse in the gubernatorial election, spurning the shoo-in winner, Attorney General Jeff Landry, for his college buddy, Stephen Waguespack, a business lobbyist. It put Graves at odds with an incoming governor who would exert more power than any other had in decades.
NOV. 11, 2023 – The conservative U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Louisiana Legislature violated the Voting Rights Act with its congressional map and set a Jan. 15, 2024, deadline for drawing a new version.
That deadline was tricky, as both the legislative leaders who fought for the map and the Democratic governor who vetoed it were weeks from leaving office. None had any desire to do the tedious work of redistricting in their final days in office.
Landry wouldn’t take office until Jan. 8, and the state constitution requires seven days lead time before a special session can convene. Lawmakers didn’t have enough time to pass a map before the deadline.
JAN. 15-19, 2024 – With a deadline extension from the federal court in hand, Gov. Jeff Landry convened the legislature for a special session. In just a week, lawmakers rammed through a new congressional map with two majority Black districts.
The session brought together a set of strange bedfellows: Black Democrats, who wanted more minority representation; and white Republicans, who used the opportunity to unseat Graves, who was short on allies and long on enemies.
To unseat Graves in the 6th Congressional District, Republicans had to draw a map that complied with fewer traditional redistricting principles than the one Black voters preferred. The Republican-crafted 6th District lines run from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing down the center of the state and veering to pick up clusters of Black voters along the way.
JAN. 30, 2024 – White voters filed the Callais lawsuit claiming the map was drawn solely based on race and discriminated against them.
APRIL 2024 – An appellate panel of three federal judges found the new district lines were illegal, though the map was allowed to be used for the 2024 election.
NOV. 4, 2024 – The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up an appeal from Black voters in the Callais lawsuit.
NOV. 5, 2024 – For the first time in decades, Black voters in Louisiana got the opportunity to elect two members of the state’s congressional delegation. U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields was elected to a third term in Congress. He previously represented the 4th Congressional District until 1997, when a federal court ruled its boundaries were an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
JUNE 2025 – In a rare move, U.S. Supreme Court punted a ruling on Callais, instead scheduling it for further arguments. At the time, justices did not say what new question it would raise.
Last week, the court made its question known, and the answer could reverberate across the country.
Li said the question posed by the court is so ominous because justices have questioned over the years whether there is a time limit to race-conscious redistricting practices. At the same time, he said, the court’s question is befuddling because time limits to Section Two are actually built into the Gingles Test.
Created by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1986 case Thornburg v. Gingles, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions to prove redistricting dilutes minority voting strength:

The racial or language minority group “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”
The minority group is politically cohesive
The majority votes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat the minority’s candidate of choice

“Section Two, by itself, automatically sunsets as conditions on the ground get better,” Li explained, referring to minorities’ access to equal voting opportunities.
The question is also troubling, experts say, because if the court’s ruling expands beyond Louisiana, it could be a further whittling down of the key civil rights legislation that has already been narrowed in recent years.
Civil rights proponents say that if the Supreme Court takes an ax to the Voting Rights Act with its ruling in the Callais case, it would be a reversal of its recent decisions.
John Bisognano, president of the National Redistricting Foundation, a voting rights organization, said courts have never ruled there is a conflict between the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court upheld Section 2 in its decision on Allen v. Milligan, the Alabama case that required a second majority-Black congressional district in the state.
“To comply with that law, Louisiana must have a congressional map that includes two Black opportunity districts,” Bisognano said in a statement. “If the Court decides to now undo that precedent, it would be a head-spinning reversal of itself.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.Progressive public defender-turned-prosecutor Mary Moriarty announced on Wednesday she won’t seek a second term as Hennepin County attorney but will focus on creating “enduring change” in the final 17 months of her term.
“We’ve become accustomed to elected officials who don’t deliver results and end up more invested in clinging to power than doing the work of the people. That is not me,” Moriarty said in a statement. “I want to focus on running the office, rather than running for office.”
Moriarty handily won election in 2022 by 16 percentage points against a tough-on-crime opponent, riding a wave of energy for criminal justice reform in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd.
Moriarty looked to transform an agency she spent decades fighting against as a public defender, promising to focus on rehabilitation over incarceration.
She largely delivered on that promise but became a lightning rod for frustrations with crime rates that, while in decline, remain elevated since the pandemic. She faced sharp criticism — even from some of her own supporters, at times — for seeking alternatives to prison even for heinous crimes.
Her decision to offer two juvenile brothers plea deals sparing them lengthy prison sentences for the murder of 23-year-old Zaria McKeever drew public outcry and a rebuke from progressive ally Attorney General Keith Ellison, who had endorsed her.
In a rare move, Gov. Tim Walz yanked the case from her office over her objections and assigned it to Ellison. He secured a 130-month prison sentence for one of the teens and a life sentence for the man who orchestrated the murder.
Moriarty, who vowed to draw a hard line against police abuse, again invited controversy in charging state trooper Ryan Londregan with the murder of Ricky Cobb II despite her office’s own expert witness determining the use of force was justified. She paid more than half a million dollars in taxpayer funds to a private law firm to prosecute the case, only to drop the charge.
Moriarty, in a news release announcing her decision, boasted of her office’s successes in violent prevention like the Youth Auto Theft Early Intervention Initiative, which intercepts juveniles likely to steal cars and connects their families with resources like food assistance and mental health services.
Her office ran expungement clinics for people who completed their sentences and created the first “Conviction Integrity Unit” to review past cases for errors; her office supported the exonerations of Marvin Haynes and Edgar Barrientos-Quintana, who were serving life sentences for murders they did not commit.
She also touted her work fighting labor violations, having secured the first felony wage theft conviction in Minnesota.
Before running for Hennepin County attorney, Moriarty spent 31 years as a public defender. She rose through the ranks to head the Hennepin County public defender’s office, but was ousted in 2020 over allegations she shared offensive social media posts and created a fearful work environment. Moriarty and her supporters say was targeted for her racial justice advocacy, and she was awarded a $300,000 settlement.
She said she believes voters will elect a successor who shares her progressive vision. Indeed, Rep. Cedrick Frazier, a labor lawyer and former public defender, announced he was considering running to replace Moriarty.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/P1081617-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-08-07 09:56:28.656688

Let’s dive into some education news:

Learning behind bars: Providing an education is one of the best ways prisons can lower recidivism rates. But the lengths facilities go to in order to reduce safety risks can also undermine incarcerated students’ educational opportunities. Some states ban inmates from using almost all technology and limit their internet access. To expand prison education, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation purchased access to EBSCO, an online research database. Students studying in prisons through California college programs are also getting access to research databases through the colleges’ existing licenses. Read more from CalMatters’ Tara García Mathewson.


Restricting immigrants in K-12 schools: More than 40 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling guaranteeing all students, no matter their immigration status, the right to a free K-12 public education. But experts warn that President Donald Trump’s administration could move to overturn that ruling and direct states to charge immigrant families tuition — even if their children are U.S. citizens. If that happens, it would have an outsized effect on California, where nearly half of the state’s children have at least one immigrant parent. Read more from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.


Frozen UCLA grants: A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration’s legal team to explain why the administration’s suspension of 300 UCLA grants by the National Science Foundation last week does not violate an earlier preliminary injunction issued by the judge. This order, given in June, directed the foundation to reinstate grants it had tried to terminate in the spring, and prohibited the foundation from terminating additional grants. Tuesday’s order is a response to what is considered the first legal challenge by UC professors to the science foundation’s recent suspension of the UCLA grants, which puts on hold about $170 million in funding.

Proposed energy market fuels concern

After advancing through the state Senate in June, the Assembly is considering legislation that would create a novel power market system among Western states that could lead to lower electric bills for Californians. But critics say it could also leave the state vulnerable to Trump’s push for more coal dependency, write CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo and Jeanne Kuang. 
Backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the proposal would enable California to trade electricity more freely with several other states. Proponents say a regional market would increase the usage of renewable energy, make California’s own grid more stable and prepare the state more readily for extreme weather.
But bill opponents argue that the risks outweigh the benefits. Some of the potential states that could be included in the new power market rely on coal for energy, such as Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico. Given Trump’s past actions to dismantle federal and state environmental protections, creating and joining a regional market could expose the state to federal rules that call for more fossil fuels in the energy market.

Minimum wage will go up on January

Beginning Jan. 1, California’s current hourly minimum wage of $16.50 will go up to $16.90, a 2.49% increase. The state’s department of finance released the new wage amount last week, which is adjusted annually for inflation and based on the national consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers.
Some cities and counties set higher minimum wages than the state — particularly those in coastal regions — and California fast food workers and some health care workers have a different wage standard.
Most low-wage workers in California are either under the age of 25 or over 50, with about 10% serving as the sole breadwinners for their households with children. A living wage in California in 2025 is $28.72 for an adult with no children, and $27.84 for two working adults with a child, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s living wage calculator.

Supreme Court campaign from lobbyist Harold Brubaker, a former speaker of the North Carolina House. (Photo: NCGA)A $6,800 donation from a longtime lobbyist to Rep. Sarah Stevens’ campaign for North Carolina Supreme Court appears to violate a state law that bars lobbyists from contributing to sitting legislators — regardless of the office they are running for.
The contribution came from Harold Brubaker, a registered lobbyist and a former speaker of the North Carolina House, who served more than 30 years in the legislature before becoming one of Raleigh’s most influential lobbyists. Brubaker donated to “Stevens for Justice,” the judicial campaign committee for Stevens, a Republican from Surry County who currently serves in the North Carolina House and is seeking a seat on the state’s highest court in 2026. The donation was made on June 23.
While judicial candidates may legally accept contributions from lobbyists, North Carolina law prohibits lobbyists from donating to any legislator while that individual is serving in that office. 
That prohibition extends to all campaign committees associated with the officeholder, including committees for different elections. The intent is to prevent lobbyists from influencing sitting lawmakers through campaign cash — regardless of what future political plans those legislators may have. 
Brubaker’s donation, made in the first half of 2025 and disclosed in the “Stevens for Justice” mid-year campaign finance report, appears to run afoul of that restriction. 
Brubaker told NC Newsline that the donation is “legal” before hanging up on a reporter.
Stevens said Brubaker “knows lobbyists can’t give to members during session,” but said his contribution was for her judicial campaign, not her legislative one. She added, “He did not give to me as a member. He gave to me as a judicial candidate.”
North Carolina State Board of Elections didn’t respond to a request for comment.
But under the statute, registered lobbyists are prohibited from contributing to legislators or candidates for the General Assembly during active session, even if that legislator is running for a different office. The Legislature was still in session on June 23 when the donation was made. The law contains narrow exceptions, such as a lobbyist contributing to their own campaign, but none apply to this situation.
“Unless Brubaker resigned as a lobbyist before June 23, it looks very much like an illegal contribution,” said Bob Hall, longtime campaign finance watchdog and former executive director of Democracy North Carolina. “It’s a $6,800 contribution, regulated by state law, to a North Carolina candidate’s committee from a registered lobbyist to a sitting state legislator.”
Brubaker was still a registered lobbyist as of June 23.
“It would be different if this was a contribution to a federal candidate’s committee that is not regulated by state law — which happened last year when several lobbyists got away with donating to Tim Moore’s congressional campaign while they were lobbying him as Speaker of the House,” Hall added. 
Stevens, who has served in the House since 2009, was elected Speaker Pro Tempore in 2017. She announced her bid for the state Supreme Court in May. The $6,800 Brubaker contribution matches the maximum allowed from an individual donor under current state limits. 
Stevens has reported raising about $141,000 since announcing her run in May, according to campaign finance reports. Among her donors are Macon Newby, wife of Republican Chief Justice Paul Newby, and Brent Barringer, husband of Republican Justice Tamara Barringer. Newby gave $3,800, while Barringer gave the maximum $6,800.


Steven’s challenger, North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls, has raised four times as much with a four-month fundraising head start. Earls, a Democrat and the court’s senior associate justice, reported raising more than $580,000 for the first six months of the year.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stevens5072025.jpg,,,2025-08-07 09:56:28.656688

At its inaugural meeting Tuesday, a board tasked with finding candidates to head up New Mexico’s newly created Office of the Child Advocate opted out of a state transparency law, citing privacy concerns for applicants.
The decision went against advice at the meeting from a representative of the New Mexico Department of Justice, and provoked criticism from the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government.
Passed in the most recent legislative session, House Bill 5 established the independent Office of the Child Advocate, along with a selection committee to establish a pool of candidates for the governor’s final appointment for a six-year term as the state’s child advocate. 
The law requires the child advocate to be an attorney, licensed social worker or psychologist with at least five years of experience in child welfare or juvenile justice. 
The duties of the office will include responding and investigating complaints on behalf of children in state custody or families interacting with the state’s Child Youth and Families Department. The office is administratively attached to the New Mexico Department of Justice.
CYFD has faced increased scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates over rising costs of settlements for maltreatment and deaths of children in custody from years past, as well as the housing of children in offices, which have included incidents of injury from private security guards. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in April announced an investigation into a 16-year old foster child’s suicide.

Proponents hailed the new office as a measure of oversight for the beleaguered agency and protection for children in state custody. At the same time, the proposal for an independent child advocate office garnered criticism from national independent monitors overseeing the implementation of reforms, following a 2019 settlement with the state agency and foster youth. CYFD Secretary Teresa Casados also warned the bill would prevent continued progress in the court-manded orders.

Meetings and motions
At its inaugural meeting Tuesday, the selection committee spent three hours on an agenda that included administrative business such as establishing a timeline for vetting candidates and laying the groundwork for future meetings. Members unanimously approved Rep. Michelle Paulene Abeyta (D-To’hajiilee) as the chair. 
However, the bulk of the meeting focused on whether the committee would adopt the policies and procedures of the New Mexico Open Meetings Act, which sets rules for posting and hosting meetings; parameters for public input; bars discussion of public business outside of meetings; and lists out the reasons meetings can be held behind closed doors. 
Members of the committee asked if portions of the interviews with candidates for the child advocate could be exempted from open meetings out of concerns that applicants might not want their current employers to know they were looking for new work or might have personal experiences in the foster care system they wanted to keep private.
Billy Jimenez, chief of civil affairs at NMDOJ, told committee members their meetings could not be closed for candidates interviewing for public jobs. He further said all resumes and applications would remain accessible under public records laws.
Committee member Albuquerque Judge Alma Roberson asked if the committee could agree to post meetings and keep public comment, but also hold meetings with candidates behind closed doors as necessary. 
Isabel Lopez, an NMDOJ attorney advising the committee, said if the committee adopted OMA  it would have to abide by its specific exemptions: “If it’s not in statute, you can’t make one up,” she said. Lopez advised the committee to adopt the Open Meetings Act, rather than simply include a transparency statement in its bylaws as some suggested.
“Committees created by statute should follow the Open Meetings Act as the Legislature carved out, made the intentional decision, to carve them out separate from a public body,” Lopez said, adding that the information was in NMDOJ’s published compliance guide. 
Nonetheless, the board members in attendance voted unanimously to decline adopting the Open Meetings Act.
“I move that we not follow the Open Meetings Act, but that we commit to encouraging public comments, ensuring that our meeting times and locations are made public and encourage transparency,” Roberson said.
New Mexico Foundation for Open Government Legal Director Amanda Lavin told Source NM it appears the committee is subject to OMA.
“The attorney general’s guidance on this is pretty clear,” Lavin said. “A statutorily-created committee is subject to OMA and doesn’t get to pick and choose which portions of the law to follow.”
NMFOG Executive Director Christine Barber told Source NM the law ensures safeguards for conducting public business, and said she’d urge the committee to reconsider and opt back in to open meetings rules.
“The best intentions are going to fall by the wayside really quickly, because it comes up against convenience,” Barber told Source NM. “I know that they will try very hard to police themselves, we have just never seen it work successfully.”
Maralyn Beck, the executive director and founder of nonprofit New Mexico Child First Network,  noted several times during the committee’s meeting that she had received an award from FOG for her public records work around CYFD. However she told Source NM in a call Wednesday that she felt the board struck the right balance by opting out of the Open Meetings Act.
“We should have confidence in the process. And if we’re going to root-canal single-handedly the most broken and corrupt state agency in New Mexico’s history, I feel like we’re airing on the side of transparency while also being cognizant of confidentiality issues,” Beck said. “The opposite of what our intentions are is secrecy. But there is a value if the best candidate we have is the biggest whistleblower at CYFD and they are afraid of applying for this job to improve the system and losing their job at CYFD.”
Beck said a case over the weekend with an Albuquerque mother charged with death of a 1-year-old, is emblematic of a “department in crisis,” and that it’s more important than ever to find the best candidate to helm the child advocate’s office. 
In response to Source NM’s inquiry regarding the child’s death, CYFD spokesperson Jessica Preston issued a statement Wednesday evening that the child had not been in the state’s custody. In a second, updated statement issued Wednesday night, Preston wrote that two of the three siblings were previously released into CYFD custody and were reinstated into the parents’ custody on July 21, following the dismissal of abuse and neglect charges. 
“The death of this child is a tragedy of immeasurable proportions. This outcome could not have been predicted by any of the parties involved in this case,” Preston said in the statement. “CYFD extends its deepest condolences to all those affected by this loss.”
Beck also told Source NM that she has “whistleblowers coming to me every freaking day because they are afraid…if they tell their supervisor of a concern, they will be fired. Children die when employees are afraid to speak up.”
When asked about this allegation, spokesperson Preston responded in a statement that said: “CYFD takes every concern seriously. We work through the appropriate channels to review or investigate each case individually. In cases where misconduct was [found] CYFD has taken steps to correct all situations.”
Committee members scheduled the next meeting for the morning of Aug. 22 at the University of New Mexico Continuing Education Building to address the salary for the position, additional qualifications and posting the job. 
Abeyta told Source NM after Tuesday’s meeting that the goal would be to send a list of candidates to the governor’s office by the end of the year.
“It’s an ambitious timeline but very doable,” Abeyta said. “I’m very excited about the work we did here, I think we’re making progress.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NM-Panel-selecting-Child-Advocate-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-07 08:56:25.339470

Even in California, where prison access to technology and research resources is better than average, students regularly face dead ends.


Since Pell Grants have become available to people pursuing degrees from prison, every state and the Federal Bureau of Prisons has tried to expand access to higher education. 
What they haven’t all done, however, is create a learning environment that supports college-level study. Some states still ban inmates from almost all technology, leaving students to get by with textbooks and paper assignments. Others don’t give students computers, forcing them to write term papers on tablets that lack external keyboards. When students have the right technology, internet access becomes the barrier, as safety risks surrounding how people might abuse it outweigh educational opportunity.
Getting a degree is one of the best ways to reduce the chances of ending up back in prison after release. Some researchers have clocked precipitous drops in the recidivism rate, as this metric is called, because of educational progress and its connection to landing a good job.
But the United States’ punitive approach to incarceration clashes with the promise education holds for lower recidivism. Bidhan Roy, the director of the prison education program at Cal State Los Angeles, has studied the restorative approach in Norwegian prisons and highlights the contrast.
“The concept in Norway is that the time that you serve is the punishment, and the job of the prison is to prepare the resident to become your neighbor again,” Roy said. “When you think about it like that, it changes the goal of what you do in there. Why would you not give research skills and internet access?”
Slow progress
When Roy first started developing Cal State L.A.’s Prison Graduation Initiative about a decade ago, students had to do all their work on paper. To give the incarcerated students a way to conduct research, Roy would pair them with an on-campus peer who could go to the library on their behalf and print out materials for Roy to bring back inside the prison. Once students started using desktops from prison classrooms, he pre-loaded academic articles onto thumb drives they could explore offline. Since the fall of 2023, his students have been able to search a much wider universe of academic articles online through EBSCO, a company that aggregates online research databases. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation purchased EBSCO access for students at all of the state’s prisons.
Little by little, Roy’s classes have improved for both instructors and students. Grading handwritten essays, he said, was a nightmare in itself. And students have blossomed as scholars with the power to set their own research agendas — a level of autonomy that contrasts sharply with their otherwise hypercontrolled lives inside. 
“There’s an empowerment that comes from that, and a learning of not just the narrow research skill, but the broader bits,” Roy said. 
Still, students run into walls. 
Suzanne Carlson, 42, got her GED in prison and then went on to get two associate degrees before joining the bachelor’s degree program Roy oversees. When she first started taking classes, they were with textbooks and paper only. 
“It was awful,” she said. She loves and appreciates the laptop she has now at the California Institution for Women in Chino, but the EBSCO database gives her access to only pre-approved resources and “the library here is very small in comparison to the things that we need,” she said. She finds herself wishing she had a Google equivalent to do her work. 
“I understand why [that’s not available] and I wouldn’t want to open any avenues for criminal behavior to happen,” Carlson said, but she is sure there’s a way to prohibit criminal activity while still opening up more of the web to people who are incarcerated. 
In fact, other states have figured it out. Kansas, Ohio and Wisconsin all have firewalled internet options for students on a separate network that keeps the prison’s network safe and still gets students access to educationally relevant websites. 
“We’d love to see more states headed in that direction,” said Ruth Delaney, who directs the Unlocking Potential Initiative at the Vera Institute, a criminal justice nonprofit. The initiative aims to expand high-quality post-secondary education in prison and Delaney’s team has worked with departments of corrections as well as education leaders in most states since 2012. Their early outcomes inspired the Obama Administration to allow some low-income students to access Pell Grants even while incarcerated, eventually leading to full restoration of Pell Grants to this population. Congress approved that expansion during the first Trump administration and it took effect in 2023. 
Still, even under the best circumstances, incarcerated students are broadly kept away from much of the human knowledge housed online. Unlike in K-12 schools, where filters are designed to restrict student access to dangerous or inappropriate websites and otherwise let students browse freely — a blacklist approach — prisons operate with whitelists: facilities identify specific sites users can access and the rest of the internet is blocked. 
Both methods keep students from more websites than necessary to maintain order and safety. In K-12 schools, The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, found high schools kept students from sex education websites, LGBTQ resources, Wikipedia and a wide range of other websites they sought out while doing homework. In prisons, Delaney said, the whitelist approach leads to “a very closed down version of the internet.”
For students who are incarcerated, the limitations co-opt their educational opportunity. Carlson finished her bachelor’s degree this spring but worries the credential won’t get her as far as she’d like.
“When I go into the career world when I get out and I go to apply for a job and I work next to others, I don’t want to have stunted growth because of things like this,” Carlson said. 
National trends
Last year, the Vera Institute released a report about the quality, equity and scale of prison education, assessing each state’s progress across 15 metrics. Two measures of quality were technology and academic research and library access. California received a “green” on both measures, a sign that its system offered “adequate” access, but Carlson’s research experiences illustrate the limits of “adequate.”  
Nationwide, the Vera Institute named technology an area to improve. Only 17 states were labeled “adequate” for providing technology that shrinks the digital divide and supports the quality of education. Just 12 hit the same mark when it comes to providing access to academic research materials and library services.  
Meanwhile, in 2016, the United States signed onto a revision to the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, naming internet access a fundamental human right with ties to the right to education.
Delaney said prison administrators often fear internet access for students could lead to violence or harm either inside or outside of the prison. But she said the fear, while legitimate, appears to be overblown.
“There is a lot of evidence that people who go to college in prison are not involved in the activities you need to worry about,” Delaney said. Students only qualify for prison education programs once they have a record of good behavior and even minor infractions can get them kicked out. They take the opportunity seriously.
Joe Tragert, vice president of product strategy at EBSCOed, EBSCO’s education division, helped create a prison version of EBSCO’s database of research resources, which holds over a billion items, including academic articles and media archives that users can search. In the prisons, users can only read and download the resources once they’ve been approved, but they can conduct their own searches and request access to documents. Tragert said he hears how dedicated people are to pursuing their degrees. 
“This is their ticket to either getting out and staying out or just getting through the day,” Tragert said. 
Limited opportunity
Theresa Torricellas, 66, completed her bachelor’s degree in liberal studies this spring through Roy’s program at the California Institution for Women. She said EBSCO was her main research resource and while it was full of sources, she ran into dead ends trying to study conditions in Palestine last summer. 
“A lot of the information that I’m interested in, it’s just not in the media,” Torricellas said at the time. “It’s very rarely covered in the media.” On the outside, she said she probably would have turned to social media for her research. On the inside, that wasn’t an option.
She also ran into problems with Wi-Fi access when she was working on her schoolwork. Wi-Fi is only available in designated common areas and the cells that happen to be close enough to pick up that signal. She lucked out for a while, but when she moved across the hall to get a cell with better sunlight, it didn’t occur to her she might be leaving her Wi-Fi access behind. She only discovered that after it was too late. 
This past academic year, her routine was to go to the noisy dayroom to search EBSCO for documents she needed or log into her course software to download assignment details and then go back to her room to continue working offline. Interrupting this workflow was the limited storage space on the prison-issued laptops.
“My laptop stopped working because I had downloaded so many EBSCO articles,” Torricellas said. Another person in the prison education program said the same thing happened to her after downloading only two large PDFs, but the newer laptops distributed by the prison have more space. 
As the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation rolls out newer hardware, it is also expanding student access to research resources. Besides EBSCO, students are slowly gaining access to JSTOR, another searchable research database. Students studying in prisons through nearby college programs, like Roy’s, get access to the JSTOR database through the college’s existing license, meaning it’s already paid for. 
Stacy Burnett, who directs the JSTOR Access in Prison Initiative, said many prisons offer an approach like EBSCO’s, where someone has to review and approve each student request for a document. Others have expanded access with a bulk approval tool. In some cases, state prison systems have bulk-approved an entire discipline; in Colorado, officials bulk-approved everything in JSTOR. 
“If it’s on there, a student can read it,” Burnett said. They can restrict access following a problem, but so far, Burnett said that hasn’t happened. 
When Carlson got to prison, she was shocked by the low education levels of the women around her. She went to a rigorous high school and learned how to read, write and conduct research. Others didn’t learn any of those skills. EBSCO and JSTOR offer a way to further their education inside. But Carlson said limited access to online research just compounds the lack of education many women got in the first place. 
“I feel like when it comes to education,” Carlson said, “the doors should be wide open.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/073125-PRISON-ED-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-07 08:56:25.339470

But the Grateful Dead symbolized defiance in a deeply political moment,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/jerry-garcia-grateful-dead-political/,"In 1966, the Dead were not political, at least not in the sense in which we are accustomed to considering politics. But these were inherently political days in California. Culture and politics swirled together.","Excerpted from “Here Beside the Rising Tide: Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and an American Awakening” by Jim Newton. Copyright © 2025. Available from Penguin Random House.
It is frequently the case that cultural and political movements emerge, thrive for a while and then produce backlash. 
Jim Crow can be seen as a response to the end of slavery, and civil rights to Jim Crow; the Moral Majority to Roe v. Wade; Donald Trump and “Make America Great Again” to Barack Obama and “Yes, We Can.” Sometimes the backlash is long in coming, while other times it arrives quickly. In the case of the American 1960s, the backlash came even before the movement understood itself, even before it knew what it was. 
Over the course of one year, 1966, a new notion began to take shape and an old idea rose up to push the new back down — or at least to try.
The Acid Tests and their offspring were the new. They represented a suite of ideas — experimentation and improvisation; culture wrapped around politics; communalism and joy; drugs, sex, music, love; restless values in rebellion — against what, they did not quite yet know. The backlash came from discomfited adults, and it gravitated to the candidacy of one man in particular: Ronald Reagan. As the Acid Tests darted across California in 1966, Reagan ran for governor. The two campaigns, one improvised, the other studiously deliberate, circled each other, competing for adherents.
As the year opened, the Grateful Dead were returning to San Francisco. Reagan, after months of traveling the state, officially entered its politics. “Ronald Reagan and A Need for Action!” the opening banner announced in the film released first to the California press on Jan. 3 and then to the public on Jan. 4. It included an exclamation point, but the presentation that followed was deliberately muted, a stern appeal from a reassuring man. Reagan was concerned about the condition of California, which had been reliably Republican, only to have riots and hippies put that history to the test. Now, Reagan was also here to make the case for old values, to make things right again. 
Old California was pioneers and visionaries, panners for gold, makers of movies. New California was rioters in Watts, spoiled kids at Berkeley, and drug parties featuring the Dead.
Reagan was the picture of conservative values. He strolled around his polished living room, complete with leather chairs and brass lamps, a grandfather clock next to a fireplace where a fire burned. Speaking directly into the camera, Reagan was poised and forceful but hardly alarmist. Yes, he was announcing his intention to depose California’s incumbent governor, the garrulous and personable Pat Brown, but Reagan never mentioned Brown by name. His criticisms of “the executive branch” were severe but never mean.
When it came to discussing the children of the state, Reagan’s demeanor noticeably hardened. It had taken effort and money, Reagan noted, for California to build a “great university,” but that was not enough. 

“Here Beside the Rising Tide: Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and an American Awakening” by Jim Newton. Courtesy of Random House
“It takes more than dollars and stately buildings,” he said, one hand on one of those leather chairs, the other in his pocket. “Or do we no longer think it necessary to teach self-respect, self-discipline, and respect for law and order? Will we allow a great university to be brought to its knees by a noisy, dissident minority? Will we meet their neurotic vulgarities with vacillation and weakness, or will we tell those entrusted with administering the university we expect them to enforce a code based on decency, common sense, and dedication to the high and noble purpose of that university; that they will have the full support of all of us as long as they do this, but we’ll settle for nothing less?”
For Reagan, this was an appealing political situation. The reports from Berkeley were, at least to those of Reagan’s generation and sensibilities, alarming. Radicals had somehow gained a foothold, outwitting their elders in an argument over what constituted learning, contesting even such notions as freedom and citizenship. Reagan’s central argument was that California was being mismanaged by soft leaders. Parents wondered about the taxes they paid to send their students off to the nation’s greatest public university system, only to have that system become a cradle of incivility and rebellion. Reagan understood. He pounded the university, knowing that it was the pride of his opponent. 
Reagan entered the contest with other political winds at his back, notably in California’s frayed race relations and growing white discontent with Black demands for justice. The Watts riots back in 1965, still smoldering in California politics, were the other pillar of that case.
Those riots had begun shortly after 7 p.m. on August 11, 1965, when two California Highway Patrol officers pulled over Marquette Frye, a 21-year-old Black man suspected of drunk driving in Watts, a neighborhood south of downtown Los Angeles. The officers pulled Frye’s car to a stop not far from his house. As they put Frye through sobriety tests, his mother and brother saw what was happening and defended him, loudly arguing with the officers. A crowd began to gather, and when the CHP took Ronald and Rena Frye into custody, the situation devolved. Within hours, a thousand people were in the streets, wrangling with police through the night.
That was just the beginning, a “prelude to Act I of a terrible tragedy,” as the Los Angeles Times put it. Over the next two days, 34 people died as violence spread outward from Watts and throughout south L.A. Racism, redlining, police brutality, the grinding effects of poverty, all simmered beneath the surface of the riots, but polls afterward showed that white Americans overwhelmingly believed “that the riots were started and carried out by irresponsible Negroes.” Those sentiments — resentment that Black people did not appreciate California’s efforts at desegregation, anger that Black people would resort to violence — suggested a core of white discontent. 
Black activists would find common ground with the nascent counterculture. Whites, bewildered and self-righteous, would find their way to Reagan.
As Reagan well knew, Brown was vulnerable on both the events at Berkeley and the riots. The university was Brown’s most beloved contribution to California, and he was conspicuously absent for Watts, vacationing in Greece when the riots broke out, so every reminder of the riots was a new reiteration of the charge that he was missing when it mattered. And that was, after all, Reagan’s larger, only vaguely subtextual point: that adults had fled the scene, that teenagers — or Black people — were running wild.
Proof of that were the Acid Tests. The sight of young people, high on God knows what, dressed in weird clothes, their hair long and unwashed, resurfaced old images of “Reefer Madness” and disreputable Beatniks; it was enough to unsettle the most complacent parent. They seemed of a piece with protest and riots — part of the mounting sense that something was slipping away, some shared commitment to order, to American values. Something new was afoot, and to them it did not seem good. It felt to some like communism, not because most Americans knew much about communism but because, like communism, this new force, this growing energy, was threatening, subversive. People — voters — were afraid.
Reagan reminded them that they hadn’t always felt this fear, that they had a right to security. These were their children in these schools. How could they sit still as their own children rejected their values? It was so obviously wrong, and surely it could not be their fault. They worked hard, paid to build the colleges that now threw their intellectual superiority back in their faces, paid for the social programs meant to show that they cared about Black people, who now rioted in response. How dare they? 
Reagan assured them that it was not their fault, that others — drug dealers, well-intentioned but misguided leaders, yes, even communists — were behind this unrest, and that he would tend to it.
“In 1966, the world, and especially California, was changing fast. The change was actually visible on the streets of San Francisco, at places like the Fillmore and the Avalon Ballroom.”ROBERT STONE, NOVELIST AND MEMBER OF THE MERRY PRANKSTERS
As Reagan stalked Pat Brown, Jerry Garcia responded with what looked like indifference. Reagan denounced drugs and young misfits; Garcia and the Dead dropped acid and performed, every bit the misfits that Reagan made them out to be. Through the winter and spring of 1966, they moved up and down the coast, crisscrossing Reagan’s campaign and ignoring the candidate’s challenge to everything they stood for. 
The Dead, as has often been noted, were not political, at least not in the sense in which we are accustomed to considering politics. They did not endorse Pat Brown or appear at benefits for him. They did not raise money for candidates or try to turn out young voters. 
But that defines politics too narrowly. These were inherently political days. Culture and politics swirled together. Getting high was political. Dancing was political. An Acid Test was an evening of fun and experimentation but, importantly, also an act of defiance. If one considers politics broadly — as protest, as the clash of values and ways of living — the Dead were at the center of California politics in 1966.
“In 1966, the world, and especially California, was changing fast,” Robert Stone, a friend of the Merry Pranksters, wrote. “The change was actually visible on the streets of San Francisco, at places like the Fillmore and the Avalon Ballroom. Political and social institutions were so lacking in humor and self-confidence that they crumbled at a wisecrack.”

(Photo by Derek White/Getty Images for Bentonville Film Festival)A couple of years ago, Alisa Jno-Charles saw her now 9-year-old daughter watching a YouTube video of several children and their swift ninja moves.
The video was from Ninja Kidz TV, a YouTube channel that features four young siblings who were raised in a martial arts studio, according to their official website. The channel has about 23.9 million subscribers.
Jno-Charles scrolled through the Ninja Kidz TV videos and noticed that the content featured more than just the kids’ ninja antics: Every single part of their lives was documented, she said.
“It was their first date, and their insecurities about social situations, and major life decisions — like the type of school they should go to — and their birthday parties,” Jno-Charles said. “It was everything. And that didn’t sit well with me.”
Jno-Charles did some more digging into “kidfluencing” on YouTube. She knew, of course, about social media influencers, and that it had become accepted as a legitimate job — for adults. But were there protections, she wondered, “for children who can’t actually make that decision to go into that business themselves?”
An increasing number of state lawmakers are asking the same question.
In the absence of federal regulations, some legislators are pushing to protect child influencers. Many of the measures aim to ensure kids are compensated fairly for their work, by requiring those with account managers — usually their parents — to set aside any earnings in a trust fund the children can access once they are adults. Some of the bills also aim to give children more control over the content they are featured in.
The experience with her daughter prompted Jno-Charles, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to research the fast-growing industry.
In a paper published earlier this year in the Journal of Business Ethics, Jno-Charles and Canadian researcher Daniel Clark concluded that kidfluencing was “a new form of child labor” that can financially exploit kids and violate their privacy, among other harms.
“Kidfluencing represents a uniquely insidious threat because [it’s] seemingly so benign,” Jno-Charles and Clark wrote. “It is prone to willful blindness from the parents, the platforms, the audience, and society at large.”
The risks are especially great, they argue, when kidfluencers are the family’s primary source of income, “obscuring the distinction between the best interests of the child and those of the family.”
But Jno-Charles said many of the state bills focus on financial compensation while ignoring other issues, such as the child’s reputation and whether it will harm their future employment opportunities, relationships and more.
“We’ve seen so many stories come out on families that have exploited and abused their children in a lot of very terrible ways, the least of which is monetarily,” she said. “How do you protect children from those situations? I feel like these regulations are a good start, but it’s not really addressing what I perceive to be the true issues around influence.”
40 million subs
Kidfluencers and other content creators make money by hawking products and services to the people who follow them. The job has become increasingly lucrative as companies spend more on social media marketing. Some influencers can earn $10,000 or more for a single post, said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit focused on science and technology.
Ryan’s World is largely credited as being the first kidfluencer channel on YouTube. The channel got its start in 2015 with videos featuring 3-year-old Ryan Kaji, who enjoyed unboxing new toys.
Today, Ryan is entering his teen years, and Ryan’s World has nearly 40 million subscribers. The Ryan’s World brand is managed by Sunlight Entertainment, a family-owned production company headed by Ryan’s father. And this year, Ryan Kaji was No. 21 on the Forbes Top Creators list, with $35 million in earnings as of late June.
“It’s so easy for children to just start creating,” Ambrose said. “And with TikTok and Instagram, the ability to edit videos and edit content now is so much easier than it was in the past. You can just start creating with very simple tools that are available to folks.”
Kidfluencers are growing in popularity across nearly every social media platform. While some youths have started accounts on their own, others are managed and monitored by their parents.
Other forms of media already have labor standards. Children who appear on television or in films have contracts that stipulate what they will be paid. Some states, including California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and New York, have laws mandating that employers of child actors set aside a portion of their earnings — generally 15% — in a trust the actors can access when they become adults.
The first such law was enacted by California in 1939. The Coogan Law was inspired by child actor Jackie Coogan, who played the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” and was one of Hollywood’s first child stars. When Coogan became an adult, he discovered that his parents had squandered much of the money he had earned.
States step in
In 2023, Illinois expanded its version of the Coogan Law to include kidfluencers, and California followed suit in 2024 (the laws took effect in 2024 and 2025, respectively).
This year, at least four states — Arkansas, Montana, Utah and Virginia — have amended their child labor laws to mandate trusts and other protections for content creators who are minors. And when Hawaii this year approved its own version of the Coogan Law, it included child influencers in the definition of minors engaged in “theatrical employment.”
The New Jersey General Assembly and the New York Senate also approved child influencer legislation this year, but neither has become law.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Zack Gramlich, who sponsored the legislation in his state, is a schoolteacher and the father of a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Both in the legislature and at home, Gramlich said, he’s worked toward ensuring kids are protected when they use the internet.
The Arkansas legislation he authored has a trust requirement, but it also includes other protections for child influencers, such as requiring adults to pay minors if they are using them to create content for money. For example, a minor must be paid if they or their likeness appears in at least 30% of the content produced over 30 days, or if the adult earned at least $15,000 in the previous 12 months.
The legislation also prohibits accounts from sharing “any visual depiction of a minor with the intent to sexually gratify or elicit a sexual response in the viewer or any other person.”
This goes beyond existing prohibitions on child pornography to include, for example, parents who dress their child-influencer daughters in bikinis or dance leotards for their followers — some of whom are paying a monthly fee to see that kind of content, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
Gramlich said Google helped him write the legislation. Ambrose, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said other social media companies have played a similar role in other states, and are establishing new policies for content featuring children.
Instagram last month announced new protections for adult-managed accounts that primarily feature children. This includes placing these accounts into a stricter category to prevent unwanted messages and turning on filters for offensive comments, according to the announcement.
Google and Meta did not grant Stateline requests for interviews.
A handful of legislators pushed back against the bill, Gramlich said, because they were concerned about putting too much responsibility on the parents. But when a parent is making an additional $15,000 a year by posting videos of their children, he said, there must be rules.
“In some ways, this is an extension of child labor protections,” Gramlich said. “We’re at the point where kids aren’t in the mines anymore, but it looks like they’re going to be on the internet. But now, their parents may be making money off their efforts, and they never get to see it.”
Social media audiences do not see the production behind online content, Gramlich said. These audiences are only seeing the finished product. And younger kids may not realize that their work is being used for money and will forever exist online, he said.
“If you’re anything like me, you’ve been told for the last 15 years that everything you put on the internet is there forever,” Gramlich said. “But can a child really understand what that means?”
The Utah legislation also goes beyond trusts. Utah Democratic state Rep. Doug Owens, the House sponsor of the bill, wanted to make sure that child influencers had the right to delete their content once they became adults. His legislation, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in March, requires that social media companies create a process for people who want their content removed or edited.
Before the legislation was drafted, two people reached out to Owens asking him to propose protections for child actors and influencers. One was a constituent — a child actor who had appeared in traditional television commercials.
The second, he said, was Kevin Franke, the ex-husband of former YouTube family vlogger Ruby Franke. In 2023, the popular YouTube star was arrested after her 12-year-old son, with duct tape stuck to his ankles and wrists, ran to a neighbor’s house and asked for food and water. She was later convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
Recent docuseries on Netflix and Hulu have revealed the ways in which kidfluencing can lead to children experiencing peer pressure, manipulation, child abuse and, in the case of the Franke family, torture.
Both the child actor and Kevin Franke said children in the entertainment industry — including kidfluencers — should have adults who are looking out for them, Owens said.
“I think social media is just an obvious place where kids need some protection,” he said.
But most state legislatures remain focused on broader social media concerns, such as age restrictions, said Georgia Democratic state Rep. Kim Schofield, who has sponsored a child influencer bill in her state.
In February, Schofield introduced a measure that would mandate trusts for child influencers. Her bill also would restrict children’s work schedules: A child between the ages of 9 and 16, for instance, would be barred from working more than five hours a day.
“I’m so excited to see that these kids are just so talented,” Schofield said. “They have a means to broaden and expand an endless universe online — I love that I get to see that. But if you’re making so much money and making the family rich, I want to make sure that you’re getting a piece of the pie.”

The Federal Emergency Management Agency this year added a new requirement that states spend at least 10% of funding secured through their State Homeland Security Grant program on “border crisis response and enforcement.” Washoe County Sheriff’s Office, which operates the Washoe County Jail, was the only agency to seek money for immigration enforcement, according to the Nevada Resilience Advisory Committee, a public body that on Wednesday reviewed the applications and ranked the competitive applications.
Washoe County Sheriff’s Office, whose jurisdiction is unincorporated parts of the county, requested approximately $430,000 to remodel its detention facility. The remodel will include “a screening desk, secure holding area, and office space” for ICE.
The co-location of ICE in the local law enforcement facility will lead to “streamlined information-sharing and real-time communication” between the agency and local law enforcement and “accelerated processing of detainees,” according to its application.
The application does not detail how overall capacity at the facility would change with the project.
A spokesperson for the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office declined to provide additional details or comment Wednesday and directed the Nevada Current to its FEMA funding application, which they said “clearly delineates.”
The Washoe County Jail already contracts with ICE to provide detention services for the federal agency. It is the only detention center in Northern Nevada under such a contract, though many agencies across the state will hold people for ICE when requested to.
Four law enforcement agencies in Nevada are listed as participating in ICE’s 287(g) program — the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Douglas, Lyon and Mineral counties sheriff’s offices.
In May, Nevada State Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus called on all local law enforcement agencies to participate in the 287(g) program.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice included Nevada on a list of 35 “sanctuary” jurisdictions, a designation that political leaders on both sides of the aisle rejected.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who is up for re-election next year, pointed the blame at Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, who has announced he is running for governor. Lombardo on social media wrote that Ford has attempted to implement sanctuary policies.
On his end, Ford called Lombardo’s comment “a blatant attempt by a desperate governor to earn praise from Donald Trump in an election year.” Ford said he does “not support policies that provide sanctuary to criminals.”
 Urban security program intact

FEMA late last week announced that half a billion dollars in disaster preparedness grant funding will be made available to states, easing concerns among state managers in Nevada that the program was going to be cut by the Trump administration.
Nevada scrambles to adapt to FEMA funding cuts, new requirement to fund border security

Emergency preparedness leaders had been operating on the assumption FEMA would not be releasing funds for the Urban Areas Security Initiative, a grant program that funds high-density potential targets, like the Las Vegas Strip. The state’s top administrator early last week warned that Nevada would likely only be able to fund “essential, sustainment-type” efforts and not enhancements to disaster preparedness and response programs.
Notices to states about the availability of UASI and other FEMA grant programs are typically released in spring. CNN in late July reported on internal FEMA memos suggesting the UASI program might be cut entirely. Applications opened for other FEMA programs late last month with no direction given on whether UASI would become available.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In the month since President Donald Trump signed the “big, beautiful bill” into law, more questions than answers remain when it comes to its impact on Utahns. 
State leaders are still working to wrap their heads around its wide-ranging consequences to the state and its budget — but in a report circulated to legislators on July 22, legislative researchers took a preliminary stab at summarizing what they know so far about the new law’s impacts on Utah and future policy decisions lawmakers may need to tackle to deal with its fallout in coming months and years. 
The impacts span many different state agencies, but some of the law’s most dramatic cuts hit health and human services the hardest, especially when it comes to health insurance coverage through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and loss of payments to hospitals that serve Medicaid recipients. 
In the report, legislative researchers point to estimates by the health policy outlet KFF that the “big, beautiful” law will cut federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over the next 10 years, which represents 15% of federal spending on Medicaid for that time period. 
Utah, that analysis projects, will see a 15% cut in federal spending over 10 years, or between $4 billion and $7 billion in that time frame. 
Utah hospitals ‘deeply concerned’ about Medicaid cuts. Rural areas could lose an estimated $870M

Other benefits for low-income Utahns, including food aid assistance known as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, are also expected to shrink due to restricted eligibility and removed exceptions to work requirements. In the report, legislative researchers wrote that an estimated 3,009 people will lose SNAP benefits in Utah due to eligibility changes. 
Immigrants, in particular — including lawfully present immigrants such as asylees, refugees and those with temporary protected status — face restricted eligibility for health coverage. Additionally, the law also eliminates SNAP eligibility for certain people who are classified as “alien” under federal law and legally present in the U.S., including those who have qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws or based on urgent humanitarian reasons. 
But it’s not only immigrants that will be impacted by eligibility restrictions for health and food aid benefits. New work requirements and other eligibility restrictions span wider.
Impact to Medicaid, ACA, mired with uncertainty
With an effective date of no later than Dec. 31, 2026, new Medicaid work requirements mandate that adults ages 19 to 64 must complete at least 80 hours per month of work, education or community service. The bill includes a list of exemptions for work requirements, including for pregnant women, foster youth, members of a tribe, people considered “medically frail” or who have special medical needs, people who are already complying with SNAP or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families work requirements, parents or caregivers of a dependent child age 13 and under, people with disabilities, or individuals who are incarcerated or recently released, according to the report. 
“Utah’s Medicaid expansion program will have a reduction in enrollment due to these changes,” legislative researchers wrote in the report, pointing to an estimate from Manatt Health that predicts 33,000 people in Utah will lose coverage. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Other national analyses say more — but Jeniffer Strohecker, Utah’s Medicaid director, told Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday that any estimates of how many Utahns could be at risk of losing coverage come with big “caveats” at this point. She said that’s because state officials are still working with federal officials to clearly define exactly who will or won’t be eligible. Those questions will likely take months to answer, she said, while also emphasizing that those changes aren’t set to take effect until late 2026, so at the moment Utahns aren’t at immediate risk of losing coverage. 
“You’ll see numbers out there, but I still think it’s too early to really look at the true impact,” Strohecker said. “So you’ll see a refinement of those numbers over time, as more of those questions are answered.”
For now, uncertainty abounds. It’s not yet known exactly how many Utahns will lose health coverage due to a variety of reasons, not just because of a loss of eligibility for Medicaid, but also inability to continue to afford ACA coverage due to enhanced premium tax credits that are set to expire at the end of 2025, plus other changes to ACA included in the “big, beautiful” law.
State officials themselves have unanswered questions when it comes to implementing changes to Medicaid work requirements or their exemptions on certain groups of people — including, for example, how to define “medically frail.” 
Strohecker said she and other Utah officials are working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to clarify numerous questions about how Utah will implement the new requirements, including “medically frail” exemptions to work requirements. She said those conversations have overlapped with discussions that were already happening after Utah officials, on July 3  — the day before Trump signed the “big, beautiful bill” — submitted its own work requirement waiver application. 
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

But now that the bill has been signed into law, Strohecker said state officials don’t expect to implement Utah’s work requirement waiver since it would likely take months of discussion before getting approval from the federal government. Instead, she said Utah’s waiver has acted as a jumping off point for further discussions with federal officials to eventually mesh Utah’s proposals into what ultimately gets implemented under the new law. She said the hope is to “use elements” of Utah’s waiver to “inform what the federal requirements look like.” 
“That is exactly the strategy we have pivoted to,” Strohecker said. “We are in discussion with CMS. They are very introductory, but Utah is included in those introductory decisions, and there are no decisions that have been made right now. Utah wants to inform the discussions. As we engage with CMS, we hope to be a voice that can help inform what the federal requirements look like.” 
Strohecker said during the public comment period for Utah’s work requirement waiver, Utah officials heard concerns that work requirements will create difficult administrative barriers for Utahns that will lead to lost coverage even if they’re eligible. To address those concerns, she said state officials want to prioritize making it as easy as possible for eligible Utahns to access coverage. 
“For us, as a Medicaid program, we have a year and a half to think about a required implementation for work requirements, we’re doing that work today,” she said. “We’re assessing impact today. We’re evaluating our staffing needs, we’re evaluating our system programming needs, and all the partnerships that we need. So we are actively engaging in that work today so that we are prepared a year and a half from now.” 



Worried about your Medicaid coverage?
Utah officials stress that changes from the “big, beautiful” law aren’t set to take effect until late 2026, so Utahns aren’t at immediate risk of losing coverage. 

If Utahns have questions or concerns about their Medicaid benefits or health plans, state officials urged them to call 1-866-608-9422 or email HPR@utah.gov. 
For questions about eligibility, contact the Department of Workforce Services online or call (801) 526-0950.



As for the impact of changes to ACA, legislative researchers didn’t offer any clear numbers of how many Utahns could lose premium tax credit eligibility, saying that’s difficult to estimate, but they warned it’s “very likely that some will, causing their premium to increase substantially.” 
Health policy outlet KFF has used Congressional Budget Office estimates to analyze the law’s potential impacts on states. While noting that “anticipating how states will respond to Medicaid policy is a major source of uncertainty in CBO’s cost estimates,” KFF’s analysis offered a range of enrollment impacts in each state, varying by plus or minus 25% from a midpoint estimate to account for that uncertainty. 
In Utah, KFF estimated that the changes to Medicaid, combined with the changes to ACA and the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, will result in 180,000 more people in Utah left uninsured — but that could vary between 130,000 to 220,000, based on that 25% range of uncertainty. Of the total increase in the number of those left uninsured, KFF estimated 52,000 will lose coverage due to changes in Medicaid, while 130,000 could become uninsured due to ACA changes. 
However, the true number of people in Utah that ultimately do — or don’t — lose coverage hinges on what Utah state officials and lawmakers decide to do in coming years and months in response to the new law. 
Utah Republican leaders say they’re still working to understand impacts
In response to requests for interviews with Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders for this story, spokespeople for both House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, issued prepared statements saying lawmakers are still working to evaluate how Utah will respond. 
“Speaker Schultz and House majority leadership are continuing to carefully review the bill and its implications for Utah,” said Alexa Musselman, the House’s majority director of strategic communication. “Our top priority remains serving our constituents and ensuring Utah remains the best place to live, work, and raise a family.” 
‘Lives are at stake,’ health, food aid advocates say of Medicaid, SNAP cuts in ‘big, beautiful bill’

Aundrea Peterson, deputy chief of staff for the Utah Senate majority, said Adams and other senators will “work closely” with the Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel, legislative fiscal analysts and the Department of Health and Human Services “as they review the bill and evaluate the next steps.” 
“Utah consistently ranks as the top state in the nation, and senators remain committed to building on that and putting Utahns first,” Peterson said.
Pressed on whether lawmakers will need to tackle any of the impacts in a special session this fall, or will wait until the 2026 general session to start addressing them, Peterson said, “Everyone is still working to understand the implementation and what, if any, the necessary steps will be.” 
When asked about the new law’s impact on Utahns’ Medicaid and ACA coverage during his PBS Utah news conference last month, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s answers were similar. 
“We’ll be working with the Legislature to look very closely at what that means,” Cox said. “Again, many of those cuts are going to be implemented later under the terms of the bill. And so I think everybody’s trying to figure out what that means and what the impact is ultimately going to be.”

The governor added that state leaders are supportive of implementing a work requirement — something they tried to do years ago before a previous waiver was suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic and then rejected under President Joe Biden’s administration. 
Cox also said “helping people get on private insurance is going to be really important. Making sure that we’re implementing the law faithfully, and that we have the funding necessary to impact people.”
“We end up paying for this one way or another,” Cox added. “If people … don’t have health care coverage and they end up going to the emergency room, which is where you get the most expensive care, all that does is raise rates for everybody else in this state. So we’ll look at programs … to help people who are struggling with their health care, and we’ll look back at those programs to see if there’s a way to implement more in the future.” 
Cox also said the impact to SNAP “may mean we end up funding more from the state level as our budgets allow us to do that.” 
The governor, however, also expressed some skepticism about whether the federal cuts will actually come to fruition. 
“I’m going to be really blunt,” he said. “Look, these pay-fors in some of these bills, we’ve seen this before, we saw this under (former) President (Barack) Obama, where they pass a bill and they’re going to pay for it with cuts in the future. And then those cuts never happen because Congress ends up feeling the heat, and they change the law a year later to prevent them from happening. So, I’m a little dubious that those pay-fors will all come through. But we’ll see.”
‘I just don’t know where we get the money from’
The Utah Legislature’s top Democrats — House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, and Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City — told Utah News Dispatch they haven’t yet heard whether the agenda for a special session expected this fall will tackle any impacts from the “big, beautiful” law, but they do expect lawmakers to start wrestling with its implications in coming months, and it will likely be a topic for the 2026 session and onward. 
Calling it the “big, beautiful, horrible bill,” Escamilla said its impacts will take years to fully implement, adding that many of its changes will not take effect until after the 2026 election cycle. But she also worries there’s only so much time to deal with its impacts, both on state agency operations, and on Utahns’ lives. 
“Here’s where we are,” she said. “Whether you’re a provider or an elected official, both local government or state government, we’re all going to be impacted, right?”
Even though estimates are difficult to pin down at the moment, Escamilla said the “bottom line” is tens of millions of Americans are going to lose their health insurance over the next 10 years and insurance premiums are going to increase unless the law changes. 
“People are panicking, rightly so,” she said. “This is the most gigantic cut on a safety net that the federal government has done, ever.”

If the cuts do indeed come to fruition, “someone else is going to  have to cover those gaps,” she said, whether it comes from state government, local government funds, charitable giving or elsewhere. 
“The needs are increasing, they’re not decreasing. Somehow, the people are still going to need access to health care and food,” she said. “The bottom line of this bill passing, is that states are going to have to cover the difference. And it’s in the hundreds of millions of dollars.” 
Escamilla worries that Utah’s budget “is not even equipped” to handle such a massive funding gap. She also said the Medicaid work requirements alone will create an “operational nightmare” to implement, which will result in people losing coverage simply because of red tape. 
However, Escamilla said in talks thus far with legislative leaders, there appears to be “an interest in making sure families in Utah are taken care of” and close or at least partially fill the funding gaps. 
“But I just don’t know where we get the money from,” she said.
Romero said she was left with more questions than answers when she read through the legislative researchers’ report on the law’s impacts to Utah, calling it “vague.” 
“I’m still curious (about) what’s going to happen here at the state level and what we’ll be able to do and what we won’t be able to do,” Romero said. “There’s so much that is still unknown. … “I’m hoping that as we move further along, we get more answers.”
Romero said she’s particularly concerned about the bill’s impact on immigrants, including those in the country legally. 
“Some of my biggest concerns are some of our most vulnerable and marginalized communities and just how are we going to adequately share this information without causing more fear that’s already there?” she said. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty right now.”

Gudger pre-filed a bill Friday to repeal SB 322, which allows a 250+ acre property in a dry county to be annexed to a wet city, a hot topic issue in Cullman County special elections.(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill filed for the 2026 legislative session by the leader of the Alabama Senate may have put the No. 1 issue in two Cullman County special elections to rest.
SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, passed the Alabama Legislature this spring. The law allows a wet city to annex a “community development district” with a size of at least 250 acres from a dry country to build a development that sells alcohol.
In 2024, Jeff Tolbert, a Cullman resident and owner of Trident Marina, announced plans to develop a $275 million resort along Smith Lake. According to the Cullman Tribune, Tolbert planned to have the development done by 2027 and employ over 300 people across what was expected to be resort spanning 2,500 acres.
A message seeking comment from Tolbert was left Wednesday.
The law has drawn strong opposition from almost every candidate running in two special House elections taking place this year in Cullman County, who noted that the law passed after two resignations left Cullman without representation in the Alabama House. Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, and Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April after being absent for much of the 2024 and 2025 sessions.
Gudger, who co-sponsored Waggoner’s bill in the spring, pre-filed SB 12 on Friday that would repeal the law.
“It’s at a point where, in my job as senator, is to bring in jobs, to bring in money, to bring in developments, to make us have a better quality of life, to get  money for our schools, get money for fire and rescue. I truly believe that this particular economic development project would have done that. But I am listening to the people loud and clear,” Gudger said in a video posted to Facebook. “So I filed a bill today … it’s going to totally and entirely repeal SB 322 in its entirety. That will be the first bill that I’ll pass, and it will pass.”
Messages seeking comment from Gudger and Waggoner were left Tuesday.
The law passed in 2025 will go into effect on Oct. 1, which will still allow cities to annex land until the repeal bill, SB 12, goes through the legislative process in the 2026 Legislative Session, which starts in January. At a minimum, it would take five legislative days for the bill to pass.
Jenny Folsom, president of the Cullman City Council, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the council has not received any annexation requests for the property on Smith Lake. If the council did, it would take months for the annexation request to go through different local boards to be approved.
“In any situation like that, the property owner or owners would have to officially contact, notify us of their request, whatever that might be. And that has never happened,” Folsom said. “So we have done nothing, no plans for something that’s hypothetical.”
The special elections in House Districts 11 and 12 cover Cullman County and part of Blount County. In total, eight candidates, two Democrats and six Republicans, have campaigned for the two seats and all but one candidate has expressed stark opposition to the law. 
Cindy Myrex, a Smith Lake realtor and candidate in the House District 12 primary runoff, said in an interview last week that people on the campaign trail are worried about a casino being part of the resort. However, Gudger amended SB 322 prior to its passage in May to prohibit the property to “be used as a site for a casino, nor may any other commercial or charitable gambling activities be conducted on the property.” 
Clint Hollingsworth, Myrex’s opponent in the primary, is also on Cullman City Council. He said in an interview Tuesday that he would oppose annexation prior to the law being repealed. 
“There are normal annexation requests, but this one is for a resort … this is a completely different animal,” Hollingsworth said. “As of today, there’s never been anything come across our desk with any request for annexation or anything up until this point, and will probably most likely never be.”
Matt Glover, the Democratic nominee in the House District 12 special election, said in a May interview that more power should be given to the community.
“Returning power to local communities, like just trying to wrestle away some of the power that the state government has taken from like local cities and towns, which plays in with SB 322,” Glover said.
In the House District 11 race, the timing of the legislation and lack of representation fueled opposition on both sides. 
“What I was against is the timing that all of that happened. The people that were giving me pressure, there’s not a representative from our district down there right now to tell them what was going on, other than Senator Gudger,” said Heath Allbright, House District 11 Republican nominee, in May.
His Democratic opponent, Alex Braswell, said at a town hall last week that there was not proper representation for the county.
“I think having economic development out on Smith Lake is a great opportunity for my county to have more jobs,” she said in May. “But that bill should have gone through the people.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Garlan-Gudger-May-14-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-07 08:56:25.339470

Last year, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank created by state legislation — was awarded a $156 million grant under the Solar for All program to finance community solar projects that would benefit low-income households. 
Now that funding is jeopardized by the Trump administration’s proposal to axe the Biden-era program created under the Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 law that dedicated nearly $370 billion to the clean energy transition.
In a statement, an EPA spokesperson said the agency is “working to ensure Congressional intent is fully implemented in accordance with the law” after the passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” last month. 
The tax and spending bill eliminated the IRA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund – which finances the Solar for All grant – and scrapped all unobligated money under the fund. Nevada’s Solar for All funds have already been contractually obligated, which could make terminating the states’ grant more difficult.
Solar for All is the only surviving grant under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund after EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of the fund’s other two federal grants in March.
The Nevada Clean Energy Fund said it has not received a Solar for All termination notice as of Wednesday. The nonprofit is still accepting applications, and encourages anyone interested in the program to apply.
“We hear from Nevadans every day that they desperately need the relief that comes from our Nevada Solar for All program, and we have been working hard over the past year to get these funds into the hands of the households that need them,” said Kirsten Stasio, CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.
Nevada has been racing to get money out the door after funding for the program was frozen in February as the result of an executive order from President Donald Trump. The EPA unfroze those funds the following month in response to court orders.
The Nevada Clean Energy Fund selected its first project under the program last month, which would provide low-cost solar power for The Empowerment Center’s new sober living facility in Reno.
“We received a Nevada Solar for All investment that is transformational for our organization and the women we serve,” said Roxanne DeCarlo, executive director of The Empowerment Center, which helps low income and at-risk women recovering from substance abuse.
“Lower energy costs mean we can focus more resources on what matters most: helping women rebuild their lives in a safe, stable environment,” DeCarlo said. 
Nevada is one of 60 grant recipients, including 49 state agencies, that could lose millions in federal funding if the program is successfully terminated. 
Nevada was awarded the largest Solar for All grant per capita of any state. Nevada received the same award amount as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania — states with significantly higher populations.
If terminated, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund said the state could lose high paying jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in additional private investment.
Mark Dickson, president of Simple Power Solar, called Nevada’s Solar for All program “a critical stabilizer” for the solar industry as it navigates difficult economic headwinds.
“Our workforce of over 35 employees, along with thousands of others from dozens of other companies statewide, rely on the continued support and demand generated by this program,” Dickson said. 
Nevada’s solar industry is already facing strain after Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy last month, including tax credits that fueled solar development.
Under the tax and spending bill, solar projects that start construction after July 4, 2026 will not be eligible for the 30% Clean Electricity Investment Credit — phasing out the credit six years ahead of schedule. If those projects are not in service by the end of 2027 they also won’t get the full credit. The 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit ends entirely at the end of 2025.
The loss of the residential solar credit is “already disrupting clean energy businesses,” said Steve Hamile, the CEO of Sol-Up, the company slated to install the Empowerment Center’s solar project.
“Sol-Up employs nearly 200 people, and the stability and demand from this program are important for sustaining our workforce,” Hamile said. 
The early termination of solar tax credits would likely require the Nevada Clean Energy Fund to cover more solar installation costs in the state while funding less projects, said Greg Zegas, the managing director of investments at the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.
Nevada’s Clean Energy Fund already lost a $20 million grant from the EPA in May that would have funded the construction of critical water and energy infrastructure on the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation in Northern Nevada.
Solar for All funds were expected to lower energy costs by at least 20% for more than 50,000 low-income and disadvantaged households in Nevada by 2029. 
Without the program, low-income households will be left with fewer options to address rising energy costs, said Beth Dunning, the director of community development at Nevada Rural Housing.
“Nevada Solar for All will lower electricity bills for many rural families who otherwise would be unable to access these savings and increase energy reliability in rural and remote communities that face frequent power outages,” Dunning said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels-worker-getty-1024x487-1-1.jpg,,,2025-08-07 08:56:25.339470

“Christina Hines is an experienced prosecutor who has spent her career fighting for Michigan families and we are thrilled to endorse her in one of the most critical races to take back the U.S. House,” EMILYs List President Jessica Mackler said in a statement. “As chaos continues coming out of Washington, Christina is the best candidate to win in 2026 and take on the reckless Republican agenda that is putting the livelihoods, health care, and freedoms of Michigan’s working families at risk. EMILYs List is committed to helping her flip this seat and deliver real leadership for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District.”
While the district is currently held by U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), James has opted against seeking reelection, instead launching a bid to be the next governor of Michigan. 
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report lists Michigan’s 10th Congressional District as “lean Republican” with Democrats viewing the seat as a key target in the effort to retake the U.S. House in 2026.  
In addition to Hines, Pontiac Mayor and former state Rep. Tim Greimel, attorney Eric Chung, U.S. Army veteran Alex Hawkins, and U.S. Army and Navy veteran Tripp Adams are also seeking the Democratic nomination in 2026. On the Republican side, Michigan Open Carry Inc. President Casey Armitage is looking to retain the district for Republicans.

Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, and Gov. Gavin Newsom during a congressional hearing. 
The video claimed that Hawley cleaned Newsom’s clock in their debate over a lawsuit that Newsom had filed. The problem is it was fake, created with video snippets of both politicians and a voiceover describing what supposedly happened.
The video, which has since vanished from YouTube, is a fairly crude example of how technology can be manipulated to depict seemingly real events.
More sophisticated examples of artificial intelligence, known as deepfakes, can literally put words in political figures’ mouths or even create seemingly real persons.
Last year, Christopher Kohls, going by the name “Mr. Reagan” on social media, posted a video in which Kamala Harris seemingly acknowledged that she had been the “ultimate diversity hire” when Joe Biden chose her as his vice presidential running mate.
Kohls said it was a parody, but Elon Musk posted it on his social media platform X, drawing criticism from Newsom and a vow to outlaw such material. It was one of many clashes with Musk, the billionaire electric car and rocket tycoon, after he became a Donald Trump ally.
Within weeks, Newsom signed two bills aimed at either regulating or banning AI-generated political videos. Kohl, later joined by other content creators, sued, contending that they violate free speech.
This week John Mendez, a federal judge in Sacramento, struck down one of the measures, Assembly Bill 2655, carried by Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat. He ruled that the federal Communications Decency Act protects X and other sites from liability for material posted by third parties, such as Kohl or Musk.
AB 2655 would have barred internet sites from posting deceptive political material during campaign seasons. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said.
Notably, Mendez indicated that he will also reject the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, carried by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat. It would prohibit anyone from “knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election communication … that contains certain materially deceptive content.”

“I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do,” Mendez said, adding “It’s become a censorship law and there is no way that is going to survive.”
As the country’s political polarization deepens, voters become more willing to believe allegations that those on the other side of the divide are evil, corrupt and power hungry. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence makes political deepfakes ever more sophisticated and capable of fooling gullible voters into believing their lies.
Exaggeration, selective facts and downright lies have always been evident in political campaigns, but historically held in check, at least partially, by newspapers and other political media.
Unfortunately, however, the mainstream media have fallen on economic hard times and have become less capable of policing political discourse. Meanwhile, X, YouTube, podcasts and other digital media have exploded as alternative sources but they tend to drive polarization rather than counteract it.
The bills that Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor enacted last year were clearly aimed at crippling media on the other side of the ideological divide but, as Judge Mendez ruled, violate free speech.
Censorship cannot be the answer. The approach that Newsom and legislators took is a slippery slope that would invite retaliation from their political rivals, thus deepening the already yawning political divide.
It is, however, a genuine quandary. Unfettered use of AI-driven deepfakes in political campaigns present an obvious peril, but so does any effort to prohibit free speech, no matter how distasteful.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080625-Person-iPhone-IS-CM-.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-07 08:56:25.339470

The Legislature is considering a contract awarded to William Lunsford after he was removed from a case after one of his colleagues used AI in a filing with the court. (Jemma Stephenson/Alabama Reflector)An attorney recently removed from a Corrections lawsuit after a colleague used artificial intelligence to create a filing that had fabricated citations is set to get another contract from the state.
Bill Lunsford of the law firm Butler Snow, who has handled millions of dollars in legal contracts for the Alabama Department of Corrections, is set to be awarded a new legal services contract from the department totaling $200,000, according to an agenda for Thursday’s meeting of the Joint Legislative Contract Review Committee.
The Alabama Department of Corrections directed questions to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office. A message seeking comment with the office was left on Tuesday. Messages were left with lawmakers on the committee.
A. David Fawal, also with Butler Snow, declined comment and the Alabama Reflector also left a voicemail message with Lunsford on Tuesday seeking comment.
U.S. District Judge Anna M. Manasco last month removed Lunsford and Butler Snow attorneys Matthew B. Reeves and William J. Cranford from a case in which they were defending Corrections in a lawsuit brought by Frankie Johnson. Johnson alleges that the department failed to protect him after he was stabbed in Donaldson Correctional Facility in 2019, leading to a second attack a few months later.
Attorneys for Johnson earlier this year flagged four citations in a legal filing generated by Reeves. One was not relevant to the issue in the case and a second stated that a  cited what it called a federal case decided in 2021, when in fact it was a state case from 1939. Two citations did not exist at all.
A subsequent search of filings found another fabricated citation in another document.
Reeves expressed remorse and apologized to the court and opposing counsel at a hearing in May. Manasco reprimanded the three attorneys and removed them from the case, while referring the matter to the Alabama Bar Association and other licensing organizations.
Manasco said the actions were necessary and that no other action will serve “the necessary deterrent purpose.”
Alabama has awarded Lunsford tens of millions of dollars in contracts over the years.
He was awarded a legal services contract in December for $4.68 million. Lunsford was also awarded a legal services contract for $7.68 million in June 2023.
The contract for Lunsford on Thursday’s Contract Review Agenda involves defending Corrections in a lawsuit filed by the family of a person incarcerated at Donaldson Correctional Facility who died by suicide.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3842-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-07 08:56:25.339470
