(Still from Cranston police body camera courtesy of Cranston Police Department)A state lawmaker accused of driving while intoxicated in Cranston in February can keep his license, but must use a breath alcohol ignition device for six months after pleading guilty to a traffic court citation.
State Rep. Enrique Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, pleaded guilty Friday before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal to refusing to take a breathalyzer test in exchange for prosecutors dropping a citation for failing to obey traffic control devices. 
He had pleaded not guilty to the citations during his initial appearance Feb. 19.
Sanchez, 28, must complete 10 hours of community service, undergo alcohol treatment, and use a breathalyzer-activated ignition device for six months, according to an order from Traffic Tribunal Magistrate Mark Welch.
Welch had also ordered Sanchez’s license suspended 30 days, but the ruling was retroactive to Feb. 19 — meaning it’s since been reinstated.
Sanchez still faces a misdemeanor DUI charge in Providence County Superior Court, where a pre-trial conference is scheduled for Friday, April 4. 
The second-term lawmaker deferred inquiries Monday to his attorney, former Rhode Island House Speaker John Harwood, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has reserved comment on Sanchez’s Traffic Tribunal plea as the criminal case continues. Sanchez was arrested by Cranston Police on Feb. 3 after an officer spotted him behind the wheel of a 2017 Nissan Altima stopped at a green light on Reservoir Avenue at 3 a.m. The arresting officer claimed Sanchez was disoriented and smelled of alcohol, which Sanchez has denied.

For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.

This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

Mike Braun on Friday announced two new agency heads for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and the Indiana Office of Technology (IOT).
A third agency — the Indiana Department of Revenue — is still waiting for permanent leadership. Kevin Gulley is DOR’s acting commissioner, according to Braun spokesperson Molly Craft.
Lyndsay Quist will lead INDOT as the second commissioner under Braun after Kent Abernathy, who held the role from Jan. 13 to March 28.
The State Personnel Department provided no reason for his resignation.
Quist will oversee the planning, building and maintenance of the state’s transportation infrastructure with a focus on quality of life enhancements, economic growth and accommodating new modes of transport, according to a release.
“As the crossroads of America, our roads and transportation are critical for driving economic growth in our state,” Braun said. “Lyndsay Quist’s experience of over a decade with INDOT as well as her experience as an engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared her well to step into this role and serve Hoosiers.”
Quist has served in multiple roles with INDOT since 2013. Before joining the agency, she worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the New Orleans District in Louisiana.
Warren Lenard was tapped to lead IOT. He will oversee information and technology efforts across Indiana state government.
“IOT works behind the scenes to keep state government afloat and operational. I am excited to announce that Warren Lenard will sere as the next Director of the Indiana Office of Technology,” Braun said. “His private sector experience brings the type of entrepreneurial mindset that our state government so desperately needs.”
Lenard most recently served as the chief operations and information officer for Byrider Auto Sales in Carmel and as the vice president of Technology and Operations for JD Sports Finish Line in Indianapolis.

It was six months ago that Hurricane Helene devastated much of western North Carolina with record-breaking rainfall and flooding. Since that time, federal, state and local officials have worked in determined — often heroic — fashion to help communities recover.
Today, however, the situation is best described as mixed. As NC Newsline learned in a conversation with Buncombe County State Representative Lindsey Prather, while much of the region is back up and running, the situation varies widely from place to place. While most roads are clear and many homes and businesses back to normal, huge needs remain, and Prather says much more is needed from state government — particularly in the way of grants — to help get the region’s economy back on its feet.

(Photo: Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
 

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Together, the two fires burning in Greenville and Pickens counties grew to more than 13,500 acres over the weekend. By Saturday, the Table Rock wildfire in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains had become the largest, single mountain fire in state history.
Neither grew significantly between Sunday and Monday, with help from rain and increasing containment, according to a Monday update from the state Forestry Commission.
As of Monday morning, the Table Rock fire was 30% contained, and the Persimmon Ridge fire was 64% contained, according to the commission. That was a big improvement from Friday, a week after the first fire started, when both were at 0% containment.
“Yesterday’s rainfall, coupled with the strong firefighting efforts over the past several days, have allowed us to make great progress on the fires,” Mike Brod, who oversees a team of firefighters, said in a Monday morning update.
No homes had been damaged, and no injuries or deaths had been reported as of Monday, according to the commission.
People in Pickens County were allowed to return home Saturday evening as evacuations shifted from mandatory to voluntary. Greenville County residents nearest the blaze on Persimmon Ridge remained under mandatory evacuation orders.

The larger Table Rock fire, which was burning at more than 12,500 acres Monday, jumped the North Carolina border Sunday, igniting more than 500 acres over the state line in Transylvania County.
Officials planned to focus Monday on the northern and eastern edges of the Table Rock fire where the fire was smoldering. The half-inch or so of rain that fell Sunday will allow firefighters to work much closer to the flames, preventing them from spreading, Brod said.
The eastern edge of the Persimmon Ridge Fire was also a concern, since the flames had reached debris leftover from Hurricane Helene. Crews planned to break up the piles of debris to reduce fuel for the fire, Brod said.
More rain is expected Monday, with the National Weather Service predicting thunderstorms throughout the day Monday and again Wednesday.
Following the weekend rain showers, officials lifted a statewide burn ban for all but five counties.
Residents in Greenville, Horry, Oconee, Pickens and Spartanburg counties still may not set fires outdoors because resources are already stretched thin fighting fires in those areas, according to a news release.
Both fires were set by people.

Perez announced [&#8230;]","Screenshot via the Florida Channel of Gov. Ron DeSantis in Orlando on March 31, 2025. Insisting more Floridians are clamoring for cuts to their property taxes than sales taxes, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday attempted to hijack the proposal just announced by House Speaker Danny Perez to save Floridians nearly $5 billion in sales taxes and said that instead the Legislature should direct that cut towards property taxes.
Perez announced last week that he wanted to cut the sales tax for all Floridians this year from 6% to 5.25% — which, if passed, would save them nearly $5 billion. DeSantis dismissed the idea on Monday, though, saying that while well intentioned it would do nothing for Floridians hungering for property tax relief.
A sales tax cut isn’t the first place to go when it looks to providing relief for Floridians, he said.
“I want Canadian tourists and Brazilian tourists subsidizing the state, making it so Florida residents pay less less taxes,” DeSantis said at the Florida Realtors office in Orlando. “I don’t want to give Canadians a tax cut.”
He later doubled down, emphasizing that a sales tax wouldn’t be well directed.
“It also allows relief for foreigners. It allows for relief for visitors and part-time residents,” he said. “I think that tax relief needs to be focused on Floridians. We need a Florida First tax package.”
DeSantis has been speaking for more than a month about providing property tax relief, potentially by placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot next year to eliminate the ability of local governments to collect property taxes.
He took the House’s proposal as evidence that chamber is up for providing billions in tax cuts, and “if that’s something that they’re willing to discuss, we’ll accept that, but we’ll come with a proposal to focus that $5 billion on reducing property taxes for people in Florida.”
He added that if the Legislature agrees to that idea, it would be the “opening salvo” in providing major property tax relief for Florida homeowners, because he still hopes the Legislature will vote to place a constitutional ballot on the 2026 ballot removing local property taxes.
State pays the difference?
Such a proposal could result in approximately $1,000 in property tax cuts for every homesteaded Floridian, the governor said. Although most property taxes go to local governments, the state could cut what is known as the Required Local Effort, which pays for schools, he continued. He suggested the state could make up that difference through its budget reserves.
“We don’t need people to pay property taxes on that specific line-item,” he said. “So we would roll that back to zero. We’d also roll back some of the local lines and issue a rebate and that’s how you end up getting to the $1,000 per resident or homesteaded property.”
The Phoenix reached out to Perez’ office for comment but did not receive an immediate response.
Senate President Ben Albritton said last week that he was “open-minded” about Perez’s proposal to cut the sales tax.
“Everybody knows right now we have an affordability challenge with many families in Florida,” he said during a press conference on Thursday. “We’re reviewing what the proposal looks like and we’ll see where it goes, but, to be clear, we are supportive of lower taxes in Florida.”
Florida ranks near the middle of the states for per capita property tax revenue, according to the Florida Policy Institute. That’s not good enough, DeSantis says.
“You gotta do property relief,” he repeated towards the end of Monday’s news conference. “If you want to do sales on top of that, I’m all for that, for sure, but this property stuff needs to be addressed.”

The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina six months ago was, in many communities, enormous. Few aspects of normal life escaped being upended, and one very important such area was child care.
As journalist Sara Murphy detailed in a recent report published by NC Newsline and the national news site, the Hechinger Report, six months after the storm, many young children and their families are still struggling with the disaster’s consequences. At least 55 early child care centers were damaged in the storm, and several remain shut or are operating out of a temporary location. And the ramifications for kids, parents and the region’s economy continue to take a toll.

The Wichita Republican hopes lawmakers can wrap up the session after returning to Topeka on April 10. That would be before the mid-April release of new state government revenue estimates typically relied on to fine-tune the budget. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly marked close of the Kansas Legislature’s regular session by signing a bipartisan bill forbidding applicants for about 85% of state government jobs from being rejected solely due to lack of a college degree.
Kelly, the second-term Democratic governor, said she previously implemented that standard in executive branch agencies under her jurisdiction. The House and Senate approved Senate Bill 166 to formally emphasize a person’s prior experience or specialized training when determining work readiness for state government jobs.
“I am pleased to sign this bill to codify this practice,” she said. “There are a multitude of factors that go into employment consideration, and a postsecondary degree should not always be the deciding factor.”
No more than 15% of state employees worked in positions for which a college degree was necessary. These jobs would be exempted from the new state law.

“Countless Kansans chose to build their careers rather than take on debt for a degree, and it’s time we recognize and reward their skills,” said Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican convinced he learned more on the job than in college earning a master’s degree.


The governor signed a cluster of noncontroversial bills last week as the 2025 Legislature brought the regular session to a close Thursday with a flurry of partisan activity. These pieces of new state law require higher educational institutions to update accreditation policies regularly, allowed dependents of military personnel stationed in Kansas to enroll in school early, voided a discriminatory residential covenant inhibiting a Wichita State University project and expanded college financial aid to Kansas National Guard members and their families.
Kelly will have an opportunity to sign or veto additional bills piled on her desk before the Legislature’s scheduled return April 10. House and Senate leadership want to quickly conclude their business for 2025. The goal of GOP leaders has been to tie the hands of Kelly in terms of budget and tax policy, while avoiding a repeat of the 2024 special session devoted to passage of a monumental state income tax cut.

Matter of perspective

House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, praised the House for its dedication since the annual session began in January. He deflected questions about whether he would run for state insurance commissioner in 2026, but touted work of the 125-member House under his control.
“We have done a great job this year,” said Hawkins, referring to the first session since legislators salaries nearly doubled their salaries. “Do you realize that not once did we go past midnight. ”
Lenexa Sen. Dinah Sykes, who leads Senate Democrats, said the session was artificially shortened by GOP leadership to get the House and Senate out of Topeka before issuance of new state revenue estimates in mid-April. Normally, the Legislature would rely on that revised financial report to set final spending and tax policies before adjourning. This year, she said, Republicans insisted on flying blind and risked unnecessarily cratering the state budget.

“Republican legislative leaders condensed the schedule this year to complete work before we fully understand how the tax cuts we passed affect our budget,” Sykes said. “It’s irresponsible to make critical decisions without knowing the full consequences. In the future, we need to slow down and work together on bipartisan solutions that address real challenges in our state and benefit all Kansas families.”
In 2024, the consensus revenue group met April 17 to revise estimates made in November 2023 based on the additional six months of actual data.
Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi, a Wichita Republican, pushed back.
“We have done a tremendous amount of work, and I believe a lot of good for the people of Kansas,” he said.
 
Veto pen at ready

The bipartisan harmony that greeted Kelly’s signing of a cluster of bills Friday clashed with the governor’s work on a pair of bills this session on election and health are reform. In both instances, the Republican-dominated House and Senate responded to Kelly’s vetoes with two-thirds majority votes to override her.
The House and Senate agreed to punt Kelly’s veto of Senate Bill 4, which ended the three-day grace period for advance mail ballots arriving late at county election offices. Kelly said the bill would disenfranchise voters. State lawmakers also derailed her veto of Senate Bill 63, which prohibited health care providers from delivering gender-affirming medical care to minors. The governor said the law ignored a Kansas value of respecting parental rights.
“As I’ve said before, it is not the job of politicians to stand between a parent and a child who needs medical care of any kind,” Kelly said.


Kelly will have additional opportunities to veto bills that range from much-debated legislation on taxes, education, elections and child support for fetuses to lower-key bills on firework sales, sex education, government secrecy, horse racing and employee background checks.
While issuance of specialty state license plates for nonprofit organizations rarely produced controversy, Senate Bill 18 would authorize a plate for Hunter Nation Inc. The organization says it was dedicated to the political or legal fight to build “a grassroots army to promote and protect the traditional American values of God, family, country and the hunting way of life.” Hunter Nation has a litigation fund to pursue its agenda, including a plan to end federal listing of the gray wolf as threatened or endangered in 48 states.
“It’s a very bad policy to use license plates to espouse political or religious causes,” said Rep. John Carmichael, D-Wichita.

 
The budget debate

In terms of the state government’s budget woven into Senate Bill 125, Kansas governors have the option of rejecting the entire package or making line-item vetoes of specific spending provisions. Kelly has used this power in the past to jettison earmarks inserted into the budget at the behest of special interests.
In the new state budget, Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, said she was concerned millions of dollars was earmarked to purchase a firearm-detection software system that would rely on school cameras to remotely identify people with guns. At the same time, she said, the budget didn’t appropriate enough for K-12 special education programs.
Sen. Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said the Legislature was once again spending far too much. It was wrong to have allowed state general fund spending to climb from $7 billion in 2019 to $10.8 billion in 2025, she said. She said many of her constituents weren’t beneficiaries of that largesse.
“It’s too bad those average families don’t have a lobbyist,” she said.
Sen. Rick Billinger, the Goodland Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee, said the perspective of legislators inevitably ranged from those who argued state spending was outrageous or measly.
“Everybody has their outlook and they’ve got things that they want or things that they don’t want. That’s how the process works,” he said.
 

Constitutional questions
The House and Senate, with two-thirds majorities, agreed to place an amendment to the Kansas Constitution on statewide ballots in August 2026 that would undermine authority of Kansas governors to appoint members of the Kansas Supreme Court. The current merit-based approach enabled a commission led by attorneys to nominate finalists for Supreme Court vacancies to the governor, who could pick one or reject them all.
Kansas justices stand for retention elections on statewide ballots. However, the GOP-led Legislature has decided Supreme Court justices should serve six-year terms and stand for reelection just like local, state or federal government politicians. Kelly expressed reservations about the proposed change, but constitutional amendments go directly to the ballot. Governors cannot veto proposed constitutional amendments.
“Kansans can reclaim power from the elites who have controlled the Kansas Supreme Court for nearly 70 years,” said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican who has challenged Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights and school finance. “Should lawyers chosen by other lawyers decide who sits on our highest court?”
Senate Concurrent Resolution 1611 cleared the House 84-40 and was carried in the Senate by a vote of 27-13.
“This is a blatant attack by the legislators on our justices, and it’s part of a decades-long pattern of politicians attempting to punish the judicial branch for issuing decisions on education and reproductive freedom that they disagree with,” said Micah Kubic, executive director of ACLU of Kansas. “We are confident that, just as they did in 2022, the people of Kansas will see this attack for what it is and, once again, take action to defend their constitutional rights from the power grabs of extremist politicians in Topeka.”
During the 2025 session, a slew of proposed constitutional amendments fell short in the Senate and House. The roster included amendments to block public tax dollars from being spent on nonpublic K-12 schools, to allow individuals to vote at age 16, to include ammunition and firearm accessories in the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, to affirm existing law requiring voters to be U.S. citizens and to allow prosecution of businesses who hire immigrants not in the country legally.
The Senate and House split on House Concurrent Resolution 5011, which would have limited growth of valuations on residential property to no more than 4% annually. The Senate passed the measure 27-13 after the proposed ceiling was raised from 3% and implementation delayed until 2027, but it was defeated in the House on a vote of 37-88.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3190541-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 12:23:25.903136

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)COLUMBIA— Legislation advancing in the state House would ban credit card companies from tracking sales of guns or ammunition and ensure no government agency in South Carolina keeps a registry of gun owners.
Similar legislation has already been signed into law in other Republican-led states.
The bill, dubbed the “Second Amendment Financial Privacy Act,” is set for discussion Tuesday by the House Judiciary Committee. It would leave enforcement to the state attorney general. Any government or company that ignores a warning to cease and desist would face a fine of up to $1,000 per violation.
“We wanted to prevent anything that would infringe on gun owners’ rights,” the bill’s lead sponsor, Rep. Bobby Cox, R-Greer, told the SC Daily Gazette after a House panel unanimously advanced the bill.
The bill has the backing of the chamber’s GOP leaders. The 34 co-sponsors include House Speaker Murrell Smith and House Majority Leader Davey Hiott.
The proposal does not apply to gun ownership records kept during the “regular course of a criminal investigation and prosecution.”
Legislation similar to the South Carolina proposal started popping up around the country after the International Organization for Standardization, a Switzerland-based group that creates international business standards, approved in September 2022 the creation of unique codes — called merchant category codes — for stores that sell guns and ammunition.
Businesses are coded for all sales made with a credit or debit card, whether at a restaurant, a clothing store or the grocery. In addition to banks using the codes to track rewards programs, the coding helps with business accounting systems and tax records.
Advocates that pushed for a separate code for gun stores, led by New York-based Amalgamated Bank, argued it was a safety measure that could reduce mass killings.
The killers in mass shootings such as the July 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater; the June 2016 Orlando nightclub; and the 2017 Las Vegas music festival all bought thousands of dollars’ worth of guns ahead of the massacres, according to a report by The New York Times.
Critics of the coding say law-abiding gun owners could be unfairly profiled and tracked as a result.
South Carolina’s Alan Wilson was among 24 attorneys general nationwide who signed a letter to the heads of American Express, Mastercard and Visa less than two weeks after the international group approved codes for gun stores.
“Generating a ‘list of gun buyers’ creates the obvious risk that law-abiding consumers’ information will be leaked, discovered, hacked, or otherwise obtained and misused by those who oppose Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights,” read the letter dated Sept. 20, 2022.
Nineteen states have passed laws similar to South Carolina’s bill, according to the National Rifle Association. They include Georgia, Louisiana and Alabama. Legislators in North Carolina are considering a similar law.
The laws were initially preventive measures that didn’t do anything, since banks hadn’t adopted the coding.
But then California passed a law in September 2023 requiring banks and credit card companies to use the codes, followed by Colorado and New York. The codes must be assigned to gun stores in those states by May 1.
A bill that would ban the tracking nationwide was introduced last month in the U.S. House. Its 95 co-sponsors include Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina’s Second District.
“It’s a real issue that is out there,” Neil Rashley, chief attorney for the South Carolina Bankers Association, said last week. “But it’s kind of in flux.
With some states requiring the codes and others banning their use, Rashley said companies with national operations will likely have to hire extra staff to ensure they’re following the rules for each state.
The bankers’ association is not taking a position on the bill. Rashley said he’s confident banks in South Carolina are not using the gun shop codes, nor do they have any plans to do so.
“We certainly understand your concerns, and we’re not standing in opposition to it,” he said.

For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death. “If [&#8230;]","Older adults participate in a falls prevention awareness day of action in Fort Worth, Texas, in September. Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are ringing alarm bells over congressional Republicans’ proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding, which could especially hurt older Americans. (Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved. 


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Despite his 2022 campaign promise to move into the congressional district he was elected to represent, U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner hasn’t moved — and now, he doesn’t plan to.
The 41-year-old Democrat first revealed his change of heart during a taping of WPRI-TV 12’s Newsmakers on Friday, citing family’s circumstances for why he has backed off his campaign pledge.
“We’ve decided that at this point, it makes sense for us to stay in our house in Providence,” Magaziner said. He referenced his family’s new baby, born in April 2024, and his wife’s new job that requires a two-hour commute from Providence to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moving to Cranston would likely extend that travel time.

The U.S. Constitution requires members of Congress to live in the states they represent, but not the district. Yet Magaziner pledged during his first run for congressional office in 2022 — filling the seat vacated by former Rep. Jim Langevin — that he would move into the 2nd Congressional District, which covers the state’s southern and western areas. 
At the time of the 2022 election, Magaziner and his family lived on the East Side of Providence, which falls within the 1st Congressional District. The capital city is the only state municipality bifurcated by the congressional district line. Indeed, Magaziner’s Providence home falls one mile away from the district line.
In 2023, Magaziner and his wife bought a house in the Edgewood section of Cranston. However, during his 2024 reelection campaign, Magaziner was still living and voting in Providence, outside his district, WPRI reported at the time. Magaziner told WPRI that renovations to his Cranston house were more extensive than expected, which is why he had not moved.
Now, the move is off, though the Cranston home is still listed under his wife, Julia McDowell’s name, according to city records. 
Magaziner’s office did not immediately return requests for comment Monday, including whether they plan to sell the Cranston house. However, he defended his decision on Newsmakers, insisting that where he lives has not hurt his ability to do his job or represent the 559,000 district residents.
“I continue to fight for the working people of the 2nd Congressional District with legislation in Washington, and I’ll continue to show up and deliver, just as I have for the last two and a half years,” Magaziner said during the taping.
John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, chalked up the scrutiny surrounding residency requirements in Rhode Island as “more symbolic than practical.”
“We’re so geographically compact in Rhode Island,” Marion said in an interview Monday. “If this were someone in Colorado who lived in another corner of the state, it might be a problem.”
Yet, Marion acknowledged the poor optics of Magaziner not fulfilling his pledge to move. 
Rhode Island GOP Chair Joe Powers seized on the “empty promise” in a statement Friday.
“Magaziner’s decision is yet another example of how little respect career politicians have for the people of this state,” Powers said. “He told voters he was moving into the district. He made that promise. Now he’s casually breaking it with a shrug and a smile, hoping no one notices or cares.”
Powers described the situation as a pattern among Rhode Island Democrats who “say one thing to get elected, then quietly do the opposite.”

Across the United States, gun violence continues to be an ever-more-serious national plague. According to the latest mortality data from the CDC, firearm-related deaths among children and teenagers in the United States have soared by 50% since 2019. In 2023, firearms remained the leading cause of death among American youth for the third year in a row.
So what impact is this having on the attitudes of average Americans? A new report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, entitled “Valuing the benefits of reducing firearm violence in the United States” indicates that it’s a big one and that most Americans would be willing to make significant sacrifices in order to address it. Indeed, the authors found that Americans would willing to pay nearly $100 billion for policies that reduce gun violence by 20%, and recently NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of the authors — Duke University Sanford School Professor Emeritus of Public Policy Philip J. Cook — to learn more.

Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.
I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



Last week, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

( Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill into law that sets up a new state aid fund for Kentucky communities affected by recent floods, though he has said the bill “isn’t enough.” 
House Bill 544, which received final passage in the General Assembly Friday with bipartisan support, establishes a new SAFE fund, or State Aid for Emergencies, to respond to widespread mid-February floods. The bill does not appropriate new dollars to respond to the floods. 
Kentucky previously started SAFE funds after floods in Eastern Kentucky and tornadoes in Western Kentucky.
Beshear said in a video shared on social media Sunday that he was “grateful” the legislature passed a new SAFE fund on the final day of the 2025 legislative session. The governor said the legislation “is going to help communities, cities and counties” affected by the floods, which took 24 lives. 
“After all or any of these natural disasters, the families that are impacted deserve our very best,” Beshear said. “They deserve that promise that we’re going to rebuild every structure and every life.” 
‘We’re there’: Beshear urges legislature to lift its cap on emergency spending

Under the legislation, $48 million will be transferred from the previous SAFE funds to the new one created by the bill. It also allows $100 million to be spent on flood aid from the current state budget on governor-declared emergencies, instead of the $50 million limit per fiscal year set by the legislature last year. Beshear said in February that the $50 million cap for the current fiscal year already had been reached.
When asked about the legislation before the veto period began in March, Beshear told reporters that the bill was “a little bit better from where it originally was” as it would allow funds allocated for next fiscal year to be used now. However, he said, that could be a problem for future natural disasters in Kentucky if funding is still limited. Beshear said that “while the bill isn’t nearly enough, I’ll sign it.” 
In other flood-related legislation that was filed this session, Beshear allowed a bill to become law without his signature that gives Kentucky public school districts options to make up or waive days lost to bad winter weather and floods. The Senate added protections for a controversial online school from enrollment caps imposed by state education officials. 
Additionally, the Senate passed a resolution that would have created a task force that would review how the state could become better prepared for natural disasters. However, the legislation did not move in the House.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/flood2_004-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-31 11:06:46.437705

For 10 years, Missouri had no incentive for production companies to film in the state. Now, more TV and film sets are coming to Missouri thanks to help from a tax credit established in 2023.


The “Show MO Act” gives up to a 42% tax credit on eligible film productions. Productions initially have the option for a 20% minimum credit but can receive up to four additional 5% credits for meeting certain conditions.


Last year alone, film productions working under the tax credit spent more than $33.5 million. The tax credit follows programs like Georgia’s long-running film tax incentive in boosting state film industries.

“That damn peach,” Missouri Film Office Director Andrea Sporcic-Klund joked, referencing the orange and green logo that appears in the credits of Georgia productions. “Hopefully you’ll be seeing our Missouri logo there pretty soon.”


Sporcic-Klund coordinates film productions in the state and promotes Missouri’s film industry through the incentive. Last year, four productions with budgets over $1 million were filmed in Missouri, which Sporcic-Klund says would not have happened without the incentive.


Film in MO, a nonprofit that works to support the tax credits, lobbied at the Missouri Capitol in February. Sporcic-Klund joined Pete Salsich, an entertainment lawyer who is on the board of directors at Film in MO, at the Capitol to promote the incentive to lawmakers.


“If you don’t have the tax credit, most of these films are simply going somewhere else,” Salsich said. “The tax credit becomes sort of your ticket into the conversation, but it’s not enough, because you can use that lots of places.”


The current tax credit is the state’s second attempt at incentivizing filmmakers to work in Missouri. The previous tax credit was repealed in 2013, with the film “Gone Girl” being the last major production in the state to receive a tax credit until the Show MO Act became official.


In the time after the tax credits expired, the state missed out on several opportunities for major film projects. The Netflix series “Ozark” was one of these productions, as the show drew much attention to the Lake of the Ozarks area despite being filmed mostly in Georgia.

“My hope is that we can get back to getting those solid productions that Missouri can be proud of,” said Sporcic-Klund. “I think losing them, like not having as big of a role in ‘Ozark,’ really changed minds.”


Renewed support for motion picture tax credits came to light in 2023, when the Show MO Act was passed. The bill was initially sponsored in the Senate by Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who says he is looking forward to seeing successful results from the tax credit.


Hoskins explained that about 4,000 to 5,000 college students were graduating from Missouri universities every year with some sort of media or film degree but were going to other states for work.


“One of the points of that bill was to put the right leg forward and build up that industry so those Missourians can stay here and work in their industry,” Hoskins said.


To be eligible for the credit, each project must meet the minimum spend for the length of their script, employ certain amounts of Missouri registered apprentices and meet the criteria for a “qualified motion media project,” as outlined by the Missouri Department of Economic Development.


Film producer Cole Payne worked on his most recent project, the horror film “The Jester 2” under Missouri’s tax credit.


“As a Missourian, it’s nice to be able to stay at home and film,” Payne said.


The film, which wrapped in 2024 and is currently in post-production, was shot in various locations across Columbia, Rocheport and Boonville. On set, Payne said, everything went smoothly with the help of other Missourians.


“In the town of Rocheport, the mayor came out and supported us. The local restaurants opened up for us, made us dessert and let us use their space at night,” Payne said. “We just hired as many locals as we could.”

More than 30 other states have tax credits for filming. For people who work in Missouri’s film industry like Payne and Salsich, the credit gives them one way to show off their state.


“The out-of-town folks rave about how supportive and friendly everybody here is,” Salsich said. “When people leave here and have a good experience, they talk about it and they want to come back and do it again.”


Besides affordability and hospitality, Missouri’s geography is also appealing to producers. The state is central, which is important for transporting equipment, and, Payne said, “Missouri can be made to work for so many looks.”


The tax credit is mainly designed to bring positive marketing to the state. One of the additional credits that productions can receive is a 5% credit for filming in “rural or blighted” areas, in hopes of increasing tourism and boosting local economies.


An additional 5% credit can be awarded if a film’s script positively markets a city or region of the state, as determined by the Missouri Office of Economic Development. For some producers, this leads to a creative struggle.


Payne’s film did not receive a bonus for positive marketing of Missouri, despite spending two weeks filming in Rocheport. He disagrees with the state’s interpretation of positive marketing.


“Screenplays aren’t written to say, ‘Hey, we’re in this state, and these things are very great about this state,’” Payne said. “It doesn’t mean it can’t be a positive marketing opportunity for the state or the city that it’s filmed in.”


Other rules that were tacked onto the bill also proved to be another off-set roadblock for Payne. He says that the 100% audit required by the Office of Economic Development was a “surprise” since most audits for businesses are usually samples, which are cheaper.


Payne is currently in production for his second film in the state, which will begin filming at the end of March.


After 10 years without an incentive, Missouri has a lot of work to do to rebuild its film industry. Payne is just one producer working toward that goal.


“There’s a production industry in Missouri that’s broader than just tourism that says ‘Come live here,’ ” Salsich said. “Invest in a production house. Turn some old warehouses into sound stages. Invest in more infrastructure to enable more support to exist and attract more productions.”


Salsich says that the impact of the credit is very broad and that it is already being seen through money being spent and jobs being created through productions.


At the film office, Sporcic-Klund is optimistic about this year’s outlook for Missouri films.


“We’ve had two producers bring back second projects already, so the word is good,” she said. “We haven’t made a big push because we know that we lost a lot of infrastructure in those 10 years, so we’re building that back up.”


As the state works to rebuild the film industry, lawmakers have also taken steps to support the Show MO Act. A removal of the program’s expiration was proposed in a recent bill.


“Hopefully we don’t have to keep bringing things in, because we can start building the infrastructure and build brick-and-mortar businesses around this industry,” Payne said. “We will be able to if we can extend or remove the sunset on the bill.”


If the bill passes the House, motion picture tax credits will be ensured for the foreseeable future.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Firearms legislation in Kansas took a backseat during the 2025 legislative session to tax relief and election debates, but advocates and legislators who see room for improvement in Kansas’ gun laws are hopeful bills addressing suicide prevention and child safety will be addressed next year.

For the past three sessions, the gun violence prevention advocacy organization Moms Demand Action has supported a bill bolstering efforts to prevent children from accessing firearms. House Bill 2167 would require guns and stun guns to be locked in storage containers, and it would create a crime for failure to properly store a weapon where a child has access. Penalties would be greater for firearms with large-capacity magazines.
Shannon Little, the leader of the Kansas chapter of Moms Demand Action, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that Kansas’ firearm laws are some of the weakest in the nation.
The organization’s safe storage bill was referred to the House Federal and State Affairs Committee, where rules allow anything introduced in an odd-numbered year to be brought up again the following session. The bill would penalize someone if an improperly stored firearm is used in a shooting.
“It would incentivize gun owners to responsibly store their firearms, and would definitely put the responsibility on secure firearm storage on adults and not kids,” she said.


At least two pieces of firearms legislation arrived on the governor’s desk Friday. Both have to do with law enforcement. House Bill 2052 broadens the concealed carry limitations for off-duty officers. Senate Bill 137 allows law enforcement agencies to sell or give firearms that were confiscated through civil asset forfeiture to licensed gun dealers. The governor could sign or veto those bills, and the Legislature could try to override a veto.
Little also highlighted House Bill 2379, a proposal from Merriam Democrat Jarrod Ousley called the “voluntary do-not-sell firearms list” act. Its essence is suicide prevention, Little said.
Kansas has a higher firearm death rate than the national average, and suicides made up 67% of gun deaths in the state in 2023, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The voluntary do-not-sell act would create an avenue for people to fill out paperwork to put themselves on a list that would prevent them from purchasing firearms. That paperwork would be available through health care providers and online.
Some kinks in the bill need to be ironed out, Ousley said, but he is operating within the parameters he’s politically allowed in Kansas instead of proposing a stricter red flag law, which exists in other states. Red flag laws, or extreme risk protection orders, allow authorities to temporarily seize someone’s firearms if they pose a risk to themselves or others. The provisions in Ousley’s bill make it so that any relinquishment of a firearm is completely voluntary.
“So it’s not infringing on their Second Amendment rights, aside from the safety precautions that they want to take on themselves,” she said.
The bill exists on a spectrum of prevention efforts, Little said. Even further down on the spectrum are nonpolicy efforts, such as asking a friend or family member to keep one’s firearms, that can be just as effective, she said. The thinking behind HB 2379, Little said, is to keep politics out of safety situations.
“I think it’s easier to start at the end of the spectrum that can do a lot of good (and) that the most people can agree on and, hopefully, get something really good passed,” she said.
The bill had a hearing March 13, during which several people told personal stories about loved ones or themselves. Some remembered loved ones who died by suicide. Many had purchased a firearm days — or even minutes — before they died. Some described their mental health struggles, stating they’d like to be able to sign up for a list like the one Ousley proposed.
“Six people in that room would have signed up that day,” Ousley said.

(Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging



The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Lawmakers will ask SD voters for permission to end Medicaid expansion if federal support declines

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
There’s a ‘very real chance’ of federal Medicaid expansion funding cuts, lieutenant governor says

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

The buoy, which has been periodically pulled out of the water for service and then redeployed, is designed to record and transmit weather data from a site called Seal Rocks. The information is important to oil tanker safety in Prince William Sound, but the buoy has had service outages in recent years. It has operated for only 35 days in the past year and a half, according to the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. (Photo by Nate Littlejohn/U.S. Coast Guard)Too many of the weather buoys floating in the waters off Alaska are out of service and the federal government should devote more resources to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the interest of marine safety, according to a resolution pending in the Legislature.
The measure, Senate Joint Resolution 12, calls for Congress to “take actions necessary to restore the full functionality,” of the NOAA’s National Data Buoy Center meteorological sites in Alaska, which relay real-time weather information important to mariners.
The resolution calls for the state’s three-member congressional delegation to work to secure federal funding for that NOAA program, even as the Trump administration is slashing NOAA’s workforce and operations. And it points to Alaska’s vast size, harsh weather and heavy reliance on maritime operations.
Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, the resolution’s sponsor, said Alaskans depend on the weather buoys and the information they provide to a degree that policymakers in the Lower 48 might not appreciate.
“These are serious life safety issues,” he said.
But the resolution is about more than buoys, Dunbar said. It is a defense of a federal agency and federal scientists currently enduring an onslaught of mass firings and budget cuts, he said.
“This is a good argument for preserving National Weather Service and NOAA funding,” Dunbar said, listing one of NOAA’s best-known divisions.
Of the 27 National Data Buoy Center meteorological/ocean stations deployed in Alaska, seven are currently out of service, according to the center.
There is particular concern about outages at a Prince William Sound site called Seal Rocks. The buoy there is supposed to be transmitting critical information about winds, wave heights and other conditions that affect the safety of oil tankers using the Trans Alaska Pipeline System terminal in Valdez.
That Seal Rocks buoy, an important source of weather data for marine-safety studies, has had intermittent outages for several years and is currently out of service.
It is at Hinchinbrook Entrance, the passageway between islands that connects Prince William Sound to the wider Gulf of Alaska. The area from Hinchinbrook Entrance to the Valdez terminal – which includes Blight Reef, site of the1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, is of special concern for tanker safety.  Under post-Exxon Valdez rules, oil tankers are escorted there by safety tugs, and shipments by loaded tankers are stopped when winds exceed 45 knots or waves are above 15 feet at Hinchinbrook Entrance.
The Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council, a marine safety watchdog created by Congress after the Exxon Valdez spill, raised concerns about the outages as early as 2018.
Those outages continue.
John Guthrie, the council’s maritime operations project manager, told lawmakers at a recent hearing that the buoy has been operating for only about 35 days during the past year and a half. That hampers the U.S. Coast Guard, he said, because it has to make decisions about tanker traffic based on less-reliable information from more distant buoys, weather forecasts or chance observations by other mariners, he said.

	While subsistence fishers, commercial fishers and others on the water depend on the real-time weather information relayed by the buoys, “the Seal Rocks buoy, in particular, is a key component of the oil spill prevention system in Prince William Sound. The risk of another oil spill increases whenever it is not working,” Guthrie said at a March 20 hearing of the Senate Transportation Committee.
Dunbar said the Seal Rocks buoy situation should be compelling.
“Here’s a concrete example where National Weather Service and NOAA funding is absolutely essential to the safety of the environment in Prince William Sound but also to the economy in the state and, frankly, the nation,” he said.
Legislative resolutions do not create laws, but they express lawmakers’ sentiments. Resolutions directed at federal agencies or at Congress, such as the pending resolution on NOAA buoys, are intended to persuade federal policymakers and influence their actions.
The sentiment expressed in SJR 12, however, conflicts with Trump administration policies concerning NOAA and its divisions.
Already, the Trump administration has fired hundreds of NOAA employees around the nation, including many in Alaska. The National Weather Service has lost about 10% of its workforce. Another 1,000 NOAA employees may be fired next. The agency is among those targeted by the administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE, which is led by billionaire Elon Musk.
The Trump administration’s objections to NOAA appear to be related to the agency’s work on climate change.
Project 2025, a preelection blueprint for a second Trump administration produced prior to the 2024 election by the conservative Heritage Foundation, cited that work in its conclusion that NOAA “should be broken up and downsized.”
NOAA’s divisions, including the National Weather Service and National Marine Fisheries Service, “form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity,” the Project 2025 “Mandate for Leadership” document said.
Though Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 before the November election, many of the plan’s authors have high-level positions in his administration. Those include Russell Vought, director of the Office of Budget and Management, who was Project 2025’s lead author.
Impacts to NOAA of the DOGE-imposed cuts and restrictions go beyond lost jobs and workers.
NOAA just canceled a scientific conference that has been held annually for half a century. The 2025 Global Monitoring Annual Conference would have focused on information about greenhouse gas emissions, carbon cycle feedbacks and other atmospheric science subjects. The 2024 conference was the 52nd held by NOAA.
Senate Joint Resolution 12 was pending in the Senate Rules Committee as of Friday.

The following is an excerpt from the recently published “Disciples of White Jesus.” In its description, Publisher’s Weekly says, “A shifting American culture is pushing white Christian boys toward radicalization, isolation, and violence, according to this persuasive treatise.” Consider buying the book at an independent Minnesota bookstore. 
We cannot understand the problems of radicalization among young, white Christian boys in America, nor fully grapple with the challenges and troubles facing these boys, without understanding what’s happening in American schools. And without consulting that most underpaid and too-often scapegoated American professional, the public school teacher.
A teacher I’ll call Joe, 59, is just the kind of teacher that hard-core advocates of traditional masculinity might dream up as their ideal educator for young, white Christian boys and men — at least at first blush. Joe, who has been teaching for 36 years in total, and 33 years in the Minneapolis Public Schools, stands 6 foot, 5 inches tall. When it comes to physical education instruction, which he has led for 23 years at his current school building, Joe is no-nonsense and almost stern, cutting a strong, athletic and disciplined figure, a product of his Marine veteran father, who worked for decades in underground pipelines after leaving the military.

Joe spends his winter days at an upper elementary school in a relatively affluent neighborhood of Minneapolis, with a student body that’s more than 85% white; only to drive across the Mississippi River after school to St. Paul’s Central High School, where he works as an assistant basketball coach at a school that is 59% POC students, including 29% Black students, in a neighborhood where 18% of residents live in poverty. 
It’s a fitting dual existence for Joe, who describes his childhood as a life in two worlds. His dad was a member of the Red Cliff Native American tribe, and the family lived together on the reservation near Bayfield, Wisconsin, even though Joe’s mother was white. He recalls that sometimes he was bullied on both ends, about his Indigenous ancestry by the white kids, and from the Native kids, called an “apple,” suggesting that while he was “red” on the outside, he was really “white” on the inside. Joe thought maybe that was because his teacher mom encouraged her four boys to do well in school, something that wasn’t always popular on the reservation, for myriad reasons.
Teaching PE and coaching basketball enable Joe to use parts of his skill set and personality that some advocates of gender absolutism might consider contradictory. He retains much of the “tough-love,” “old-school” military mentality that his dad instilled in him. And at the same time, Joe also saw the ways in which that hard-core masculine identity led his dad to a life of physical pain and even premature death. Joe saw the strengths and limitations of a masculinity that’s only rooted in hardness and discipline. So he brings a bit of his mom’s more nurturing side to his role as an educator and coach as well. After all, Joe says the best parts of his day are often the hours he spends in physical education with a smaller group of students with disabilities and cognitive delays. These students, who are often withdrawn or quiet or uncooperative in public settings, seem to innately trust Joe, something I saw firsthand when I served as a substitute teacher in his classroom. They know the rhythms and routines of the gymnasium; it was a place they clearly felt accepted, loved, and known — something achieved by an educator rooted in discipline and athleticism but also in emotional connection, patience, and kindness.
Given his popularity among many of his students and student athletes, and his continued commitment to athleticism even into his 59th year, you might think that Joe is supremely confident and undeterred in any school setting. But he knows that washboard abs or biceps would be no match for an AR-15 in a potential school shooting situation.
“That scares me more than anything as a teacher,” Joe told me, when we discussed the potential of a school shooter coming to our shared neighborhood. “Even who I am, there is very little I can do to stop that situation. The best thing we can do is just barricade ourselves.”
Joe says he thinks about it often, imagining himself in the shoes of fellow teachers and educators who have faced active shooters in their buildings.
“They probably thought the same things I do,” he said. “Your senses are so heightened as a teacher. You’re making sure all your doors are shut. You’re following the proper procedures for code red. What do you do? What do I do? What if I’m at prep? What if it’s happening in another area of the building? Of all the things, that’s the one that scares me the most.”
I’m struck at this moment by the seriousness and vulnerability and sadness that has come over Joe’s face. This is a man who deeply loves being a teacher. By the nature of his work with disabled students — among whom boys are overrepresented — and his role as a boys’ basketball coach, Joe does tend to spend a bit more time with boys as an educator and coach, though his office is also filled with cards from former students, divided equally between boys and girls. He’s also the father of a 20-something son, whom he watched attend school in the same district where he teaches. He says the two of them will talk about those boys who seem to fall through the cracks, the ones for whom traditionally male-dominated outlets like sports or mathematics don’t seem to fit, but who also don’t find their place in outlets like music or drama. He and his son recently together discussed the fact that two of his classmates — despite their relatively privileged backgrounds — had recently died of drug overdoses. Joe talked also of watching the boys who used to run with joy and abandon around his gym classes, pelting each other with balls, turn into sullen, withdrawn, and angry teenagers. Sometimes seeing them makes him feel sad and powerless.
“When you, as a teacher, can pinpoint those students out, you try and let them figure out a way for themselves, and also serve as advocate for them and help them find a way,” Joe says. “Sometimes they just need an ear to bend. Sometimes parents will ask me about younger kids and help them find a group, or a place to fit in.”
I realize, in talking with Joe, that it’s not his height or his athleticism or his perceived traditional masculinity that makes Joe a favorite among his students, or that has enabled him to have such longevity as a PE teacher in a challenging time for public school teachers, especially in inner-city, urban school districts. For Joe, for his students: the key is trust and relationship. He has been able to carve out a unique sense of both in his role as teacher and coach in Minneapolis. But it doesn’t escape me that even in this ideal school, Joe still faces the fear and anxiety of the violence of the wider world, the ominous threat of a school shooting.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1532870985-1024x461.jpg,,,2025-03-31 10:01:27.156599

Gaines/Maryland Matters)Lawmakers have had 82 days to deal with the major issues of the 2025 General Assembly session and, as usual, most of the big issues are still hanging with eight days left to Sine Die, the last day of the 90-day session.
But if anyone is panicking, it’s not evident. Most of the big issues are progressing, if slowly, and the House and Senate appear to be talking to each other on the bills where they have disputes. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a wrench thrown into the works in the next week, or that an unexpected issue won’t arise. Or that they’ll be done before the last minute.
But with eight days left, here’s where some of the issues we’ve been following stand.
It’s always been the budget
Coming into the session, it was clear that the big issue would be the fiscal 2026 budget, which had an estimated $3 billion deficit.  Uncertainty at the federal level related to budget and job cuts and agency presence in Maryland complicated what would have been a challenge in most years.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders have broad agreement on a budget that must be balanced. Their plan includes more than $2 billion in cuts and $1 billion in new taxes.
“What is very clear and what is the most important to note about this budget is that it is fiscally sound,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City). “It invests in all of our core priorities, like public education, public safety and health care, and it raises revenues from those who can most afford it, while protecting against the inevitable uncertainties that are coming from the administration.
Democratic majority muscles spending, tax plan through preliminary vote

“It is a sound budget that I think makes the appropriate efforts to put Maryland on as solid a footing as possible, given the level of uncertainty that we have,” he said.
The state’s General Fund budget — the portion paid for through sales and income and other direct state taxes — is about $400 million smaller than the current year.
Republicans and others note that many of the so-called cuts are accounting gimmicks that include holding open positions instead of hiring and shifting costs such as teacher pensions and the costs of property tax assessments to local governments.
Democrats take pains to note that their tax increases are targeted to high earners, and it’s true that 94% of Marylanders will see either a reduction in their income taxes or no change at all. But for many, the reduction — $50-$60 annually on average — will not bring the kind of “breathing room” Moore told reporters he wants the middle class to have.
High earners — $500,000 and above — will move into two new brackets. There’s also a new surcharge on capital gains for some taxpayers.
And any tax decreases will be offset by increases in vehicle emissions testing fees, taxes on vending machine sales, a $500 million tax on data and IT services, and others. One Republican calle the plan a “net more than it is a net less for taxpayers.”
The Senate will hold a preliminary vote on the two-bill package on Monday. The debate there may look similar to more than seven hours of back-and-forth in the House last week as Republicans unsuccessfully offered more than 20 amendments.
Ferguson said he expects a final vote Tuesday. The House and Senate can then convene a conference committee to work out what the Senate president described as minor differences — including the Senate eliminating a combined corporate income tax provision — by the end of the week.
The Senate version will also likely lower a House increase of the sales tax on car sales. In its place, Ferguson said the Senate is adding a $5 fee on the sale of each individual tire. The money would go to the Transportation Trust Fund.
“There’s been a lot of chatter around vehicle miles traveled, but there are concerns around privacy … and tires actually serve as kind of an interesting proxy for vehicle miles traveled,” Ferguson said. “The more you use your car, the more tires you use. So it’s similar to the gas tax. It is a user fee.”
The vote Monday means the legislature will miss the 83rd day requirement to complete work on the budget. That will trigger a letter from Moore invoking a requirement for lawmakers to remain in Annapolis to finish the budget if it is not finalized before midnight April 7, but so far no one expects the session to go into extra innings.
An energy package comes together
Also expected on Monday is an initial Senate vote on the leadership energy package, which includes a host of provisions intended to address high electric bills  for Maryland customers, with rates expected to increase further this summer.
With utility bills rising, some sort of energy reform was also expected this session. But it was not until last week that amendments suddenly debuted, bringing pieces of several other energy bills into one large package that is expected to hit the floor today.
General Assembly energy package a mixed bag for environmental groups

The legislation includes a utility bill rebate for Maryland residential customers, which is estimated to total about $80 per household, on average. But the payment, which would come in two installments, would also depend on a household’s energy usage.
“These will be immediate relief for ratepayers, who we know are feeling it harder than ever,” Ferguson said Friday.
The bill also aims to accelerate Maryland power generation — including nuclear power and potentially natural gas — and give a boost to energy storage technology, which makes use of large batteries to store energy for later use.
“We’re going to be focused on generating more affordable, reliable and cleaner energy than we have today here in Maryland,” Ferguson said. “This energy package gives Marylanders more control in the short term, in the mid-term and in the long term, to lower utility bills and address the threat of climate change at the same time.”
Environmental groups say they’re thrilled to see provisions curbing utility spending on gas pipelines, and preventing investor-owned utilities from using ratepayer dollars for private jets and trade association memberships. They’re also happy about new requirements for utilities to justify multiyear rate increases, among other provisions.
But the bill’s fast-track process for power plants gives many groups pause, with worries that the procedure will result in new natural gas-burning power plants that raise the state’s emissions, and jeopardize low-income and minority communities where power plants have previously been located.
“There are some things that concern us,” said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club. “Given how complicated and nuanced they are, these are risky things to do quickly.”
Blueprint reform slogs to the finish
Another issue that was expected to dominate the session was reform of the 10-year, multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, now in its third year.
Local school officials continued to say they need flexibility to implement the plan according to their counties’ unique needs and budget hawks saw the plan as ripe for savings, even though Democrats insist the plan has been budgeted for through next year.
The governor said he remains fully committed to the Blueprint, and the Moore administration proposed a number of cuts, most framed as deferrals or increases that were lower than orginally planned increases.
But those brought protests from advocates and pushback from some lawmakers, with the loudest opposition coming from the House.
The House earlier this month approved an Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act — the vehicle for the Blueprint changes — that rejected the governor’s call for a freeze in funding for community schools, those schools located in low-income neighborhoods, and a reduction in the growth of the per pupil fundng formula.
The House also stuck to the Blueprint’s schedule for increasing “collaborative time” for teachers, cutting down their in-class time to allow more time for planning, training and working on projects or with students. Critics said collaborative time will require hiring 12,000 more teachers at a time of teacher shortages, and the administration plan would have delayed its implementation.
The Senate this week will take up its own version, which roughly splits the difference between the House and the governor, accepting the delay in collaborative time for teachers, but siding with the House on the need for community school funding, among other changes.
The bill should go to the House later this week, which is expected to reject it, setting up a potentially contentious conference committee before next Monday.
Housing for Jobs Act lags
One of the governor’s priorities is running behind schedule compared to most other bills this session.
House Bill 503, dubbed the Housing for Jobs Act, was voted out of its first committee in the original chamber just Friday, meaning it still needs approval from the full House before it begins the process over in the Senate. There is a Senate version of the bill, but lawmakers there are letting the House steer the progress of the bill.

Lawmakers will have to scramble if they want to get it over the finish line before Sine Die.
The legislation got a late start in committee, with the first hearings not held until early thing month. Once it was introduced, county officials found many “significant” issues, including its goal of requiring counties to automatically approve new housing developments in areas with high job growth, unless officials could cite a specific reason to reject the project.
In the time since, lawmakers, county officials and the administration began working on amendments to address the raised concerns.
It took weeks to settle on the new bill language, but the House Environment and Transportation committee essentially rewrote the bill to instead create a commission that would recommend solutions to improve the state’s 96,000 housing unit shortage, among other changes.
The new language has been described as “simpler” and more streamlined, which could have a better shot of jumping through the remaining legislative hurdles in the condensed timeframe — but it’s not guaranteed that the governor’s bill can beat the clock.
New funds for abortion grant
Legislation to tap into some $25 million in insurance surcharges is on the verge of full passage, as both the House and Senate versions of the bill are waiting on final approval in the opposite chamber.
House Bill 930, awaiting a final vote from the Senate, would allow the Department of Health to use money that has been collecting dust for around 15 years. The Affordable Care Act requires that insurers collect a $1 premium per person per month that can only be used for abortion services.
Supporters of the legislation say over the course of 15 years, the fund has accumulated some $25 million, which could be used to provide abortion coverage for uninsured or underinsured individuals. HB930 would create a grant fund with those dollars to do so.
Senate Bill 848 is in the same situation on the House side, meaning if either chamber votes on the legislation this week, it will go to the governor’s desk for consideration.
Chrometastically yours, almost.
Maryland is this close to expanding its roster of state symbols.
  Lobbyist Ashlie Bagwell (left) speaks to her client David Shore before a hearing on a bill to add the mineral chromite to a list of official state symbols. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
A House bill to make chromite the official mineral of Maryland needs only a final vote in the Senate to secure its spot among symbols that include a state cat and dog, dinosaur, butterfly, cake and crustacean.
An identical Senate bill is scheduled for an April 1 hearing in a House Committee.
Since both bills flew out of their chambers of origin unaltered, there’s a good chance that David Shore, who eight years ago began his quest to have the mineral named as a state symbol, will see his efforts realized.
Chromite was first discovered in the Bare Hills area of Baltimore County. It quickly became an additive in paints and the making of steel alloys. It was shipped all over the world from Baltimore.
In a year of difficult debates on budgets, taxes and other serious issues, Shore’s “chrometastic” legislation might be the feel-good bill of the 2025 session.
And it’s fiscally responsible. Legislative analysts say approving the bill does not affect businesses or local government and “does not materially affect state finances.”
And no one is proposing a tax on it — as far as we know.
Reconsidering the Child Victims Act
Lawmakers will also attempt to pass legislation that will limit the state’s financial risks stemming from lawsuits filed by people claiming they were sexually assaulted while in state facilities.

It took a decade for the state to pass the Child Victims Act, a law that made it easier for child sex abuse victims to file claims against public and private institutions.
But the changes have exposed the state to potentially billions in claims. Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), the sponsor of the 2023 law and the current bill to limit state liability, said failing to act this year could bankrupt the state.
Wilson and his colleagues will attempt to make substantive changes to the law in just eight days.
The bill remains in a House committee. It must pass out of committee and get through the full House before it can begin again in the Senate.
And if it manages to get through the General Assembly and be signed into law, Wilson acknowledged it will likely face court challenges. Opponents of Wilson’s efforts say the proposed changes are unconstitutional and insulting to survivors of institutionalized sexual abuse.
Another peek at Second Look
Criminal justice advocates will be focused this week on the Senate, after that chamber’s Judicial Proceedings Committee advanced the House measure known as the Second Look Act by an 8-3 vote Friday.
The bill by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) would let incarcerated individuals who serve at least 20 years in prison petition a judge to have their sentences reduced. The measure has sparked robust debate in both chambers, which is expected to continue on the Senate floor.
“Philosophically, some of us are just probably at different ends of the spectrum when we’re talking about dealing with someone who’s in this position,” Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored the Senate version that didn’t advance out of the committee, said Friday.
The Senate advanced a similar measure last year, but it stalled in the House. This year, the House approved the bill first that included a more than two-hour, emotional debate during a rare Saturday session March 15.
The Legislative Black Caucus has labeled the bill a priority.
Reparations moving along
Another caucus priority was discussed Friday by the House Health and Government Operations Committee, which voted to advance a Senate bill to create a Maryland Reparations Committee.
Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), seeks to create a Maryland Reparations Commission to study the inequality African descendants faced in the state. A House version sponsored by Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County) didn’t advance from that committee.
The bill would focus on “individuals impacted by historical inequality,” which means those whose ancestors were enslaved in the state or “impacted by inequitable government policies.”
The specific policies would be from the federal, state or local between 1877 to 1965, informally known as the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. The bills say those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.” The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies.
Reparations could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives and child care costs. The commission would be tasked with submitting a preliminary report by Jan. 1, 2027, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.
Friday’s vote fell along party lines, with the six committee Republicans voting the bill, after more than 90 minutes of debate. Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair of the committee, stressed the need for a “calm, respectful” discussion.
Del. Teresa E. Riley (R-Cecil and Harford) said the bill would “pick winners and losers.”
“It’s going to be extremely difficult who would be eligible,” she said. “I think ultimately if we do come up with something that’s substantial, it will bankrupt the state of Maryland.”
Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), called the measure “political” and offered an amendment to have a report done by Sept. 1, 2026, in time for next year’s elections. But Peña-Melnyk said more time is needed, not just for the report, but to appoint the nearly two dozen members to the commission.
“This cannot be done in a year,” she said. “This would take so much time, and you want to do it right.”
Del. Kim Ross (D-Baltimore County) said the bill doesn’t create a racial divide.
“On a practical level, reparations helps level the playing field,” she said. “I would feel more pride in my state with a commission this like in place. I would feel good about living here.”
Other matters

SB357: Expands the authority of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board’s efforts to reduce the cost of certain prescription drugs. The Senate version of the bill received some amendments in the Health and Government operations Friday, meaning the Senate will have to review the changes if the House approves it before it can go to the governor’s desk.
HB39: Repeals a penalty for intentional transfer of human immunodeficiency virus. The bill just needs approval from the full Senate before it goes to the governor for consideration, while the Senate version of the bill is awaiting a committee vote in the House.
SB414: creates a one-time $1,000 tax credit for parents who had a stillborn child. With no House version, the legislation is awaiting approval from the House Ways and Means Committee, which held a hearing last week, before it can move forward.
HB102: delays the implantation of the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program by 18-months. The House approved the bill 95-34 Friday, but it still needs Senate approval. The Senate has not moved its version of the bill out of the Finance Committee.
SB 181/HB 1123: Both measures focus on medical and geriatric parole and have been approved by their respective chambers. A few differences in the bills include the Senate version stating that a person must be 65 years old to petition for parole; the House version set the age at 60.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/state-house-flowers-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

Tim Walz’s proposed budget includes an array of cuts to disability waiver services, notably to the inflationary adjustment for service providers. Photo courtesy of Living Well Disability Services. Minnesota is at a critical moment. The state’s commitment to supporting people with disabilities is at a crossroads. 
Gov. Tim Walz’s proposed budget includes an array of cuts to disability waiver services, notably to the inflationary adjustment for service providers. 
This threatens to undo years of progress.  
These cuts — from an 11% adjustment increase in 2026 to just 4% — are not mere numbers on a spreadsheet. They represent a threat to the quality and accessibility of disability services across Minnesota and serve as a blow to an already reeling workforce that provides these life-saving services. The impacts of these budget targets may be greater than the governor is anticipating. 
Of chief importance are the impacts these cuts will have on the workforce that underpins disability services. These professionals, who are primarily women and people of color, are paid low wages as it stands, especially as inflation impacts every Minnesotan’s purchasing power. Reducing the inflationary adjustment to 4% every two years ensures their pay will fall further behind increasing costs. As a result, this field’s vacant positions will become increasingly uncompetitive to new workers and existing workers will leave in search of better pay. 
We frequently hear from direct care workers: “I love this work, but I can’t afford to keep doing it.” Now, under the governor’s proposed budget, that refrain will only grow louder. Low pay and rising costs will drive workers away, increasing turnover and further straining already limited resources. 
While we hear the governor’s optimism that these budgetary adjustments will not impede the quality of care, or the number of people served, in no other industry could one expect such a large cut to not affect the work. To ask an industry that already stretches its resources to its limits to absorb this cut will result in serious consequences for those receiving care.
The ripple effects of these cuts will not stop with workers. Those receiving services and their families will bear the brunt of this proposal. Strained support networks created from these cuts will leave families with fewer resources to care for their loved ones, forcing them to shoulder an even greater responsibility. Potential facility closures will mean that those receiving care may not have the opportunity to live near their loved ones, to live in the place they desire, or to receive the care that best meets their needs.  
The governor and the Legislature must grapple with challenging questions this session about how to meet Minnesota’s needs within the realities of the state’s budget. It’s imperative these decisions prioritize the dignity and well-being of Minnesota’s many people who live with a disability and the workers who support them.
My final message is this: Legislators, I encourage you to see the faces behind the numbers. Disability services are people in our community, friends, and family members. I know you care deeply about equity and progress. I know you see an indispensable workforce for what it is. These values are at stake in this budget cycle, and we need you to balance it with the same compassion that we have come to expect from Minnesota. 
We are a state that has long prided itself on being a leader in giving everyone a fair shot at living a fulfilled life. It’s time for us to invest in those values. 
A reevaluation is needed, one with the outstanding legal and moral obligations to care for people living with disabilities.

This week: Massive cuts at the Minnesota Department of Health; the most diverse places in Minnesota; recovering ill-gotten gains from Feeding Our Future defendants; and county-level impacts of Trump’s NIH cuts.
MDH losing $226 million in federal funds
The Minnesota Department of Health announced last week that the Trump administration is unilaterally rescinding $226 million in federal grants related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This termination is effective immediately and impacts ongoing work and contracts,” Health Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “This action was sudden and unexpected.”
The cuts amount to about 25% of MDH’s current budget, according to KARE-11, and are likely to result in the layoffs of around 200 employees. The actions are part of a broader nationwide effort to eliminate $11 billion in spending by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Among the programs affected: COVID-19 testing and vaccination efforts; research to improve vaccine effectiveness and respond to future pandemics; and efforts to develop treatments for other types of virus with pandemic potential.
Minnesota recently scored poorly on a national ranking of health emergency preparedness.
Minnesota’s most (and least) diverse counties
Minnesota has become ever so slightly more diverse since 2020, according to Census data analyzed by the USA Facts team. But it’s close to the bottom tier of states on diversity.
If you were to select two Minnesota residents at random, there’s roughly a 40% chance that they won’t have the same race and ethnicity. The most diverse state is Hawaii, where there’s a 76% chance you’ll get two people of different races, while the least diverse state is Maine, where the odds of selecting different races is just 16%.
There’s lots of variation at the county level, too. Morrison County in central Minnesota is the least diverse in the state, with less than a 9% chance of drawing two people of differing ethnicities. You might expect urban core counties like Hennepin or Ramsey to have the most diversity but that’s not quite right: Mahnomen County in the northwest scores highest on the measure, with a 62% chance of selecting people with different ethnicities. That likely owes to the county’s high proportion of Indigenous residents.
Hennepin and Ramsey aren’t far behind, however.
Nationwide, the least diverse places are counties in Appalachia, while the most diverse tend to be located in Hawaii and Alaska.
Feds may only be able to recover $50 million from Feeding Our Future defendants
Federal prosecutors have seized about $75 million in assets from Feeding Our Future defendants so far, according to the Star Tribune. That’s just a fraction of the estimated $250 million in total diversions of money by the alleged fraudsters.
And the final tally of recovered funds is likely to be even smaller, as some of the seized assets are depreciating in value and will cost money to sell off. The final recovery might be as little as $50 million, prosecutors say.
Defendants funneled their ill-gotten gains into things like lavish trips, shopping and entertainment, prosecutors allege. Some money was squirreled away overseas.
In federal white collar crime cases, recovery rates of as little as 10% are often seen as commendable, giving the difficulties of clawing back money that may have been spent over many years.
The effect of NIH cuts in your county
A consortium of researchers at several universities have released county-level estimates of the total financial impact of cuts to National Institutes of Health grants announced by the Trump administration last month.
The estimates incorporate not just the lost grant dollars themselves, but also the spillover effects of the additional economic activity the NIH grants stimulate. Running the numbers that way shows that the cuts have impacts not just in the counties where the affected medical and scientific institutions are located, but also in surrounding communities that benefit from the economic activity generated by those research hubs.
No county in Minnesota is unaffected, according to the researchers’ estimates. Minnesota as a whole will see a $355 million decrease in economic activity, causing the loss of more than 1,400 jobs.
Hennepin and Olmsted counties, home to the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic respectively, account for more than $200 million of Minnesota’s losses.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P1229249-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

But one state lawmaker believes there exists another untapped market: corporate litigation.
Delaware and its centuries-old Court of Chancery is the undisputed leader of business incorporation and corporate law in the United States. Delaware proudly boasts that 67% of Fortune 500 companies and 80% of the companies filing initial public offerings in 2023 were incorporated there.
Nevada movers and shakers have long toyed with the idea of the Silver State jumping in on that corporate action. A bubbling of recent corporate dissatisfaction with Delaware has rekindled interest and created a new window of opportunity.
Democratic Assemblymember Joe Dalia is sponsoring Assembly Joint Resolution 8, which proposes amending the Nevada State Constitution to establish a dedicated business court.
“This will allow Nevada to compete more capably for the multibillion dollar corporate filings market by offering businesses greater legal predictability and efficiency,” Dalia told lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee, which heard his resolution in early March.
Nevada over the past two decades has taken steps to make itself a more enticing option for incorporation.
“However, despite the progress we’ve made, and despite having some very talented judges on the bench right now, our system still suffers from certain structural limitations that put us at a disadvantage relative to Delaware,” he said.
AJR8, if passed in the current legislative session, would have to pass again in the 2027 legislative session. Then it would go to voters in the 2028 general election for final approval. The particulars of the business court would then have to be established by the Legislature, presumably during its 2029 session.
Once established, the court would handle complex business matters, such as disputes over shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions, and fiduciary duties.
Courts dedicated to specific areas of law are not unusual. In Nevada, family court is its own division and judges do not hear civil or criminal cases. Courts in Clark and Washoe counties have operated dedicated business dockets since 2001, with the goal being to adjudicate those cases more quickly.
UNLV Boyd School of Law professor Benjamin Edwards worked on the resolution with Dalia. He explains a dedicated business court using a metaphor of a busy roadway or highway.
“This is basic infrastructure that creates a lane attractive for trailers so they are not next to your Corolla,” he said.
But the financial benefit would come when more businesses choose to incorporate in Nevada and pay the state’s filing fees.
Delaware, a state with a population of 1 million people and 2.2 million businesses, generates $2 billion a year in revenue from commercial business filings. That revenue makes up 29% of their state’s general fund. (On top of that, additional taxes, and economic activity, are generated by the lawyers and their staff doing increased business in the state.)
By contrast, in Nevada, business licensing generated approximately $200 million last fiscal year, according to a report from the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office, whose commercial recordings division oversees them.
Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, who supports AJR8, says if Nevada could siphon just 5% market share off Delaware, that could mean an additional $100 million in revenue that could help “solve some of our problems — education, health care, a lot of things.”
Edwards doesn’t think Nevada will cause a “DExit” —  a silly term being thrown about that plays off the UK’s Brexit — but instead will influence new companies. Even the initial approval of AJR8 sends a signal to the business community, he added.
“I don’t think Delaware will stop growing anytime soon,” said Edwards, but if their growth slows while Nevada’s business community grows that impact will “compound rapidly” and translate into additional revenue for the state.
Other supporters of the prospect of a Nevada business court agree.
“This is the type of economic development that is very cheap for the state,” said Bryan Wachter of the Retail Association of Nevada, which testified in support of the resolution. “You are going to consider a multitude of ways of approaching economic development. Some of those are going to come with a very heavy price tag. This one does not.”
 Dissatisfaction in Delaware

“Everybody who really understands (AJR8) supports it,” said Edwards. “If you talk to business lawyers or people who are familiar with it, they get it immediately.”
But for everyone else, including the lawmakers who’d have to approve it twice and voters who’d have to approve it once, the issue may come across as Nevada kowtowing to corporate overlords who are throwing a fit because Delaware was mean to them.
“Anybody who tells you they know the right balance between protecting investors and management in corporate law is an idiot,” opined Edwards. “Nobody has a clear sense of the perfect ratio.”
Nevada and Delaware simply “strike different balances,” he added.
Enter the 1,000-lbs elephant in the courtroom: Elon Musk, the controversial billionaire who in addition to being CEO of Tesla and other companies is currently running amok as the head of the Trump administration’s slash and burn Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk has been one of the loudest critics of Delaware’s Court of Chancery and has transferred the incorporation of three of his companies to other states. In early February, he posted on his social media platform: “Texas and Nevada are the best choices for incorporation.”
Texas became the state of incorporation for Tesla and SpaceX last year. Nevada became the state of incorporation for X Corp (formerly Twitter) in 2023.
“He’s someone who has brought a lot of attention to the issue,” acknowledged Edwards, but he believes it’s shortsighted for Nevada lawmakers to see the business court proposal as being associated with Musk. “It has nothing to do with him really.”
Aguilar, when asked about Musk being outspoken on the issue, all but changed the subject, and said there are a lot of good corporate actors: “You don’t hear about them” in the contest of business litigation venue attractiveness “because they are driving their businesses forward, and they want a fair environment.”
Businesses have broader issues — primarily how easy it is to file litigation against corporations in Delaware — that are long-standing but largely uninteresting to people outside of the insular corporate law world.
“Every maybe 30 years or so there will be something that happens in Delaware that leads to a lot of people freaking out about something,” said Edwards.
Indeed, proponents in the late 1990s and early aughts pitched the establishment of dedicated business dockets in Nevada as having the potential to be a siren song for businesses contemplating a state other than Delaware.
Musk and the corporate law world’s current flavor spike centers on controlled companies — companies where one person owns more than 50% of stock. Delaware law is currently seen as being friendlier to shareholders than controllers, and has ruled that some companies for some purposes can be considered controlled even if technically 50% of the stock isn’t held by one person.
That includes Tesla and a massive $50 billion shareholder-approved CEO compensation package for Musk, which the Delaware Chancery Court rejected. (The CEO package case is being appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.)
Delaware lawmakers last week passed legislation to make it more difficult for small investors to challenge decisions made by controllers or powerful shareholders. Opponents called it “a billionaire’s bill.”
Nevada, while it does not have nearly as extensive a corporate law history as Delaware, does have an established statutory environment, according to Edwards, and is already seen as a business friendly state for incorporating.
TripAdvisor, which is moving its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, has acknowledged in filings the legal appeal in Nevada. Specifically, company leadership says it has more protections from legal liability in Nevada than it does in Delaware.
Aguilar as secretary of state, with assistance from Edwards, filed an amicus brief in the TripAdvisor case.
Aguilar says lawyers in that case were attempting to paint Nevada as the “wild wild west” where laws can’t be trusted and aren’t sophisticated enough. Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer publicly said companies that relocate to Nevada are “rolling the dice.”
“It’s not the wild wild west,” Aguilar told the Current. “There is accountability. There are measures to do what is best for shareholders.”
For large corporations, especially publicly traded ones, where to incorporate is a highly complicated decision made in consultation with an army of attorneys, Aguilar continued.
“All the law firms are aware of Nevada. Those movements (like TripAdvisor) are starting to come because attorneys are saying Nevada is sophisticated and does a good job.”
Other companies reportedly considering leaving Delaware include Dropbox and Meta, the parent company of Facebook.
Dalia, a freshman assemblymember, is employed by Meta as lead privacy and product counsel. He told the Current his work “generally centers on enforcement against bad actors using Meta products and Federal Trade Commission compliance” and is “completely unrelated” to the resolution he is sponsoring.
“AJR8 comes out of my earlier legal career advising investors and startups in Silicon Valley, where I saw first-hand how Delaware profited massively from its Court of Chancery,” he added.
That sentiment has been echoed by other supporters of the resolution.
Jeff Saling, co-founder of the nonprofit business incubator StartUpNV and venture capital fund Sierra Angels, jokingly told lawmakers during support testimony of AJR8’s hearing that he is “part of the problem.”
“When founders come to me to ask where to incorporate, I have to say Delaware,” he said. “Whether or not they’ll be able to get funding depends on whether they have a Delaware C corp.”
 Nevada Court of Chancery?

What exactly the dedicated business court greenlit by AJR8 would look like would be decided in a future legislative session, presumably in 2029, the session after voter approval.
Lawmakers on the Assembly Judiciary Committee, noting that Nevada’s existing court system is already strained, raised questions about how a dedicated business court would be funded.
Edwards told lawmakers he believes the additional costs of running a business court would be offset by court filing fees and additional revenue from business recordings, but that the Legislature would ultimately have to decide its structure.
Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch pointed out there are incarcerated people who have been waiting “for years and years” in the court system.
“Can you explain why we are jumping business ahead of our constituents’ needs?” she asked.
Edwards and Dalia argued that a dedicated business court could free up the non-business judges to more expeditiously handle civil and criminal cases, benefitting the judicial system overall. They also expressed their support of additional resources for other aspects of the court system.
Edwards said a large public corporation could close a deal in Delaware in 90 days, but in Nevada could be on hold for years because the average adjudication time for business cases is currently around 1,200 days.
“That’s a real barrier in terms of selecting Nevada,” he added.
Another potential hangup is that AJR8 proposes business court judges be appointed for 6-year terms by the governor from a list of three nominees vetted by a special nominating commission. That’s different from Nevada’s current status quo of electing all judges.
Dalia said that elected benches offer no guarantee that the judge will be an expert or even familiar with business law, creating an efficiency that would be seen unfavorably by businesses and result in longer timelines for cases. He added that, unlike criminal and civil law, business law is not part of the standard curriculum at law school.
In Delaware, judges are appointed for 12-year terms and there is a rigorous process to ensure competence and expertise, said Edwards.
Texas, which is also making a push to establish a business court, is contemplating judges appointed to 2-year terms by the governor. Edwards told the Current that structure could be problematic, especially if Texas were to ever become a swing state as people have long predicted.
“If you’re sued in Texas and politically connected and you don’t like the judge, you can just stall and wait until a new governor can appoint a new judge,” he added.
AJR8’s proposal is more like Delaware than Texas. Edward believes it would be more stable because the special nominating commission would be a mix of lawmakers (the assembly speaker and senate majority leader) and judicial officials (the chief justice of the state supreme court and chief judges of the state’s three most populous district courts).
The Assembly Judiciary Committee took no action on the resolution during its March 3 hearing. On March 25, AJR8 was withdrawn from the committee and placed on the Chief Clerk’s desk. That is typically not a positive sign for a bill or resolution. But proponents are still making the case for why Nevada should try.
“We’re in a period where there’s a lot of discussion around this shift” in corporate law, said Edwards. “It’s my view that Nevada should do things that make sense. You can create infrastructure that will pay for itself and also make things more efficient and draw in more revenue.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/court-money-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-31 09:02:09.885696

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
 










All of data is a story. It's a grandmother, it's a son, it's a story of a community's well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute




Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law that will ban food containing some artificial food dyes from being sold in West Virginia starting on Jan. 1, 2028. (Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill that will ban a list of artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in grocery stores or in school lunches.
Republican lawmakers behind the measure have said the synthetic red, blue, green and yellow dyes are unnecessary and harmful. They’ve linked them to behavioral issues in children.
“West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there’s no better place to lead the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ mission,” Morrisey said March 25. “By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we’re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.”
Several states are considering similar legislation, and West Virginia is the first state to pass a sweeping synthetic food dye ban from grocery stores and school cafeterias.
House Bill 2354 bans the use of seven artificial dyes — Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 — in school meals beginning Aug 1. That will take effect much sooner than the federal ban on Red No. 3 and California’s ban of the other dyes.
The dyes would be prohibited along with the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben, in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2028.
“This extended deadline allows companies ample time to adjust, protecting consumers from price increases,” a news release from the governor’s office said.
The state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure, warning that it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, they said. 
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, maintained that the food industry was using “scare tactics” to fight the bill.
“While there are many steps to take to improve our health outcomes, this bill starts by not allowing manufacturers to choose ‘poison for profit’ in our food supply,” he said. “I applaud the governor for signing the food dye bill into law. The governor believes in the [Make America Healthy Again] movement as I do and we are taking steps to improve the quality of health in West Virginia.”
Last September, California became the first state in the nation to ban food dyes from school meals, snacks and drinks. Titled the California School Food Safety Act, the law takes effect Dec. 31, 2027.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has told food executives that removing artificial food dyes is an urgent priority.
In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that Red No. 3 would be banned from food starting January 2027 and from drugs in January 2028. The Jan. 15 order came one week before President Donald Trump’s inauguration and two weeks before Kennedy’s confirmation hearings in the U.S. Senate. The questioning included dyes and their use in U.S. foods.
“Thank you to the Legislature, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the entire Trump Administration for helping us launch this movement right here in West Virginia,” Morrisey said.

Democrats have introduced a bill to make an income tax exemption on overtime pay permanent. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Democrats in the Alabama House of Representatives have introduced a bill to preserve an income tax exemption on overtime pay that Republicans plan to jettison to pay for a tax cut package that includes a grocery tax reduction.
HB 467, sponsored by House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, would remove a June expiration date from the tax break, approved in 2023, and create a commission to study its economic impact.
“These are hardworking Alabamians that are putting into our economy,” Daniels said at a press conference last week. “These are not handouts. These are dollars that they are earning.”
When approved, the tax break was estimated to cost the Education Trust Fund budget $34 million. But the Alabama Department of Revenue says that the exemption has reduced revenue to the ETF by about $230 million.
Republicans, who hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, have signaled since late last year that they planned to let the exemption lapse. Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, told media in December that the impact to the ETF could be almost $350 million before the exemption is set to expire.
House Republicans last week approved four bills that would cut taxes by $191 million.
The bills include legislation to increase the tax exemption for retirement income and increase the income tax thresholds, along with deductions and child tax credits for households who earn less than $120,000 annually.
Another bill would reduce the state grocery tax from 3% to 2% while also allowing but not requiring cities and counties to reduce their local grocery taxes.
Garrett told his colleagues in the House that reducing taxes on groceries is possible only if the tax break on overtime wages is discontinued.
All the tax breaks that legislators are considering reduce revenues to the ETF. Daniels said letting the overtime tax exemption expire would be a burden.
“We are increasing the taxes of hardworking Alabamians by about $230 million,” he said.
Daniels’ bill retains most of the language regarding the overtime tax exemption that is currently in state statute. The most significant change removes the section in the code that set time limits for the tax break, which was from October 2024 to June this year.
The legislation to exempt wages earned while working overtime was filed as the Republican budget chairs balked at how much the tax break has revenues directed toward the Educational Trust Fund budget.
More than a dozen other House Democrats have signed onto the bill as cosponsors, and Daniels said his proposal has received bipartisan support, including the Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank that focuses on issues within the state.
The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.,, has publicly opposed Daniels’ proposal, arguing that it could benefit highly paid professionals and encourage employers to shift employees to hourly work without paying additional compensation.
According to a blog post, an employer could shift a person earning $50,000 and working 60 hours a week. The employer could offer $13.75 per hour to the same employee and have them work overtime. That would earn the worker an additional $4,000 after taxes without the employer having to pay the worker additional compensation.
“It creates a tax loophole that is ripe for abuse and, even if it could lead to some workers taking home higher after tax income when they work overtime, it does nothing to stop overwork of employees and it just lets employers off the hook when they are asking workers to work excessive hours,” said David Cooper, director of state policy and research at the EPI.
The exemption could also benefit highly paid hourly wage workers, white collar hourly employees such as attorneys or physicians. An example in the post considers a hypothetical CEO who earns a $4,000 hourly wage who then works more than the standard 40 hours, who would then earn even more because of the overtime tax exemption.
But the magnitude of that issue in Alabama is unclear.
“Unfortunately, the information is not reported to the Department by the income range of the person,” wrote Kirk Fulford, deputy director of the Legislative Services Agency Fiscal Division in an emailed statement. “We have no way of knowing that.”
Despite that, Daniels and other Democrats urge their colleagues to consider the overtime tax exemption to the list of proposals.
“It is giving hardworking Alabamians an opportunity to take more of their money home,” Daniels said. “But the dollars that this is returning, that is returning to our economy, is more than paying for itself.”

If you let Alabama voters decide [&#8230;]","Then-Former President Donald Trump speaks at a fundraiser for the Alabama Republican Party on Friday, Aug. 4, 2023 in Montgomery, Alabama. Republicans in Alabama's congressional delegation have embraced or been silent on Trump's tariffs on cars and agricultural products, which could have major effects on the state economy. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)By middle school, we’re all taught that the word “democracy” combines “demos,” the Greek word for people, with “kratos,” meaning rule.
Rule of the people.
That doesn’t describe the government we live under.
Alabamians say they want Medicaid expansion. They don’t seem keen on the state’s effective abortion ban. If you let Alabama voters decide whether the state should have a lottery, odds are that it would pass, and it wouldn’t be close.
None of those initiatives will pass the Legislature anytime soon. State government rests on gerrymandered districts that give party extremists a loud voice in elections. It’s also highly centralized, with state lawmakers handling issues that in other states would be city or county matters. It doubles the influence of special interests. Lawmakers fear the judgment of lobbyists more than the verdicts of voters.
Now look over to the federal side.
It seems reasonable to think that most Alabamians don’t want to make food, clothing or other goods more expensive, as President Donald Trump is doing with his tariffs. Especially when raising the price of imports from Mexico will jack up costs for the state’s automotive industry, a large employer our state leaders allegedly revere (though they seem to despise auto workers getting fresh about pay and overtime).
Or look at farmers. Prices for corn and soybeans, among Alabama’s leading agricultural products, fell 10% after Trump announced his tariffs. And is there a constituency for wiping out healthy food choices for school children?
Then there are the dedicated public servants getting thrown out of work for capricious reasons.
How are our federal representatives handling all this?
Democratic Reps. Terri Sewell and Shomari Figures have gone on record opposing the tariffs. But what about the Republicans who make up 78% of Alabama’s congressional voice?
Rep. Barry Moore likes imports. Specifically, making it easier to import firearms into a state suffering from nation-leading rates of gun violence. But he’s also said he supports tariffs on cars, claiming they will bring jobs back. Which is not how the industry sees this playing out. (Hyundai announced $21 billion in auto manufacturing projects to let Trump think it was a response to his tariffs. In fact, most of that reflects investments made before the trade announcements.)
Rep. Robert Aderholt also supports tariffs. He cheered them as protecting steel and aluminum manufacturing. There were fewer than 1,300 steelworkers in Alabama in 2022. There were nearly 59,000 people working retail sales, who are about to find their jobs a lot more difficult.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville calls Trump, who can’t commit to a single tariff approach, a “master negotiator” and claims tariffs will only bring “a little bit of pain.” Something — he didn’t say what — would be “much much worse” without them.
Sen. Katie Britt calls tariffs a “bargaining chip” with other countries. And if Trump throws Alabama jobs into the pot, she appears to be OK with that.
Rep. Dale Strong is too busy venting about something he heard on NPR to defend the 28,000 men and women in his district at risk of losing their jobs under this administration.
U.S. Reps. Mike Rogers of Saks and Gary Palmer of Hoover haven’t said anything, as far as I can tell. It’s a far cry from 2015, when they were screaming about government overreach after President Barack Obama proposed a plan to cut carbon emissions and let the states figure out how to get there.
In short, our congressional delegation is full of cheerleaders shaking the pom-poms for Team Red as their quarterback leaves the field to set the stands on fire. With you in them.
Alabama leaders neither listen to nor fear the voice of the people. The state has a long history of sending Babbitts and backbenchers to Congress, people less interested in showing leadership than collecting the perks of office and doing what they’re told.
That’s perfect for Trump. Most of our representatives seem happy to be limbs of the president. If that means kicking the state they represent — well, look, that’s what they were told to do. Don’t expect an appendage to talk back.
These tariffs threaten the state economy. And our congressional delegation, for the most part, is vigorously applauding.
That’s not democracy.  We need another Greek word to describe this.
Deilos, according to this biblical website, means “cowardly, timid, or fearful.”
A deilocracy. Rule by cowards.
A system that limits voters’ practical choices means that Alabama politics produce sycophants, not leaders. We get officials who don’t fear voters. And representatives who tell you that losing your job and paying more for groceries is worth it because Trump’s will is all that matters.
It would be nice to see more backbone. More advocacy for the people of the state.
But that’s not the system we live in. That’s democracy.
Deilocracy means we have leaders content to turn Alabama into the president’s doormat.

The Alabama Senate approved SB 200 on March 18. The House approved HB 360 on March 19. Both bills have moved to the opposite chambers for consideration.  States throughout the country have been increasingly using diversion programs for defendants who committed offenses that stem from an underlying issue, such as drug addiction.
Supporters say diversion programs reduce both court and incarceration expenses, as as expenses connected to treatment programs.
Judges can order people to enter diversion programs in collaboration with prosecutors and treatment providers. Courts are also able to offer accountability to ensure defendants are complying with the conditions of the program and track the progress of defendants. Once defendants complete the rehabilitation program, the record for that offense is expunged and removed from their criminal records.
Pretrial diversion programs are effective. And expensive for participants.

Court proceedings will resume oftentimes if a person is unable to complete the treatment program or adhere to the conditions outlined by the judge. Under the bills, district attorneys may also remove people from diversion programs for a good reason.
“Right now, statutorily wise, the only courts that are set up by state statute are drug courts,” said Casey Bates, chief of staff for Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sarah Stewart who is helping to craft the legislation. “A number of different counties have set up mental health courts or veterans courts.”
Many times, diversion programs are not available to people unless they reside in an area that offers one they qualify for.
“We wanted to have a framework in place that is going to address any type of court that will be helpful,” Bates said. “Our goal is to keep people from offending again. We don’t want to send them to prison and then have them come back and reoffend. By setting up the accountability court, that is going to be the umbrella for any of the types of courts that are necessary.”
The bills require the Administrative Office of the Courts to establish a process and set policies  governing diversion programs.
The bills were amended as they went through the legislative process to allow courts to accept people referred by municipal courts within their jurisdiction and any contractor that is part of the program must be certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health.

(Arielle Robinson / Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Seven Tulane University students who participated in a protest demanding the release of pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention could face consequences from school administrators.
The students are alleged to have committed conduct violations and face a series of administrative hearings, students and their supporters said at a news conference last week.
They believe Tulane administrators are targeting them after a March 11 protest that was held off-campus near Tulane and Loyola University, where activists called on the schools to not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to make the schools sanctuaries for immigrant students, faculty and staff. The calls came after Khalil, a pro-Palestine protester and former Columbia University student, was arrested at his university apartment and sent to Jena, Louisiana, to await deportation.
“[Tulane] will suppress anyone who dares to exercise their First Amendment right to condemn them,” Tulane student Cameron McLaren said at the press conference.

This latest crop of disciplinary measures from Tulane is part of a nationwide wave of discipline that student activists have been met with for their pro-Palestine activism. Student organizers from Tulane and Loyola still face discipline, including semester-long suspensions, from the encampment or other pro-Palestine-related activism.
According to emails sent to two of those students and reviewed by Verite News, Tulane investigators contend that the students are associated with a group called Tulane Students for a Democratic Society. The group was suspended as a student organization by the university last year over a different unauthorized pro-Palestine protest and is currently forbidden from operating on campus.
The group, which now calls itself Together United Students for a Democratic Society, said in response in an Instagram post that the university is repressing students who are exercising their right to freedom of speech. The group now operates off-campus under a different name, though it continues to use a logo in university colors that is identical to the one it used when it was recognized by the university.
University spokesperson Michael Strecker declined to comment on the individual student conduct charges, noting that the code of conduct applies to student actions on and off campus.
“We fundamentally respect the right to protest,” Strecker said. “However, students may be held accountable for behavior if it violates university conduct policies.”
The students deny the university’s accusations, pointing out that the group has changed its name, met off-campus and didn’t hold the March 11 protest on school property.
Atticus Pratt, one of the students involved, is facing a probe called a “major matter investigation” that could lead to suspension or expulsion. Pratt said they had faced conduct charges before for their activism.
“They want to suspend students so we can’t go on campus and we can’t organize,” Pratt told Verite News. “They want to scare us out of continuing to organize. They want to make other people known that there will be consequences for joining an organization like SDS, or for attending an off-campus protest.”
Adelaide Ritzman, another student facing conduct charges, said they believe the university is violating the First Amendment rights of students who participate in such protests.
“Tulane is trying to figure out who they can scapegoat and who they can kind of make an example of,” Ritzman said.
New Orleans-area First Amendment attorney William Most, whose law firm has been involved in some of the legal matters surrounding protests at Tulane, agrees.
“Tulane may have violated federal law in its drastically harsher treatment of pro-Palestine students as compared to other students for comparable conduct,” Most said in statement to Verite News. “And [Tulane’s police department] in particular may have violated the First Amendment in its crackdown on students based on the content of their speech.”
As the Trump administration targets immigrant students and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education, some Tulane students say the school is cracking down on student speech beyond just protests.
McLaren, another one of the seven students facing discipline, said she was arrested and briefly detained earlier this month after briefly leaving her backpack unattended in the Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life, which resulted in the evacuation of the building.
McLaren spoke up at the press conference publicizing the disciplinary allegations. She said she was walking around campus with a sign on her backpack that criticized the university’s decision to get rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion office and encouraged people not to attend Tulane because of it.
The note read: “Tulane just got rid of DEI…if you have the means, go elsewhere,” according to the Tulane Hullabaloo.
Strecker said McLaren was neither arrested nor charged.
According to Strecker, Tulane police were made aware of an abandoned backpack that had a note attached to it left on the Lavin-Bernick Center’s second floor. The university said the building was quickly evacuated due to safety concerns. University police immediately responded, investigated the event and eventually found that the backpack posed no threat and normal operations resumed after the location was deemed safe, the spokesperson said.
Tulane crime logs show that a “suspicious package” was reported in the building and that the case was closed with no further action being taken. The same website says that this term means that no further investigative action is needed.
McLaren declined further interview requests, but said in an email to Verite News that her “arrest and conduct charges are clearly politically motivated. I did not break any laws nor did I violate any conduct rules.”

When Bello started out as a housekeeper about four years ago, she said she worked independently and lived in the house where she was employed, an experience she described as isolating. Bello worked from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week, and said she was not allowed to spend time with her family. She also said she was never paid because her employers claimed to use her salary to cover her room and board. 
Bello then worked for a cleaning company where she said she continued to face abuse, like working from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. for a low fixed pay rate and with a lack of access to meals and breaks. Despite these conditions, she said it was an improvement from her previous job. However, when she raised some concerns to her employer, Bello said she was fired. 
“I was unaware of everything, I was unaware of minimum wage, unaware of what I should have been making,” Bello said. 
To address situations like this and other mistreatment domestic workers can face, Sen. Rebecca Saldaña, D-Seattle, introduced Senate Bill 5023, which would allow workers such as nannies, housekeepers, and gardeners to have access to minimum wage and overtime, workers’ compensation, meal and rest breaks, and written work agreements and terminations. 
“I feel like this work is what allows all the rest of us to be able to go to work,” Saldaña said. “[This bill] is making sure that the people that take care of our homes and our families and our children are also able to provide for themselves as well.” 
As it stands, the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, a federal law, excludes domestic, farm, and hospitality workers. Their labor has been devalued because the majority of these workers were people of color, immigrants, and women, said Danielle Alvarado, executive director of Fair Works Center. 
“When you have really entrenched ideas about ‘Is the work important? Is it really work?’ it’s part of how you can end up in a situation where mistreating certain workers and not giving them the same respect that you would give other workers can become normalized,” Alvarado said. 
In 2018, Seattle became the first city in the country to adopt legislation that’s similar to the bill now pending in the Legislature. It was implemented in late 2019. Months later, the pandemic hit and further complicated conditions for domestic workers. 
Alvarado said that the rollout of the Seattle law has helped inform the state bill. Though Bello works in Seattle, she said she previously did not know about the protections in the city law. 
The biggest difference in the state legislation compared to the Seattle policy is that it allows workers to retain personal effects such as legal documents and requires employers to create a written contract with workers. These provisions were added in response to input from workers who said they lacked evidence when verbal agreements weren’t met. 
The bill would also allow workers to file a retaliation claim against their employer with the Department of Labor and Industries. The agency could impose civil penalties up to $1,000 for each employer violation. 
Democrats in the Senate passed the bill on a 29-20 vote earlier this month, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition. If it receives final approval this year, the new protections for workers would take effect July 1, 2026.
Republicans argue that domestic workers are independent contractors who can set their own wages and hours and that the added requirements would create a burden for those hiring the workers.
“If we have all of this bureaucratic red tape that we have to go through, what kind of pressure would that put on others to hire?” said Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, in a floor speech.
Bello ​​takes pride in doing her job. “It’s something beautiful, it’s something that has helped me develop new skills such as being creative and organizing,” she said. 
She hopes others value domestic workers and acknowledge the rights they have both as workers and human beings. 
“We shouldn’t have to get to the point of abuse for our voice to matter, we shouldn’t have to get to the point where something scars us for the rest of our lives for our voice to matter,” Bello said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/housekeeper-cleaning-windows-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 08:09:21.348631

Not all 20-odd million of us, of course: We tend to be politically soporific, occasionally becoming passionate over potholes or maybe a too-short grouper fishing season, but preferring to keep reality at arm’s length. 
Still, something is changing. People are angry, auto-calling their representatives, making signs, demonstrating and showing up at town halls.
  U.S. Rep. Neal Dunn via U.S. House
MAGAs will tell you these are nothing but a bunch of disgruntled Democrats, but I’ll bet cash money a good number of those veterans protesting silently outside Tallahassee City Hall last week usually vote Republican. 
And I’ll bet a decent number, frightened and frustrated over President Musk’s scorched-earth attacks on the Department of Education, NOAA, USAID, etc. (it’s a terrifyingly long list), didn’t vote at all in 2024.
I overheard a couple of them talking about it during a recent town hall in Tallahassee. They both said they didn’t like either candidate: Harris was too pro-Israel, Trump was good at business (highly debatable) but a terrible person, and until now they never really thought it mattered who got elected.
Now they know.
The town hall was organized by the Democratic Party of Leon County, hoping to get our congressman to come and talk to us, his constituents. 
Rep. Neal Dunn was invited. He never even responded. He certainly didn’t show up.
Republicans don’t show up, not any more.
They don’t like getting booed. They don’t like facing outraged citizens.
A few tried holding town halls. Did not go well. But hey, at least they actually held town halls. Nobody’s seen hide nor hair of Florida Republicans. 
Maybe they’re huddled together in an undisclosed location. 
I doubt anyone expected to see either of our senators: Ashley Moody remains a MAGA acolyte, while Rick Scott held a telephone town hall once, but that was back during the pandemic.
Invisibility
Lawmaker invisibility hasn’t stopped constituents from arranging meetings and imploring these politicians — who allegedly work for them — to come and listen. 
Tampa Bay voters put on a town hall in Clearwater on March 15 in Rep. Anna Paulina Luna’s district.
  Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, via U.S. House
She was, unsurprisingly, absent. Undeterred, a large crowd addressed a cut-out of her.
Some told the cardboard Luna they feared DOGE would wreck Social Security.
One lady, whose husband was fired from the U.S. Geological Survey in DOGE’s senseless purges, said, “I’ve called and I have emailed and heard nothing from you.”
Maybe Luna’s too busy lobbying to carve Trump’s face on Mt. Rushmore.
Luna doesn’t support Ukraine, and pitched a little hissy fit when Democrats waved the blue and yellow flag in the House, snapping, “Put those damn flags away!” 
But by God, she’s determined to get to the bottom of the great JFK assassination cover-up, demanding the doctors who treated JFK in Dallas and members of the Warren Commission who investigated it appear before Congress. 
Unfortunately for her and for the CIA/Cuba/KGB/Space Aliens conspiracy theorists, all those people are quite dead. 
No-show
Neal Dunn, last week’s no-show, is a urologist from Panama City and is, like Luna, one of the state’s least impressive members of Congress.  
He’s done absolutely nothing of note, unless you count his proposed resolution to “Protect American Businesses from Onerous Refrigeration Regulations.”
You’d think he might have bothered to attend a room of 500+ voters, eager to hear from him. 
It wouldn’t have been much of an inconvenience, either: According to his website, he was in Tallahassee that morning, hosting an event for young people who might want to attend one of the service academies. 
That event ended at 11 a.m.; the town hall started at 11 a.m.; the distance from City Hall to the American Legion Hall is 1.8 miles.
It would have taken him a solid five or six minutes to drive there.
Concerns
The standing-room-only audience created a list of what they’d like to talk about: the unelected Musk, DOGE’s trashing of government services, Ukraine, health care, reproductive rights, our endangered planet, our endangered entitlement programs, and our endangered democracy. 
A panel of worthies, including a county commissioner, a city commissioner, legendary activist Karen Woodall, and former Democratic congressman Alan Boyd, tried to address people’s issues. 
It wasn’t smooth sailing.   
Many were thoroughly annoyed with the good souls on the panel as well as the minority party in Washington. 
Democrats are good at lamenting, hand-wringing, and doom-predicting — all reasonable responses to the atrocities visited upon the country by President Musk and his henchpersons.
They just don’t seem to have much in the way of answers.
One guy stood up and yelled, “What’s the solution? I think we know the problem!”
Attack on universities
Sentient Americans understand the United States is being dismantled, hurled into a Dumpster, and set on fire. 
Rep. Dunn’s district contains six institutions of higher education. All receive federal funds. 
If DOGE gets its way and slashes the budgets of the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, what will become of research at FSU, FAMU, and other colleges and universities? 
FSU alone could lose $65 million. 
That would be a direct hit on the College of Medicine, all the science departments, and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory — the largest and most important magnet lab in the world. 
It conducts experiments in (among other things) superconductivity, critical to efficient and sustainable energy sources. 
If that money goes away, it won’t just be scientific research that suffers: There will be a knock-on effect, harming the whole university. 
The best professors will leave; the best students won’t enroll; lots of people will be laid off.
What will happen to the hundreds of federal jobs at Tyndall Air Force Base at the western end of Rep. Dunn’s territory? How about the USDA Farm Service office in Madison at the eastern end?
Florida is home to 100,000 federal employees, most of them represented by Republicans. 
How about DOGE’s decimating NOAA and the National Weather Service? Florida’s entire Democratic congressional delegation warned that this was a Very Bad Idea.
No Republicans signed onto their letter.
Remember Michael?
Maybe Dunn thinks Florida doesn’t need hurricane forecasters; maybe he’s forgotten what Hurricane Michael did to his district in 2018. 
Without NWS it would have been even worse.

What would Dunn — or any of Florida’s senators and representatives— say to the 400 statewide who’ve lost their jobs with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service? Or the untold numbers who’ll soon be sacked by the Veterans Administration?
Dunn is a veteran himself, but he’s pretty offhand about their concerns. It’s only 20 “in the region” (whatever than means — VA jobs, maybe?
“This is not a massacre,” he said.
Maybe not to him, but the veterans protesting outside his recent event at Gulf Coast State College weren’t impressed: “There’s nowhere in the Constitution that what is going on with DOGE and Elon Musk is appropriate,” one told WJHG TV.
That’s putting it mildly.
But the Constitution doesn’t seem to matter to DOGE, President Musk, Trump, or the Republican-controlled Congress.
Maybe it will mean something to the Supreme Court.
What do you say, Rep. Dunn?

Transparency and accountability are the answer.
The Employer Price Transparency Study – Round 5, conducted by RAND, has consistently  shown that Indiana’s hospital prices are among the highest in the nation, ranking 8th overall. Hoosier employers and employees are paying nearly three times what Medicare pays for the exact same services at the same hospitals — an average of 297% compared to the national average of 254%. This alarming statistic demonstrates a clear need for reform. 
These inflated hospital costs have a direct and negative impact on Indiana’s manufacturing sector. Every dollar spent on excessive health care charges is a dollar that cannot be invested in workforce development, technological advancements, or business expansion. 
In a global marketplace, our ability to compete hinges on our efficiency and our ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce. The current high cost of health care in Indiana makes it more difficult for manufacturers to offer competitive benefits packages and to allocate resources strategically for future growth. 
Since self-funded employers pay directly for their employees’ health care claims, escalating hospital prices translate to immediate and substantial increases in their expenditures. These rising costs force employers to allocate more resources to health care, potentially diverting funds from other critical business areas. Ultimately, the financial burden of high hospital prices significantly affects the sustainability and competitiveness of all employers, but most acutely self-funded insurance models. 
House Bill 1004 takes meaningful steps toward addressing this issue. It introduces measures to increase transparency in hospital pricing and to put pressure on exorbitant costs. For instance, the bill establishes a hospital facility fee excise tax for charges exceeding 265% of  Medicare facility fees.  
Under this legislation, nonprofit hospitals would be mandated to report aggregate data on billed services and their comparison to Medicare reimbursement rates. Nonprofit hospitals charging more than 300% of their modified Medicare reimbursement rate could forfeit their nonprofit status. These provisions are critical for bringing much-needed transparency and  accountability to our health care system.
The passage of HB 1004 is not just about lowering health care costs; it is about strengthening Indiana’s economy and ensuring a prosperous future for our manufacturing industry and its employees. By addressing the issue of high hospital prices, we can free up valuable resources that can be reinvested in our workforce, making Indiana a more attractive place to do business and create jobs.

(Cartoon by Daniel Ackley)Facing down a sea of her own seething constituents in Westfield on Friday, U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz’s town hall descended into a two-hour shouting match just minutes after it began.
Screams from the crowd were nearly constant, often drowning out the Republican representative as she took questions on a range of issues.
Constituents’ fury was wide-ranging: from outrage over inflation, tariffs and the national deficit; to concerns over health care and decreased government services; heated opposition to federal deportation efforts and spending cuts directed by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE); and frustration over President Donald Trump’s response to the Signal scandal at the U.S. Department of Defense.
“You work for us!” 
“We don’t trust you!”
“You’re a f****** liar!” 
“You’re not listening to us!”

Spartz, a third-term federal lawmaker who represents Indiana’s 5th Congressional District north of Indianapolis, struggled for nearly two hours to speak over the yells and boos.
And she isn’t the only Indiana public official being criticized for access, or a lack thereof. Examples abound, from Attorney General Todd Rokita to state lawmakers and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith.
Spartz’s event came shortly after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson advised Republicans to avoid town halls which have been attracting vocal critics of actions by Trump and Musk, who is leading an effort to ferret out waste and fraud that has included firing federal employees, halting some government payments and uprooting programs.
Spartz, however, did not heed that warning and faced hundreds of angry — often hostile — Hoosiers at town halls on Friday and Saturday, the latter held in Muncie.
She threatened at several points during the town halls to stop hosting such events, but repeatedly asserted her desire “to hear all sides” from “everyone in my district.”
“You don’t have to scream,” Spartz told Friday’s crowd in Westfield. “I’m glad that we have people that came here — and I understand your frustration. … That’s why I have these town halls. We want to have these conversations. But if people just come here because they want to scream, it’s not productive.” 










We want to have these conversations. But if people just come here because they want to scream, it’s not productive.


– Republican U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz


Some of Spartz’s GOP colleagues have been less inclined.
Republican U.S. Senators Jim Banks and Todd Young, as well as Reps. Mark Messmer and Marlin Stutzman, are among those being criticized for not holding or attending town halls. 
Banks, specifically, ignited a political backlash last week after he skipped a constituent-led “Empty Chair Town Hall” and instead sent donuts — a move critics called “a dismissive stunt.”
“The idea of people having access to government in a variety of ways is foundational to American representative democracy. On one hand, it shouldn’t have to be required — it should just go without saying that in a representative form of government law, public officials should speak to the people who put them in office,” said Gerry Lanosga, professor of journalism at Indiana University and board member for the Indiana Coalition for Open Government. 
“What we’re kind of seeing now is partly pushed by officials who get into office and just don’t want to engage with citizens more than beyond the ballot box,” he continued. “I think it’s a real concern. And I think it’s a real sort of black eye on American democracy if public officials want to insulate themselves from the voices of people.”
‘Chaotic,’ ‘frustrating’ town halls
During the weekend town halls, Spartz emphasized that her office “has an open door policy” and “wants to hear from you all.”
In Westfield, multiple constituents pushed back: “You never respond!” some said. Others left angrily in the middle of the event, shouting that Spartz “doesn’t actually want to hear from you — she doesn’t care what you think!”
In a post to X on Saturday, Spartz rebutted. 
“I don’t think (the) radical left has learned yet that shouting and screaming is not going to work — no one is going to be intimidated,” she wrote. “I still appreciate everyone who came to my town halls this week & hope at least some on the left were able to hear common sense policies we are trying to implement benefiting all Americans.”

Elsewhere in recent weeks, other members of Indiana’s congressional delegation have been absent from “empty chair” town halls across the state.
One of those hosted last week by Indivisible Northeast Indiana — part of a progressive national movement to “mobilize local activists to resist extremist polices” — drew hundreds to the Allen County Public Library in Fort Wayne.
Indiana House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta and state Rep. Kyle Miller, both Democrats, took the stage to answer questions from the public. Three of Indiana’s Republican congressional lawmakers — Banks, Stutzman and Young — were represented by empty chairs.
Banks, Indiana’s junior U.S. senator, instead sent donuts to the crowd.
He said on X that the Indivisible group consists of Democrats who are “anti-Trump/Banks,” and that town hall attendees seemed “really angry.”
“So I sent my favorite donuts hoping to lighten the mood,” Banks said.
A video about the donut delivery showed some at the event laughing and eating the donuts. Others weren’t so receptive.
“I’m going to throw up on them,” said one attendee. Another asked, “Why isn’t he here?” referring to Banks, while a third man said, “Tell him to go to hell.”
Jim Carpenter, co-founder of Indivisible Northeast Indiana, said in a statement that “the parlor trick of offering donuts” was “a waste of taxpayer money” and “ironic coming from someone pledging to eliminate fraud and waste in the federal government.”
When asked about the town halls, Banks’s staff gave the Indiana Capital Chronicle a single response: “No taxpayer dollars were used to purchase donuts.”

— Senator Jim Banks (@SenatorBanks) March 22, 2025

Young, separately, had met with the Indivisible group following a protest in front of his office.
A spokesperson for the senator told the Capital Chronicle that he “regularly meets with Hoosiers in a variety of formats, including attending meetings and events across Indiana, hosting constituent coffees, and holding virtual meetings with Hoosier groups when the Senate is in session.” Additionally, Young’s staff “meets with individuals and groups in all 92 counties.”
In Evansville, hundreds of protesters gathered earlier this month in “frustration” over refusals by Messmer, Indiana’s 8th District representative, to hold a town hall or engage with constituent concerns.
Hoosiers also pushed back after staff for U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin, who represents Indiana’s 9th Congressional District, “put a pause” on regularly scheduled office hours with constituents in Bedford.
Democratic officials have been more willing to continue town halls.
Rep. André Carson, whose district encompasses most of Indianapolis, hosted an hour-long virtual conversation last week, where he largely fielded questions about DOGE cuts. 
First Congressional District Rep. Frank Mrvan, a Democrat from Highland, held a similar remote town hall in early March.
State officials face scrutiny, too
At the state level, Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith said he also remains committed to meeting face-to-face with Hoosiers.
Ahead of his Monday town hall in Franklin, Beckwith made clear in a post to X that, “I think going out into communities and having conversations is such an important part of being in public office.”
Even so, constituents are barred from responding to the lieutenant governor’s posts on the social media site.
Beckwith’s staff have previously suggested that “security” concerns prompted tighter interaction restrictions on X, and said the office’s social media accounts — along with the accounts for the two agencies that report to the lieutenant governor — are monitored by his team “in an effort to inform the public about activities and events.”
They cited the office’s social media policy, which states that “the focus of the social networking opportunities is to share information” about the agencies, while “larger discussions of political views and philosophies may be addressed elsewhere.”

Beckwith’s personal X account alternatively permits anyone to comment and reply on posts, for example.
Such limitations were not in place on social media accounts held by former Republican Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, nor are those restrictions in place Gov. Mike Braun’s official account.
The Capital Chronicle also received complaints from constituents who encountered issues when trying to contact the Indiana Attorney General’s Office by phone or email.
Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita maintained that Hoosiers have “unprecedented access to his office” but said staff are sometimes “bombarded, and we have overflow.”
“If a number is left, we call it back, for sure,” Rokita said about phone calls to the state agency. He noted that his office has “several full-time employee-equivalents” whose jobs are dedicated to “consumer outreach.”

Rokita referenced his “Eyes on Education Portal,” which at times has flooded and even “overwhelmed” the office with messages in “short period(s) of time.”
He also pointed to the agency’s employee handbook, which requires that “all phone calls, all emails — any contact — is to be returned in 24 business hours.”
“And if that doesn’t happen, there are consequences. It doesn’t happen often, but I executed one of those consequences a couple weeks ago, and I’m just sad to hear something like that. But if it’s a pattern, I promise I’ll get to the bottom of it,” Rokita said. “I pride myself on accessibility.”
Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray further held that it’s “super important” for state lawmakers to remain open and accessible to Hoosiers.
That “can be challenging,” though, during the legislative session.
“We’re super busy. I go, like everybody else, to at least one town hall … during the weekends, on Friday or Saturday. And most of mine this year have been pretty full and kind of robust conversations, which I really, really enjoy,” Bray said. “And I try pretty hard to answer emails and phone calls and things like that, but it is difficult to keep up with those because of the pace of session.” 
“Probably not unlike any others, I could stand a little bit of criticism for being slow to get back with people,” he continued. “But the folks’ input is super important. It helps me stay grounded and keeps my ear to the ground. The time I invest in that makes me a much better legislator.”

Lanosga described an “eroding, a kind of shrinking in the ability of people to get their voices heard by government officials, at all levels, from both sides of the aisle,” over the last three decades. Increasingly, he said, “the ears of the representatives or politicians aren’t hearing the voices of the people.”
“I think citizens — if they’re disturbed about lack of engagement or lack of responsiveness of elected officials — should pick up the phone. They should write letters. They can write letters to news media. They can write emails. They can do social media campaigns,” he said. “All of those things should be tools in the arsenal of arguing for these sorts of robust public debates and public discourse.”
While there can be “legitimate reasons” for public officials to limit accessibility — such as for physical safety — Lanosga cautioned that those justifications “can end up really pushing back the boundaries of people’s access to make their voices heard.”
“Citizens can go to meetings that are scheduled of governing bodies. But outside that, government officials don’t really have to talk to you if they don’t want to. I think it’s very serious,” he said. “And so in those circumstances, you’re right to kind of ask, ‘What’s the point of me even raising my voice if no one’s here to listen to it?’ And so that’s kind of the situation we’re getting into. And if people don’t start pushing back against it and reclaiming that territory, it’s really hard to get back.”

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)By the time Joanna Rogers got to give testimony at the Capitol on a bill that could one day help enshrine the right to a healthy and safe climate in Oregon’s Constitution, she and other speakers were told they’d have one, rather than two, minutes to make their case for or against the bill. The 11-year-old from Portland made fast edits to her testimony so she could cut straight to the heart of the matter.
“You are in charge of so many kids’ fates. Please do what you can,” Rogers told the lawmakers.
If passed, Senate Joint Resolution 28 would refer a ballot measure to Oregon voters in November to amend the state constitution so that it guarantees the “inherent, fundamental right to a clean, safe and healthy environment, including but not limited to clean air, clean water, thriving ecosystems and a stable climate system.”
It would make Oregon one of four states to make such a promise to future generations in its guiding legal document and would allow Oregonians to sue the state government and its agencies if it reneges on that promise.
At the first public hearing for the bill Wednesday in the Senate Rules Committee, Rogers was among a crowd so packed with people hoping to give testimony that a second room was opened to accommodate them. More than 170 people submitted written testimony in support of the bill in advance of the hearing and 26 submitted written testimony in opposition.
Those opposed include large trade associations such as the Oregon Farm Bureau, Oregon Business & Industry, Associated Oregon Loggers and home building groups.
“We see this as a pathway to an endless stream of lawsuits against family farms and ranches,” Lauren Kuenzi, a lobbyist for the Oregon Farm Bureau, told lawmakers. “This will put the court in the driver’s seat, allowing them to shape public policy for a lot of industries.”
The bill’s chief sponsor, state Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland, said it would not lead to lawsuits against private parties or individuals.
“The government has a responsibility to uphold constitutional rights. Private interests have no responsibility to uphold constitutional rights,” he explained.
Citizens could sue the Department of State Lands for permitting a new mining operation, but they could not sue the mining company under the amendment.
Sharla Moffett, a lobbyist for Oregon Business & Industry, expressed concern that it would raise environmental rights to the same level as the right to due process and equal protection under the Oregon Constitution, without clarifying what all those rights entail.
“The terms ‘clean air,’ ‘clean water,’ ‘thriving ecosystems’ and ‘a stable climate’ could be highly subjective and are not defined in the bill,” Moffett said.
The bill is cosponsored by state Sens. James Manning Jr., D-Eugene, Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, and Reps. Tom Andersen, D-Salem, Thủy Trần, D-Portland, and Mark Gamba, D-Milwaukie.
Gamba, who tried to suppress tears as he gave testimony, described the need for the Legislature to meet climate change “as the existential threat that it is.” He said suing corporations over the environmental harm they’ve caused has proven to be extraordinarily difficult. But holding Oregon’s government accountable into the future could offer options.
“It’s a clever idea. It’s a bold idea. It allows voters to put an environmental rights amendment into our constitution and reclaim some of our power to stand up to big polluters,” Gamba said to applause in the hearing.
Among those in attendance was Miko Vergun, a 22-year-old plaintiff in the landmark youth climate case Juliana v. United States, filed a decade ago in U.S. District Court in Eugene against the federal government by 11 young Oregonians and 10 peers from several states.
The case, which attempted to hold the U.S. government accountable for accelerating global climate change through lawmakers’ policies and fossil fuel subsidies, never got a trial. It recently hit a dead end after the Supreme Court declined a petition from the plaintiffs to throw out a lower court’s decision to dismiss the case.
Vergun told the senators things might have been different if the state had guaranteed a constitutional right to a healthy climate for her and other young Oregonians.
“In states like Montana and Hawaii, young people like me have won their cases because their constitutions explicitly protect the right to a healthy environment. That’s why SJR 28 matters. It would give Oregonians the same chance to be heard and protected,” she said.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
The low, rock-covered berm juts like a crooked finger into the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. It doesn’t look like much now. When finished, though, this and other marine construction work under way in South Baltimore will become 10 acres of wetlands in a city desperately short of natural shoreline.
Roughly three quarters of Baltimore’s waterfront is lined with bulkheads, piers and brick promenades, hardening that severely limits habitat for waterfowl, fish and crabs. The Hanover Street project is the opening salvo in an ambitious effort to restore more than 50 acres of wetlands along 11 miles of shoreline in the long-neglected southern part of the city.
“A year from now, you’ll see a … freshly planted wetland that extends far out into the water,” said Brad Rogers, executive director of the South Baltimore Gateway Partnership. In league with the city and another nonprofit group, Parks and People Foundation, Rogers’ group is spearheading the restoration effort.
The Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, as it’s called, aims to protect disadvantaged communities in South Baltimore from increasingly frequent flooding and improve water quality there while also providing residents better access to the waterfront.
The initiative is part of a more expansive plan called Reimagine Middle Branch, a community-driven environmental justice movement to enhance the 19 neighborhoods in the area and reconnect them to the shoreline they’ve been cut off from for so long. The vision, Rogers said, is to transform what’s been called Baltimore’s forgotten waterfront into Baltimore’s next great waterfront.
For as long as anyone can remember, the Middle Branch’s shores have suffered from erosion, ship-channel dredging and filling of wetlands. People passing by on busy Hanover Street couldn’t even see the water because their view was blocked by a forest of phragmites.

“It used to be this wide open, deltaic environment with reeds and birds,” Rogers explained as he walked along the rocky berm under construction in the river.
Now, the invasive plants crowding the water’s edge have been removed. The berm, once finished, is to be topped with a layer of sand and organic material, into which wetlands vegetation will be planted. The berm and its plants will help dampen wave-driven erosion from storms and nuisance flooding, protecting a vital traffic artery. Gaps left in the offshore structure will provide access to quieter near-shore water for fish and waterfowl.
For the time being, a floating yellow boom stretches out from the shoreline encompassing the area undergoing a nature makeover. But even before the first blade of marsh grass gets planted, the project is drawing a crowd — of birds and fish.
“You put in this boom and suddenly you see herons, cormorants and menhaden along the shore,” Rogers said.
The Hanover Street wetland is expected to be completed later this year even as construction is planned to start on three other projects. Next up is rehabilitation of a 9-acre patch of marsh between two streets that parallel the river.
“What we’re doing is restoring [its] connectivity to the Patapsco and restoring it as a more ecologically functional marsh as opposed to wet soils and phragmites,” Rogers said.
After that, wetlands are to be added along the shore by Medstar Harbor Hospital, where flooding-aggravated erosion threatens the Middle Branch Trail along the waterfront and is crumbling three concrete piers standing forlornly in the water.
“We want to be able to expand and enhance that and make it a much more attractive place to spend time,” Rogers said.
More wetlands are planned along a tract known as Spring Gardens, the ironically named site of a BGE liquefied natural gas tank farm. The final project would restore woods and marsh at Smith Cove, where two stormwater outfalls now dump runoff from the developed uplands. A boardwalk and environmental education center are also planned there to connect with a new half-mile long waterfront park in Westport.
The waterfront park is to be built in conjunction with a new housing, office and retail complex, One Westport, the first phase of which began construction last year on a 43-acre swath of waterfront that’s sat barren for decades awaiting redevelopment. A coal-burning power plant once occupied part of the site, and an unknown quantity of potentially toxic ash from the facility was buried at a spot now largely paved over, according to an inventory of coal ash disposal sites.

“For the first time in history,” Rogers said, Westport residents “will have access to their own waterfront.”
Unlike many previous urban redevelopment efforts, under Reimagine Middle Branch, the South Baltimore group has worked with leaders and residents of the area’s neighborhoods to plan the Westport park’s amenities, including a playground, outdoor gathering space, kayak launch and a memorial to the Black Sox Negro League baseball team.
“We’re not telling them how they want to develop, and we’re not telling them what kind of investment they’re looking for,” said Rogers. “We’re helping them choose.”
In conjunction with the physical upgrades, the partnership also has sponsored a series of activities and events, including boat cruises in warm weather and ice skating in winter, to encourage residents to come to and reclaim their waterfront.
The partnership has raised about $67 million just for the shoreline restoration work, with much more to be lined up for the Westport park and other elements of Reimagine Middle Branch.
About $40 million of the funds provided so far came from federal agencies. With the Trump administration trying to freeze or cancel many grants and Congress looking to slash spending overall, it’s unclear how much more federal financial support can be counted on.
“It is a time of uncertainty,” Rogers acknowledged, “and everyone involved in environmental restoration or economic development … is going to have to figure out how to be flexible and adaptive.” But the need is so great, he added, “The work can’t be stopped.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/67bf74f5aff91.image1_-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

Our clients frequently receive very long sentences — for defending themselves against abusive partners, acting under coercion or duress from abusive partners, or because they were unable to prevent their abusive partners from hurting their children. In cases involving felony murder and imputed liability, our clients are sentenced as though they were the people who carried out violent crimes, despite never having harmed anyone. Many of our clients are serving life in prison.
Sentenced to long prison terms, our clients use their time in prison as productively as they can — to seek education, engage in programming, and learn skills that make them employment ready. They do so much programming, in fact, that within a few years, there is nothing left for them to take.
Left to age in prison, our clients develop serious (and expensive to treat) medical issues. They grow old in a place that is not designed to meet the needs of the elderly. They are not dangerous. They are not violent.
Our clients use the limited legal options that are available to them to seek review of their sentences. But most of those processes are focused on legal errors, and so don’t take into account a person’s programming, growth, or positive institutional record.
The only pure review option, sentence modification, is severely time limited. Under current law, judges can only modify sentences if asked to do so within 90 days of the original sentence and within five years of the sentencing date. Judges are often disinclined to reconsider sentences that close in time to the original ruling and our clients may not have had time to amass the kind of record that might make a judge reconsider a sentence within that short period.
Opponents of the Second Look Act argue that individuals who have been convicted of crimes of violence — the kinds of crimes that generate long sentences — are the “worst of the worst.” Our clients are far from the worst. They have been convicted of crimes of violence, but they are not violent people. They are mothers and grandmothers, sisters and aunts. They are eager to show their sentencing courts the hard work they have done while incarcerated.
They could be productive members of society if given the opportunity. All they ask is for the chance to make that case in court.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1440229538-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

The bill then stalled on the next step, and a month passed before the House Rules-Legislative Committee approved it for placement on the calendar for debate. Now, as April is about to begin and lawmakers have only seven weeks to complete their work, it is uncertain whether that debate will take place.
The bill has the backing of House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit, but he’s not sure the rest of the GOP caucus is ready to follow him.
“It’s a matter of, do we have a majority of the people in the chamber that feel the same way?” Patterson said Thursday at the weekly House Republican news conference. “That I don’t know.”
For more than five years there have been legislative efforts, ultimately unsuccessful, to expand legal gambling through video lottery games and sports wagering — and to shut down unregulated games offering cash prizes that can be found in bars, truck stops and convenience stores across the state.
The proliferation of what are called gray market machines is one of the best arguments for authorizing video lottery games, Patterson said.
“If people are doing it, I would rather have them regulated and taxed and to make sure that kids aren’t doing it,” he said. “So I’m in favor of the bill itself.”
The legislation sponsored by state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, has been revised since it was introduced and another major revision is awaiting action on the House floor. To win votes, an amendment Hardwick intends to propose would cut the number of machines allowed at each location to eight and add provisions allowing local governments — cities for incorporated areas, counties for unincorporated locations — to conduct votes on whether to allow video lottery terminals.
He also removed all provisions of the bill that would have eliminated the gray market machines. Instead of phasing them out six months after video lottery is launched, retailers could keep them if they prefer rather than become lottery outlets.
They could not have both.
 State Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, speaks March 25 on the Missouri House floor (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Last week, Hardwick had a pad of lined paper in hand, going from member to member on the floor to see if he had enough votes.
“I think that we can pass it out of the House,” Hardwick said. “I think that we should pass it out of the House.”
The best argument he has for the bill, Hardwick said, is its potential to produce revenue for state education programs. Gov. Mike Kehoe didn’t recommend a $300 million increase in the state public school formula that would fully fund the program, calling it too expensive.
According to the fiscal note, video lottery would produce $112 million in the first year and almost $350 million a year when fully operational.
There is a substantial surplus currently in the state general revenue fund, but revenues are not growing and the Republican majority wants to cut state income taxes. 
“A lot of my members are thinking about the fact that the state’s going to have some tough budget times ahead, and by making a few regulatory and structural changes, we could change revenues without raising taxes on people,” Hardwick said.
For several years, the issue of gambling was a triangular debate. 
Casino companies and professional sports teams eager for the revenue from sports wagering opposed the video game vendors pushing for the new form of lottery game. Both were opposed at times by lobbyists for Torch Electronics, the largest of the gray market operators and a prolific political giver.
Torch didn’t want any bill that would make the law clear on the legality of its games.
It has been active both in the legislative halls and the courtroom, where it unsuccessfully sued the Missouri State Highway Patrol to block criminal investigations of its machines. 
A representative of Torch declined to comment on the revised bill.
A campaign organized by major sports teams and bankrolled by online betting platforms in November won approval of sports betting for Missouri. While that issue is off the table, casinos aren’t backing down from their opposition to video lottery games.
The number of people visiting Missouri’s 13 casinos in the final six months of 2024 was down 25% from the same period of 2019, which is about the time the unregulated machines were making their debut. The remaining casino gamblers are each losing more, on average, and net winnings for the casinos have gone up 8% in that same period.
What the figures say is that small-dollar players are choosing to play the unregulated machines, said Michael Winter of the Missouri Gaming Association.
The association considers the unregulated machines to  be criminal gambling devices and the proposal for video lottery to be unconstitutional. The only place slot machines are legal, he said, is in the 13 casinos licensed by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
“I don’t think the market has stopped growing when you look at either illegals or the potential that putting in more slot machines than every location around the state could have on our properties,” Winter said. “So we think there’s still more downside and revenue we could lose if bills like this are passed.” 
The bill’s controls on improper play, such as by people under 21, are too loose, Winter said.
“They don’t have set aside rooms,” he said. “They don’t have licensed personnel overseeing the machine. You’ve got a person at the counter who’s in charge of making sure that only 21-year-olds play the machines.”
The changes in Hardwick’s proposed amendment are essential to winning passage, said Andy Arnold, a lobbyist for J & J Ventures, a vendor for video lottery games.
He thinks a bipartisan majority of the House can be assembled to pass the bill, but it would be close. To get to the Senate, a bill must win 82 votes from the 163-member House.
A provision that requires the games to be in a place “distinct and divided from the primary business operation area” was important to calming fears that minors may be playing the games.
Arnold has been working to get video lottery legalized for 10 years. The arguments from the casinos are more about market share than legality, he said.
“It’s just a matter of time before people see through and see that it’s nothing more than competition,” Arnold said. “They don’t want the competition. But they’ve already got the competition from the illegal machines.”

(Barbara Shelly/for Missouri Independent)Friends and family arrived bearing flowers. Smiling volunteers pointed the way to seats.
Everyone loves a naturalization ceremony. I attended one recently at a branch of the Kansas City Public Library and watched 71 new American citizens swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. Even more immigrants had taken the oath earlier in the day.
“This room is full of the most brilliant minds that the world knows,” Wasim Khan, a cultural leader, told the group. “You guys are the teachers. You know what it takes to be here.”
After the ceremony, as League of Women Voters volunteers swooped in to invite the new citizens to register, I asked a few people how long they have been in America.
Eight years, 12 years, too many years to count.
Naturalized citizenship is a long, expensive process and everyone who achieves it does so through a combination of grit and good fortune.
I’ve attended several of these ceremonies over the years to cheer on people I’ve had the privilege to know.
One was a piano teacher who came here from Kyrgyzstan to study at American universities. Several others arrived as refugees. They overcame language barriers and all the hardships of poverty to arrive at their naturalization ceremonies as educated, hardworking contributors to their communities.
The recent ceremony was no different from others I’ve witnessed, but I couldn’t summon the usual measure of joy.
Rather, I kept wondering what a naturalization ceremony will look like once the xenophobic policies of the Trump administration have been fully brought to bear.
Last year, I signed up to participate on a team that would sponsor a refugee family, in cooperation with a resettlement agency. I told myself that it would be a satisfying act of resistance in case Donald J. Trump won the presidency.
Along with others, I welcomed a family of eight at Kansas City’s airport on a snowy evening 12 days before Trump’s inauguration. They were exhausted and one person was ill but they were here and we were ready to introduce them to America.
We had no idea how difficult that was going to be.
Within a week of taking office, Trump had slammed the door to new refugee admissions and cut off funding for the families who had recently arrived.
The resettlement community had anticipated the first move. It was gobsmacked by the second. With an executive order, Trump wiped out money that was supposed to pay for rent and utilities, medical screenings and other services for hundreds of people who had entered the United States legally in the last 90 days.
Agencies went into emergency fundraising mode, but Trump’s action was crippling. The agency I volunteer for lost nearly $1 million of federal money it had counted on. Part of that amount was already spent in rent deposits and other costs.
It’s nearly impossible to cover a gap like that through donations. Within weeks two agencies in Kansas City laid off close to half their staffs. A smaller nonprofit laid off its entire refugee services staff. A mid-Missouri agency shut down its resettlement program.
My role in the resistance now includes scanning job ads for something that might work for adults who speak only a little English and will have to ride to work on the bus. I’ve become familiar with the difficulties of booking an appointment at the local Social Security office — and good luck once Elon Musk gets through with that program.
The family that my team works with was routed from their ancestral home and spent years in limbo in a neighboring country. The adults are fully aware that the leader of the United States does not want them here.
Their status is legal, but they are afraid. They grieve family members left behind in a refugee camp, clinging to hopes of a reunion that may not happen in this lifetime.
In my head, I construct sentences that begin with “at least.”
At least they aren’t here on humanitarian parole status — a category of immigrants more endangered than refugees.
At least they have a place to stay, a small rental house in a hollowed-out part of Kansas City. A recent New York Times story reported on newly arrived refugees in St. Louis languishing in motels on highway interchanges because the resettlement agency there was unable to pay apartment leases.
At least members of my family have friends. Immigrants from their home country have sought them out and embraced them.
The situation could always be worse. But it is bad enough.
Refugee resettlement is a way of participating in the global good. Therefore, it is not a priority in Trump’s “America First” agenda.
The immigrants whom I witnessed as they became naturalized citizens last month represented 36 nations, including some of the most troubled, like Haiti, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They had cleared a high bar to get to the ceremony. All of them passed a civics test that most Americans would find daunting. They were deemed to be of “good moral character,” a standard that we don’t necessarily demand from our nation’s leaders.
Congratulations to the new Americans. May we always find a path for them.

From left to right are reporter Mia Maldonado, editor-in-chief Christina Lords, reporter Kyle Pfannenstiel and senior reporter Clark Corbin. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The first conversation I had with Andrea Verykoukis, I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of a Boise Eyemart Express with my cellphone on speakerphone on a cloudy day in late January 2021.
I had just gotten out of an eye appointment, having picked out a new set of blue, thick-rimmed glasses. That’s because, two days before, I had just been fired from the Idaho Statesman and needed to renew my prescription before I lost my health insurance. (If you don’t know that story, maybe I’ll tell it to you over a beer someday; if you do, know I am still a fierce Excel advocate and an advocate for making sure our reporters have the tools they need to do their jobs.)
Andrea, along with Chris Fitzsimon and a host of other talented journalists, had been hard at work launching or partnering with nonprofit news organizations focused on state politics and policy in all 50 states through States Newsroom, now the Idaho Capital Sun’s parent nonprofit and the reason our outlet exists.
I have to be honest here. After the firing, and after 12 years of journalism — 11 of them at newspapers in Idaho — I wanted out. I was looking at master’s programs to go be the librarian my mom always thought I should be and applying to public relations jobs I thought might fit.
But Andrea asked one question: What is going under covered and under reported in Idaho? And then she went quiet.
I think I rambled on for about 30 straight minutes about how public education has been chronically underfunded and our educators have been demoralized here, about how the shortages our health care workforce we faced even before COVID were in dire straights now, about how wildfire and mismanagement of federal public lands was threatening the places I grew up visiting, about how the Idaho Legislature every year comes with legislation to make it harder for Idahoans to cast a ballot or run a citizens initiative in our elections.
And I’ll never forget what Andrea said: “Well. It sure seems like you have more stories in you to tell. What do you think about launching a nonprofit focused on state politics in Idaho through States Newsroom?”
Then she explained that as a nonprofit news organization, States Newsroom allows any other media outlet to pick up our work — for free — with proper credit and attribution.
I thought of all the times sitting around the conference room at my first reporting gig covering local government and crime at the Moscow-Pullman Daily News and praying that larger news organizations could report on some of the tips and stories that we just couldn’t get to with our small, young staff. Of all the times I had to say no to stories worth pursuing at the Post Register in Idaho Falls as I stumbled my way through my first legislative session in 2013 because there just weren’t enough reporters to get them all done. And of all the times at the Idaho Press when I was assistant editor where we lost good, young reporters that we had spent years building up their reporting chops, figuring out complex local government systems and backstories, just to see them forced to take a PR job because journalism wasn’t paying their bills.
If we could help other Idaho newsrooms — and by extension, their Idaho readers — by providing in-depth coverage of the Statehouse, maybe, I thought, we could make an impact.
I took a week to talk myself out of it. I dove alone to Balanced Rock in Twin Falls County to explore somewhere I had never been in Idaho, to hike, to watch Salmon Falls Creek sweep by me, to see our farm fields laid out as far as the eye could see, to think. It was there I decided there was some journalism still left in me, and I was compelled to try.

I thought for sure we’d launch the Idaho Capital Sun, it wouldn’t work, and in a year say, well, we tried.
But that’s not what happened.
While Idaho newsrooms are very competitive and want to be first, right and contextual, they also understand Idahoans have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent, and who is making the decisions that affects their daily lives and their futures.
The very first newsroom to pick up one of our stories, on the first day we launched, March 31, 2021 — four years ago today? The Idaho Statesman.
But it certainly wasn’t the last. To States Newsroom, the measure of our success isn’t tallied by click quotas for reporters or page view website traffic. It’s how many of our stories are good enough and helpful enough to be picked up by other newsrooms, so we track those metrics instead.
Just this month, the Idaho Capital Sun’s stories were picked up online by other news outlets 240 times, largely in Idaho but some also nationwide. And 62 of our stories this month have made it into print. And that’s just what we can monitor and categorize, likely a huge undercount of just how far our work travels.
Our work is picked up everywhere by the fine folks at the the weekly Sandpoint Reader to my hometown TV news station KPVI in Pocatello. By the Rexburg Standard Journal, by the ever-expanding BoiseDev online, by the Twin Falls Times-News and by another newspaper I called home for four years, the Idaho Press in Nampa. The Idaho Capital Free Press picks up our work in Grangeville, and so does the News-Examiner for their readers in Bear Lake and Caribou counties. Our work traveled across the country this month in publications like USA Today; the Adirondack Daily Enterprise in Saranac Lake, New York; Spokane Public Radio; and the Fox 26 TV station in Medford, Oregon.
And we return the favor. At the bottom of every one of our newsletters, the Sunrise, which you can sign up for online for free, I include a collection of links to the work of other Idaho news outlets the produce every day. I think a lot about our state’s news ecosystem, and we aim to bring to the forefront the hard work, under tough economic and political circumstances, that reporters are providing to the Gem State and her residents.
As I mentioned before, the Idaho Capital Sun is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so donations from readers like you are what keep our lights on. It’s what keeps not only our readers informed at IdahoCapitalSun.com, but it also keeps the tens of thousands of readers of other hardworking Idaho news organizations informed, too.

Now, among the most chaotic and challenging news cycle and political climates I have ever faced in the 16 years I’ve been a professional journalist, I’m reminded every day just how essential our role is to meeting this moment. Because we have reporters originally born and raised here or who have lived here for decades, I’ve never felt more capable of reflecting the things Idahoans experience and want to know about in our work. I’ve never felt more “sure in my skis,” as they say, never been more confident in our ability to make change and help people understand their world around them.
If you’ve ever sent a note of encouragement or supported us financially over the last four years, through donations large or small, one-time or recurring, thank you for helping us grow and thrive. You are the reason we are celebrating our fourth anniversary today. If you’re new to the Idaho Capital Sun and our work, welcome. We hope you find value in what we do here.
And especially to our hard working reporting staff, Mia Maldonado, Kyle Pfannenstiel and Clark Corbin, our senior reporter who has been with us since the day we launched, thank you for waking up every day and fearlessly heading into spaces to shine the light of truth. I’m the luckiest editor in Idaho to work with people like you.

Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments, the author writes. (Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)By Patrick DiRoma, co-founder of Bergen County Complete Streets
Three months into the long-awaited congestion pricing program, the signs are clear: congestion pricing works.
The policy is doing what no amount of roadway expansions have managed to achieve – significantly reducing travel times, saving residents valuable time that they would rather spend doing anything other than sitting in traffic. And unlike adding more car lanes, as the proposed New Jersey Turnpike expansion would do, it is creating healthier and safer places to live, work, and play.
Drivers and bus riders are seeing first-hand the benefits of reduced traffic as a result of congestion pricing, particularly near the bridges and tunnels that connect New Jersey to Manhattan.
Meanwhile, Gov. Phil Murphy and other New Jersey representatives are continuing to waste time and money attacking congestion pricing when they should be focused on improving the Garden State’s own transportation system. Their attempts to sue New York over this policy sent a clear message: They would rather maintain a broken status quo instead of providing high-quality public transit improvements that meet the transportation needs of hard-working New Jersey residents.
Such improvements would reduce the number of cars on the road, shorten commutes, improve air quality, and create opportunities to use space in ways that best serve people rather than vehicles. Congestion pricing is a policy that is actually addressing this problem head-on and New Jersey should be learning from it, not fighting it.
New Jersey deserves to have convenient, high-quality, and reliable transportation options and safer, cleaner streets, and that means investing in infrastructure that provides alternatives to driving, something that every administration in my lifetime has failed to deliver.
In pursuit of this goal, New Jersey can start by creating dedicated bus lanes on the George Washington Bridge. This can be implemented quickly and at minimal cost by partnering with New York. It would allow 10 times as many people to get across the bridge as compared to a regular vehicle lane; high-capacity buses would no longer be stuck in the same traffic as cars.
The state can also expedite the extension of the Hudson-Bergen light rail to Bergen County, which both the Bergen County executive and county commissioners support. Other states have expedited transit projects through targeted exemptions from environmental impact studies. Given the overwhelming environmental benefits of public transit, New Jersey should be doing the same.
Finally, New Jersey residents need access to safe infrastructure for growing micro-mobility. Many residents already use devices like scooters and bikes for last-mile access to our state’s transit stations, and it is time to provide the infrastructure necessary to keep them safe and enable more local trips to be done in ways that don’t contribute to traffic and congestion.
Congestion pricing is already encouraging people to think differently about transportation. More and more people are realizing the harsh reality of a transportation system built solely for cars: if everyone drives, nobody moves. Public officials must commit to improving mass transit and expanding alternative transportation options if we want to have safe, healthy communities instead of endless traffic, congestion, and pollution.
Sadly, some of our representatives are choosing to be fear-mongers instead of leading. They would rather promote a handful of sensational crime incidents around transit, hoping the public ignores the traffic violence that has not only become routine on our streets but has gotten worse, with 691 traffic fatalities in New Jersey last year alone.
New Jersey’s mass transit system is something few other states have, and people should feel empowered and motivated to utilize this amenity that connects us to the wider region. Furthermore, people should demand that service be valued, improved, and expanded by our elected leaders to meet the state’s transportation needs.
From Bergen County and beyond, the benefits of congestion pricing are clear. We should be celebrating it as the step forward it is and not allowing lawmakers to distract us with an obvious smear campaign against the program for political gain. Congestion pricing is a regional fix for a regional problem — improving connectivity for commuters and reducing traffic and gridlock throughout the area. It’s time for Gov. Murphy and other New Jersey representatives to address our transportation challenges directly by making our own transit investments instead of trying to tear down others.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma House has officially sent 438 bills to the Senate. 
The bills that advanced make up just over 20% of the roughly 1,960 House measures filed at the start of session. And while a supermajority of those were authored by Republicans, a record number of Democrat bills advanced, the House minority leader said. 
Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, attributed the chamber’s success to a two-tiered committee system with new oversight committees that he implemented this session. 
“We went into the evenings a few nights, but you never saw any super late nights,” he said Thursday during a media availability. “I think this might be the first session I’ve experienced, at least that I can remember, where we weren’t in here past 10 p.m. hearing legislation. And I think that’s kudos to our new two tier committee system, where bills, when they made it to the floor, they were ready for primetime because members put in work on their bills on the front end.”
Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said 29 Democratic bills were sent over to the Senate this year. 
“I think that’s a record for us. In the last several years we’ve been working well with the Republican caucus to get our bills done,” she said Thursday. “But you know, our members have worked really hard on our priorities and working across the aisle and looking for things that solve problems for Oklahomans.”
Of the hundreds of bills that passed through the House, some have garnered more attention. House lawmakers advanced:

House Bill 1003 that seeks to raise the age sexual of consent in Oklahoma from 16 to 18 years old; 
a bill creating the first residential setbacks for wind turbines, requiring they be half a nautical mile from dwellings and 1.5 times the turbine’s height from neighboring property lines. A similar measure passed the Senate, but with smaller setback requirements; 
legislation creating a new felony for being in the U.S. illegally that would repeal a controversial law that was signed last year; 
a ban on cellphone use in schools. The House sent legislation requiring a bell-to-bell ban to the Senate; 
two bills that would legalize sports betting in Oklahoma, with exclusivity granted to tribes despite the threat of veto from Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt; 
a bill allowing health care providers to refuse to offer specific procedures or care based on moral, religious or conscientious beliefs is on its way to the Senate. It advanced despite earlier opposition from Oklahoma physicians;
a handful of bills from Rep. Suzanne Schrieber, D-Tulsa, addressing child care issues in the state. These measures include granting a tax credit to employers that provides childcare subsidies to employees and exempting the income of child care providers when applying for the Child Care Subsidy Program;  
a bill, which increases the amount a person who is wrongfully convicted can claim, advanced. It would allow wrongfully incarcerated inmates to claim $50,000 per year of incarceration. State law caps the compensation amount at $175,000; 
a bill increasing payments to foster care families intended to help families cover the cost of caring for a foster child by $5 per day; 
a bill requiring school districts to show a video on human growth and development while in the womb to high school students passed through the House; 
an effort to give the Oklahoma Attorney General the ability to investigate and enforce reported violations of the Open Records Act by public bodies; and 
a bill creating a license for “professional storm chasers” that allows them to subvert road closures, run red lights, add flashing lights and act as “emergency vehicles.”

Two bills seeking to alter Oklahoma’s cockfighting statutes did not advance and did not receive a hearing in a committee. 
A bill to bar undocumented immigrants in Oklahoma from driving vehicles using licenses issued in other states also did not get heard on the floor. 
The bills that advanced are eligible to be heard in Senate committees over the coming weeks. The Senate sent 321 bills to the House for consideration.

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.As Wisconsin school districts seek permission this week from voters to spend more than $1.6 billion for operational and building costs, state lawmakers are looking for ways to address the issue of schools’ growing reliance on referendum requests.
Voters across the state are deciding this spring on a total of 94 referendum requests including some in February and many in the upcoming April 1 elections. According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, it’s the most ever between January and April in a non-presidential or midterm election year and it’s the continuation of an ongoing trend.
Republicans have introduced three proposals for new limitations on the referendum process in reaction to Milwaukee Public Schools’ successful request last year, with lawmakers saying the proposals would increase fairness and transparency for voters and taxpayers. However, one Democratic lawmaker and other stakeholders said the proposals would limit local control and don’t address the structural financial issues that drive school districts to go to referendum.
Eliminating ‘recurring’ referendum requests
A bill coauthored by Rep. Cindi Duchow (R-Town of Delafield) and Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield)  would eliminate referendum questions that allow permanent operational funding increases and would limit other referendum requests to cover no more than a four-year period.
Duchow said in an interview with the Wisconsin Examiner that she doesn’t think there is a problem with school districts going to referendum and called them the “perfect tool” to allow local residents to make funding decisions. But she doesn’t think funding increases sought through a referendum should be permanent — or, in legislative terminology, “recurring” year after year. 
The referendum option was created for schools in 1993 as a part of legislation that put limits on schools’ ability to raise revenue by increasing property taxes. 
Anne Chapman, research director for the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials Association (WASBO), said in an interview that the idea behind the legislation was that property taxpayers would be protected and the state would take care of school districts financially in return. From 1993 to 2010, revenue caps — the limit on how much districts could raise without voters’ permission — were tied to inflation. The inflationary increases were eliminated in 2009 and state funding has not filled the gap to give schools an inflationary increase. 
According to WASBO, general school district revenues have lagged the rate of inflation for a decade and a half. If funding had kept up with inflation, districts would be getting $3,380 more per pupil in 2025.
Wisconsin schools also only receive funding for about a third of their special education costs and many are drawing from their general funds to keep up with providing expensive federally and state mandated services to students with disabilities. Districts are also dealing with declining enrollment, which results in lower funding for a district as there are fewer students even if fixed costs such as maintaining facilities may not fall.
School officials and advocates have pointed out that many districts are relying heavily on referendum requests to meet costs (even to keep schools open), saying the trend is untenable. Mauston School District is one example as school leaders were considering dissolving the district after two failed referendum requests until voters finally approved a request in February.
Chapman noted that when a referendum fails it can result in a school deferring maintenance, increasing class sizes and cutting staff, AP programs, language, support staff for special education, nurses, librarians, athletics and “all the things that kids need to kind of stay engaged in school.” 
Dale Knapp, director of Wisconsin-based research organization Forward Analytics, said in 2023 that he didn’t “think the lawmakers who created this law envisioned referenda being relied on this much.”
“Maybe the answer after 30 years of the limits is an in-depth review of the law to see how it can be improved to continue protecting taxpayers and ensure adequate funding of our schools,” Knapp said.
Duchow, however, said that the state is providing “plenty of money” to schools.
“If they want a new gym, that’s on them. I’m not here to build you a new gym. The people who live in that community should make that decision,” Duchow said. She also said there are some schools that probably need to consolidate and others that need to close.
While school districts do go to voters to fund building costs, many are also going to referendum for “operational” (and often recurring) costs and as a way to keep up with staff pay, afford educational offerings and pay utility bills.
Duchow said recurring referendum questions are unfair. She said lawmakers in the caucus have been discussing changing the policy for a while. A similar proposal was introduced in 2017.
“We are looking at declining enrollment around this state, and how do we know what we really need 10 years from now?” Duchow said. “The Milwaukee referendum never goes away, so 10 years from now, we have less students in Milwaukee and we need the same amount of money?  We have more technology coming in, which means we probably need less teachers.” 
Duchow said Milwaukee’s $252 million operating referendum, which was the second largest school operating request in state history, was the “catalyst” for her bill.
Republican lawmakers and other state leaders have been highly critical of the request, which the district said was needed to fund staff pay and educational programming and voters narrowly approved. The criticism grew louder after the district’s financial crisis that resulted in the resignation of the superintendent and audits launched by Gov. Tony Evers.
“Enough is enough. MPS is a disaster. We have the worst reading scores in the nation, and all they do is scream they need more money,” Duchow said. “Money is obviously not the answer.”
Even with declining enrollment, the Milwaukee Public School District is the largest district in the state with 65,000 students enrolled, according to the 2024-25 enrollment data from DPI. This is over 2.5 times as many students as the next largest district in Wisconsin, Madison Metropolitan School District.
MPS students are also more likely to face significant challenges. More than 20% of students in the district have a disability, more than 80% are economically disadvantaged and 17.5% are English language learners. Statewide about 40% of students are economically disadvantaged, 15.7% are students with disabilities and 6.92% are English language learners.
Chapman said students with higher needs often incur higher costs for districts. 
Duchow said that putting a four-year limit on referendum requests for recurring funds gives communities the ability to react to changing circumstances and that school districts should justify to voters why they need the funds. She said she would be open to discussing a different limit when it comes to nonrecurring referendum requests.
“It’s also not fair that everybody could vote for that referendum and then decide, hey, this is really too expensive. I can’t afford these property taxes and then they move out, and I’m still there paying the referendum,” Duchow said. 
Duchow said she hadn’t yet spoken with any school district leaders when she was interviewed by the Examiner in early March, but planned to reach out before a public hearing on the bill.
“I’m sure I can already tell you how the schools are going to feel. The schools are going to feel they want their recurring referendum, just like we want your boss to give you a 20% raise every year without you justifying why you should get it,” Duchow said. “That’s what the schools want, too. I don’t blame them. I would, too, but we can’t do that to our taxpayers.”
According to the Wisconsin Eye on Lobbying website, the Wisconsin Education Association Council has registered against the bill, while the Wisconsin REALTORS Association has registered in favor.
Lawmakers have added new restrictions to school referendum requests before. The 2017-19 state budget limited scheduling of a referendum requests to only two per year and only allowed them to be held on regularly scheduled election days.
“It used to be that referendums could be called by a school district at any time, but the Legislature said… we don’t want you to have the option to run so many referendums,” Chapman said. 
Chapman noted in an interview that recurring referendum requests pass at lower rates than other types because it is harder to convince taxpayers. She said voters “know how to handle this” and lawmakers shouldn’t further reach in to restrict district’s options.
“Some districts and some communities want a recurring referendum,” Chapman said. “School districts have the option of asking for recurring and sometimes they do and voters sometimes approve them because they’re asking to fill structural budget holes that are never going to go away. They’re asking for basic operating dollars that they’re going to need in four years.” 
A recent Marquette Law School poll found that Wisconsinites are becoming increasingly concerned with holding down property taxes since 2018 and less favorably inclined toward increasing funding for K-12 public schools. 
Chapman noted that districts also often make nonrecurring referendum requests for recurring costs because they are an easier ask, though this places districts in another difficult position.
“As soon as you go to nonrecurring referendum in this environment with grossly inadequate state funding and state policies to support schools financially, you are now going to be in your own personal fiscal cliff,” Chapman said. “You’re going to have to go again, and probably for more, because your costs have gone up and funding does not keep up with inflation.” 
Bills meant to provide ‘fairness,’ ‘transparency’
Lawmakers, concerned about the MPS referendum, requested a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo last year that found some school districts in Wisconsin could see a decrease in state aid after the MPS referendum due to the way that equalization aid is calculated.
Equalization aid acts as a form of property tax relief, according to the Wisconsin School Business Officials Association. The amount of aid a district receives from the finite pot of money distributed by the state is determined by a formula that depends on a district’s property wealth, spending and enrollment.
Spending triggered by referendum requests is one factor in determining districts’ equalization aid, and Milwaukee — like other districts with low property wealth per pupil compared to the rest of the state — will receive more state aid per pupil than other districts with higher property wealth per pupil as a result of its increased spending from the referendum.
Chapman noted, however, that all 148 referendum requests for operating expenses in 2024 affect the share of equalization aid districts receive. She also emphasized that it’s not the only factor affecting the amount of aid districts get.
“Some districts have increasing enrollment, which means they’re going to pull more money away from Milwaukee.” Chapman said. “There’s all of these factors that affect every single district, and they intertwine with each other.”
Republicans viewed Milwaukee’s referendum as taking too much from other districts. 
“Is it fair to the students, parents and taxpayers in Waukesha, Madison, Wautoma and others suffer without having the right to cast a vote?” the bill authors Rep. Scott Allen (R-Waukesha) and Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) asked in a memo. “Local school referendums should not have a significant negative impact on other districts. Simple fairness demands this type of thinking.”
The lawmakers’ bill would exclude any district referendum request worth more than $50 million from being considered when determining equalization aid. The effect of the bill would be that districts that pass a large referendum would have their aid eligibility reduced, leaving local taxpayers to pay more of the cost. The bill would only apply to districts below a certain property wealth value.
Chapman said the bill would penalize districts for being larger and having lower property wealth and is an example of lawmakers trying to micromanage local entities.
A final bill introduced by Allen and Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) would require that tax impact information be added to ballots. Currently, referendum ballot questions are required to include the dollar amount of the increase in the levy limit.
Under the bill, referendum questions would also need to include the estimated interest rate and amount of the interest accruing on the bonds, any fees that will be incurred if the bonds are defeased and a “good faith estimate of the dollar amount difference in property taxes on a median-valued, single-family residence located in the local governmental unit that would result from passage of the referendum.” 
Proposal criticisms
Freshman Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said he wasn’t inclined to support a ban on recurring referendum requests given the inconsistency in state funding. 
“We go through this sort of toxic [state] budget cycle every two years and districts have to levy, and they don’t even know what to plan for, so recurring referendums are obviously a response to that,” Phelps said.
Phelps said the question of fairness is relevant when talking about the referendum process, but the framing of the Republican proposals is misguided, given the state’s over $4 billion budget surplus.
“It is not fair to taxpayers that, depending on what school district you live in, you might have an astronomical property tax bill just to keep that district running. That’s not fair,” Phelps said. He said the state of Wisconsin is “underfunding public schools and not using the taxes people already paid.”
Derek Gottleib, an assistant professor at the University of Northern Colorado and senior research director for School Perceptions, an education research firm, said Republicans appear to be “operating on behalf of the taxpayers across the state who have voted no on school referendums and yet lost and so had their taxes raised anyway.”
“Suddenly, because so many [referendum requests] are passing, homeowners, taxpayers who don’t want to have their taxes raised are saying that this is unfair or we shouldn’t have to have our taxes raised just because everybody in our community wants to raise our taxes and Republicans are coming to the defense of those folks,” Gottleib said. 
According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, while the number of requests continues to rise, approval rates have started to decline with the 66.2% approval rate in 2024 being the lowest in a midterm or presidential election year since 2012.
Gottleib said some of the concerns raised by lawmakers are valid. For example, he said the current terms used to describe referendum questions are “obscure” and unclear.
“Why not just say a permanent referendum and a temporary referendum?” he asked. “You could do a lot to increase the transparency of what people are voting on if you made that little language change.” 
Gottleib also said that he does have “sympathy” for those who don’t think there should be permanent funding requests, but acknowledged that this would have consequences for districts because it removes predictability in planning.
However, he said he doesn’t agree that the potential for people to move out of a community or into a community in the future should be the deciding factor in funding decisions. 
“That’s a basic feature of any community anywhere,” he said. 
The argument that “it is not a legitimate exercise of public governmental power to make a decision for a community, given the fact that the community will change in the future…is ridiculous,” Gottleib said. “If that were the case, it would make all public decisions fundamentally illegitimate.”
The increasing number of referendum requests, Gottleib said, is a sign that revenue limits are set too low, at an amount that is unacceptable to community members. He noted that when operational referendum requests fail, the schools typically cut theater arts, advanced placement coursework, second language instruction, foreign language instruction and other programs that aren’t required by the state.
Chapman called the proposals a “BandAid” on the issues districts are facing that “isn’t even really fixing the problem.” 
“[If] legislators really wanted to protect taxpayers and make sure schools have what they need, they would do something like keep revenue limits inflationary [and] significantly improve the funding for special education, which would help every single kid,” Chapman said.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Watercraft inspection stations managed by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture are open for the 2025 season. 
This means all boat owners — regardless of their watercraft size, propulsion, motorized or non-motorized — must stop for mandatory inspection when traveling past an inspection station during operating hours. 
Inspection stations are essential to prevent invasive species, such as quagga mussels, from entering Idaho’s waterways. Quagga mussels were first discovered in the Snake River near Twin Falls in 2023, and have since cost the state millions to suppress as they have the potential to outcompete other aquatic species and clog agricultural and energy infrastructure.
Quagga mussel elimination efforts have also killed thousands of native fish in the Snake River, including at least 48 white sturgeon, some of which were up to 35 years old and eight feet long, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
‘We take this seriously’: ISDA director on out-of-state boat traffic, Idaho quagga mussels

“Stopping at watercraft inspection stations and following the simple steps of cleaning, draining, and drying your watercraft are essential to ensuring Idaho’s waters thrive for generations to come,” department director Chanel Tewalt said in a press release. “It is up to all of us — boaters, anglers, and outdoor enthusiasts — to take responsibility in safeguarding our waters from invasive species.” 
 How to prevent the spread of invasive species in Idaho waterways

Idaho law requires all out-of-state watercraft to be inspected and decontaminated at a watercraft inspection station prior to launch.
When entering Idaho, boat owners should look for road signage and electronic message boards directing them to inspection stations. Before launching a watercraft in Idaho, nonresident owners must also purchase an invasive species sticker. 
Before transporting any watercraft, Idaho law requires operators to remove the drain plug and drain all water, including from internal compartments such as ballasts, bilges, live wells, and motors. All bilge and ballast plugs and other barriers that prevent water drainage must be removed and remain open while a watercraft is transported by land within the state.
To prevent the spread of invasive species, watercraft owners can follow these steps: 

Clean all equipment before leaving any waterbody, removing visible plants and animals.
Drain water from all compartments, including motors, live wells and boats. Pull the boat’s bilge plug and allow water to drain. 
Dry all equipment thoroughly before using the watercraft in a different waterbody.

In 2024, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture’s Invasive Species Program performed nearly 157,000 watercraft inspections — a 44% increase from 2023. Throughout the history of the program, Idaho stations have performed over one million inspections.

(Getty Images)Health insurance companies are under increasing scrutiny for allegedly using artificial intelligence bots and algorithms to swiftly deny patients routine or lifesaving care — without a human actually reviewing their claims.
The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
The federal role
Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
Senators move prior authorization, PBM regulations

But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
What states are doing
Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.
In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.










There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.


– North Carolina Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder


“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Cave City was quiet last week.
The day after a high-end EF-3 tornado ripped through the small Sharp County town with 165-mile-per-hour winds on March 14, the main stretch had been abuzz with volunteers, heavy machinery and people sifting through what remained of their homes, businesses and storage units.
Fifteen tornadoes touched down in Arkansas during the March 14-15 severe weather event, according to the National Weather Service. Three people were killed in neighboring Independence County by the same tornado that devastated Cave City. That tornado was also the longest-tracked tornado in Arkansas since 2008, according to the weather service, remaining on the ground for over 80 miles — something the service noted as being “exceptionally rare” for a tornado in Arkansas.
Fast forward a week and a half, and the atmosphere in town has changed. Power lines no longer litter the sidewalk on one side of Main Street. People weren’t slowing in their cars, gawking and taking videos on their phones as they drove past the destruction. Cell service had been restored, even if it was somewhat spotty.
The cleanup had made remarkable progress, even after a week that began with a tornado and continued with whipping winds and fires that burned homes in an already-devastated area. 
The remains of the town’s pharmacy — totalled by the tornado — are gone. Only a concrete pad and a small pile of rubble remain. The church and the grocery store are surrounded by fences, their roofs covered with tarps and sheet metal to keep out future rain. An excavator began tearing into a brick house next door to the grocery store, pulling down what remained of its roof.
Other than people operating heavy machinery — clearing debris and trees — not many people were walking around.
Irma Carrigan, who runs the Crystal River Cave Tours and Motel, said the day after the storm that she wasn’t convinced the hordes of volunteers and support that arrived in town after the storm would last. But on Wednesday, a week and a half after the tornado that totaled her car and pulled down a massive tree in her yard, crushing one of the many small buildings on her property, Carrigan said she’d been pleasantly surprised by just how much people wanted to help, noting that she hadn’t heard one complaint from those who had arrived to offer assistance.
“It has all been very positive, very caring people,” Carrington said. “They set up food centers for different places. We didn’t have to cook during all of that.”
“The volunteerism is just phenomenal,” Carrington said. Still, sometimes it could be overwhelming, she noted, being asked by volunteers how to help when those impacted themselves still weren’t sure.
“You just look ignorant to them because you’re just saying, ‘I don’t know,’” Carrington said.
The waves of volunteers ebbed about five days after the storm, Carrigan reported, but she was grateful for the help she got. A nonprofit brought in a crane, cut up the huge tree into chunks, and helped haul it onto a family friend’s truck. Some roofers reattached a part from her roof that had blown off in the storm.
Still, other things have been slow coming. Carrigan said that as of Wednesday, they were still being told they had to boil their water. Their internet only returned two days prior, and cell service wasn’t always reliable.
In the aftermath of the storm, sleep was sometimes hard to come by.
“Your brain won’t turn off,” Carrigan said. “I think mentally, you can’t shut it off. You’re still thinking, ‘What am I going to be doing tomorrow? What can I do?’ You just continue to pray that you’ll get guidance and where you need to go next.”
Walking down one of the roads that branched off from Main Street, Carrigan pointed to her neighbors’ houses. The white, two-story, former boarding house next to hers was the oldest in town, she said, and one of its occupants was on hospice. It was badly damaged.
Next door to it was a smaller house, the back of it torn open. Those neighbors, Carrigan said, were trapped under the rubble of their home for hours after the tornado hit. One of them was over 90 years old. She said she’d heard that the property had already been sold to someone else.
The yellow house even farther down was occupied by another elderly neighbor in their 90s, Carrigan reported. They planned to repair the damage, she’d heard.
Another neighbor will tear down and put in a mobile home, Carrigan said. Yet another told Carrigan they were considering a modular home.
“He said, ‘I’m too old to build. I’m too old to rebuild,’” Carrigan said of the neighbor who was considering a mobile home. “And he said, ‘I want something; I don’t want to wait two or three years to get it.’”
Some people were scared to even clean their windows until their insurance appraisers showed up, Carrigan said, leaving some in a state of limbo.
Carrigan expressed support for a federal disaster declaration, which Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders requested last week. Sander asked for additional federal help over the weekend.
“I would think they would,” Carrigan said of the federal government helping with disaster recovery. “I mean, I can’t imagine a disaster any worse.”
However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which normally manages federal disaster responses, is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration as one of its targets to be shut down, with the Washington Post reporting that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressed support for removing FEMA’s role in recovering from disasters by October. 
It’s unclear how such an action would impact a federal disaster response in Arkansas if the declaration is approved. Stateline reported last month that disaster experts and states have said that they aren’t able to take on the role FEMA currently fills.
Carrigan wasn’t the only one who would like to see the disaster declaration approved. Brandi Schulz, the executive director of the Cave City Area Chamber of Commerce, said the money that would be available to both businesses and residents would help with the recovery.
“From a chamber director perspective, I know that (a federal disaster declaration) would open up some options for our businesses that were impacted,” Schulz said. “I know that there were going to be more options, supplemental options, outside of insurance if that does go through, so in that regard, I am hoping that we can get more assistance to our businesses and also to our residents.”
Schulz described Cave City as a “very DIY community,” and said that it, combined with the support of volunteers and donors, meant that the city would likely be in “a very good place” on debris removal within the next week. Roughly 59 people have been displaced by the tornado in the area, Schulz estimated.
Taking care of the physical needs of those who were affected doesn’t just mean helping clear debris, however. Schulz said the wife of the town’s fire chief, whom the chamber director said “specializes in trauma debriefing,” has been offering resources for the community.
“I think the biggest thing is people knowing that they’re not alone, that we’re here for them,” Schulz said. “And I think we’ve shown that in the last week or so.”
Carrigan expressed some frustration with communication from state and local authorities, even as she said she appreciated what they were doing and was satisfied with the rate at which cleanup and recovery had been happening. She heard that state money was available to those impacted to help with storm recovery, but wasn’t able to figure out how to apply. She said the Red Cross opened a shelter, only to close it 48 hours later.
“I went up to the Assembly of God to check out, try to find this Red Cross and they said, ‘Well, they were here, but nobody came up here to use their services,’” Carrigan said. “And I said, ‘Well, honey, nobody knew that they were here.’”
Schulz said local officials made efforts to reach people who weren’t able to get online information, at one point distributing fliers, she said. 
The Red Cross confirmed it closed the shelter due to lack of use.
“We had some families that expressed interest, and then had found other places to say,” Red Cross regional spokesperson Sharon Watson said, adding that they had been coordinating with local faith leaders and town officials to get the word out. “Some had requested hotels, and we didn’t have hotel vouchers to offer because we had a shelter set up, and our shelter was available so therefore they opted to find other places to stay, which we completely understand.”
Watson noted that the shelter wasn’t the only way it was helping the community. On Thursday, the Red Cross opened several “Multi-Agency Resource Centers” in conjunction with the Arkansas Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster for those affected by the tornado outbreak, designed to serve as a “one-stop shop” for residents to get answers from state and local authorities about disaster assistance. 
The MARCs were open from Thursday to Sunday in different cities — Diaz on Thursday, Cave City on Friday, Melbourne on Saturday, and Pocahontas on Sunday. 
Meanwhile, management of volunteers and donations was handed over to Eight Days of Hope, a Christian nonprofit, after being managed by local officials such as Schulz. 
Gale Manning, the rapid response manager for the Cave City relief efforts, said the organization will be on the ground until April 5. Volunteers have been helping cut up and haul off trees, he said, to help make the area safer. He said roughly 70 to 80 people had been volunteering on the weekdays, with volunteers coming from as far away as Alaska.
“They’re devastated,” Manning said of the people who had been impacted by the storm. “They’ve lost their life savings, belongings. But, you know, as the days go on, they feel a bit better. Again, we share the gospel and we let them know that God’s in control and that he knows what’s going on, and he promised us all a better day.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5054-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 07:00:24.114912

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)It feels like Oklahoma officials have lost touch with reality and think President Donald Trump must be the biggest idiot on the planet.
Because why else would they be first in line in trying to snooker the Trump administration into giving a state that has some of the worst education outcomes in the entire country essentially carte blanche power to decide how hundreds of millions of federal dollars should be spent in our schools?
Last week, our state superintendent and some Republican legislative leaders urged Trump’s administration to bypass the U.S. Department of Education’s traditional funding pathways and give federal dollars directly to the state so that Oklahoma’s Education Department can categorize schools “into types based on need” and offer a “diverse marketplace of solutions.”
Our leaders stupidly argue that federal officials tie too many administrative and bureaucratic strings to that funding. Those “strings” are used to ensure compliance with pesky things like our children’s civil rights.
In a video posted to X, Superintendent Ryan Walters said that having direct access to the funding will ensure more money gets into the classroom and to teachers and improve academic outcomes and results, instead of being tied up in administrative costs.
“This will forever change education. It will forever empower states and give states the ability to truly empower parents,” Walters said.
If this happens, it will forever change Oklahoma education, but I suspect it won’t be for the better.
Our lawmakers and Walters haven’t proven yet that they deserve this enormous amount of trust. It seems like a terrible idea to give them unchecked powers to determine winners and losers in our already struggling school system. Why on earth would we want to enable them to underfund certain rural and urban schools, increase funding to private schools, undercut services offered to impoverished or tribal students, or demolish programs that serve special education or English learners?
Walters pledged that he’d continue supporting disabled students, but made no guarantees about protecting anyone else. We don’t know how our leaders would spend the money differently in a way that bolsters math and reading literacy rates.
Recent nationwide tests showed that only 23% of fourth graders and 20% of eighth graders were proficient in reading. Only 31% of fourth graders and 17% of eighth graders were proficient in math.
Without cheating, that needle stubbornly refuses to move under our Legislature, which has wisely zeroed in on improving academic outcomes while somehow simultaneously managing to demonstrate their overall lack of understanding of how learning happens.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said in a statement that “Oklahomans are best-equipped to determine what education should look like for our students.”
I’d like to know why he believes we’re suddenly best equipped to oversee hundreds of millions in additional dollars.
Perhaps it is because we’re bottom 10 in reading and math proficiency. Or is it because the private school tax credit program lawmakers are wasting our money on is serving an outsized number of rich families? Is it because Republicans are unveiling increasingly bizarre schemes amid growing public pressure to improve academic performance? Or maybe it is because GOP lawmakers are apparently so bad at state budgeting that they’ve padded the existing state Department of Education budget so much that Walters was emboldened to buy Bibles and give his employees $600,000 in raises, including a $45,000 payout to the agency’s chief adviser.
Meanwhile, because we can’t get enough qualified educators in our classrooms, lawmakers are looking to remove a requirement that our early childhood educators have a college degree. Even though that strategy has not measurably improved performance in the upper grades, they want to allow those without a formal education to teach our youngest students the building blocks of reading and math. Yikes. Maybe instead of lowering the standards of who we allow in our classrooms, we should just acknowledge teaching is hard and make sure we’re paying a wage that makes qualified people want to teach.
State leaders are still pointing the finger at each other for last year’s insane effort to bamboozle Oklahomans into thinking our children’s academic prowess had dramatically increased under Walters’ tutelage. In reality, our leaders secretly lowered the bar students must meet to be proficient and didn’t tell anyone — until Oklahoma Voice uncovered it. Even then Walters ignored the fiasco for months.
And for a state that likes to lament overtesting, our legislators sure are proud of mandating an unnecessary exit exam. Starting this year, Oklahoma students must complete the U.S. Naturalization Test in order to graduate. It’s just one more unnecessary hurdle that could prevent someone from graduating and distracts from our real struggles.
Frankly, none of that gives me a lot of confidence that Oklahoma’s government would know how to spend federal dollars for policies and initiatives that would ensure that our schools and students are achieving their maximum potential.
If anything, our leaders should be begging Trump’s federal government to increase its scrutiny of our school system or perhaps fund increased teacher and school support staff wages.
Because only states that meet the highest academic outcomes should be given the flexibility to control their own fate.

New Jersey is among the states considering bills that would force fossil fuel companies to pay recovery costs for climate disasters. (Photo by Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Courtesy of Barbara Perez)OMAHA — Mele Mason recalls the days when the newsroom at Omaha TV station KMTV had journalists covering city hall, the county courthouse, the statehouse and the “cop shop.”
Reporters attended multiple other governmental meetings and community gatherings, said Mason, who worked as a news videographer at the station in the 1980s.
But those days are gone, she said, with her old newsroom now about one-third the size.
So when Mason saw that an effort was underway to address shrinking newsrooms by enlisting local residents to document actions taken at government meetings, she signed up.
“It just has been frustrating to see the lack of information that’s coming out. Coverage has gone way down. They don’t have the usual beat reporters,” Mason said.
Today, she is among about 60 people in the Omaha area who have undergone training to become “Documenters” at local government meetings, by taking notes and passing them onto editors for publication.
“I wanted to do something for the community,” Mason said. “I think it’s important that people have access to what happens at public meetings.”
Finding reporters in new places

That is one of the example of how news outlets increasingly look to ordinary folks to help them cover news events. This comes as there are fewer reporters and fewer applicants for reporting jobs, particularly in rural areas.
At Nebraska’s community newspapers, would-be citizen reporters are taking an online training course called “Earn Your Press Pass” to learn how to cover meetings. Other papers rely more on retirees, freelancers and “sports moms” to help.
At the Sidney Sun-Telegraph, Barbara Perez took the Press Pass course after being promoted from advertising manager to editor-publisher. She didn’t have any formal training as a reporter, so the Press Pass program — which she now requires of every new hire on staff — got her up to speed on issues like open meetings laws, public records and newspaper style.
“It’s especially helpful when you’re not hiring classically trained journalists,” said Perez from her office in western Nebraska. “We can’t just print anything, like the hearsay you see on social media.”
Getting creative
At the West Point News, editor Mike O’Brien lured a former news editor, Willis Mahannah, out of retirement to cover city council and county board meetings after losing a news reporter and being unable to fill the vacancy. To help cover the communities of Beemer and Bancroft, O’Brien relies on “contacts” in those towns to provide tips and stories.

“We had three full-time reporters, but now we’re down to me as the lone reporter,” O’Brien said. “Papers are finding it harder and harder to have a full staff, so definitely we’re relying more on contributions to the community.”
A recent study by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found that there were 565 full-time reporters at print and broadcast outlets in the state.
While there was no past data to compare with the number of journalists now, Jessica Walsh, an assistant UNL professor of journalism, said there’s no doubt the number has declined.
Her effort to map and track local reporting in Nebraska found at least nine counties with no local reporting outlet and 16 county seats that had no local news organization.
Walsh said that when she talked to local editors and station managers, she was struck by the strong sense of dedication to providing local news.
But they also told her how hard it has become to hire trained journalists, particularly in rural areas.
Different era


Mapping Nebraska journalism
Part of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln report on journalists in the state included developing an interactive “map” of where reporters are located.
Jessica Walsh, the UNL professor who headed up the study, said it provides an instant look at where “news deserts” are located in the state, and where they aren’t.
Fifty-five of the state’s 93 counties in the state, the study found, have two or fewer full-time local journalists.
Walsh said the map shows the “areas of concern” for news coverage, since studies have show that civic engagement declines in areas with no coverage.
She said she hopes her work makes Nebraskans “more appreciative of their local journalist(s)” and inspires those who don’t subscribe to the local newspaper, to do so.


The result is that the remaining journalists often cover multiple towns or beats. One recent ad for an editor/reporter in central Nebraska sought someone to cover eight communities.
“When I look at this report, I don’t see that everything is horrible and there’s no hope,” Walsh said. “On the people level, there’s a lot of dedicated local journalists, covering meetings and sports at night. They’re really part of the community.”
She said she “was encouraged by all the people still working in local journalism despite the challenges.”
“They’re just really spread thin,” Walsh said.
One way local newspapers are addressing the shortage of reporters is by enlisting non-journalists to help out, said Dennis Derossett, the executive director of the Nebraska Press Association.
While many small-town papers traditionally had their “chicken dinner” correspondents, DeRossett said that the goal of the Press Pass program is to train someone to cover “true news events” and happenings in a community.
New training
The Press Pass program was created by Joey and Lindsey Young, who saw how difficult it was for western Kansas newspapers – including the three they own – to recruit college journalism grads to rural areas.
Joey Young, who served as president of the Kansas Press Association, said his wife used her background as a teacher to develop the online program. It covers topics like interviewing skills, covering meetings, writing in newspaper style and journalism ethics.
Hundreds of prospective journalists across the country have taken the course, Young said, with several advancing from correspondents or part-time reporters to full-time jobs.
“Community newspapers have to adapt. The traditional pipeline of journalists fresh out of college working in rural community newsrooms isn’t there anymore,” he said. “I think newspapers have an opportunity to pivot to this model in training interested community members into becoming good reporters.”
Documenters is a national program now active in 27 U.S. cities that seeks to train people to attend under-reported meetings and take notes – notes that can later be turned into reports on what happened.
The Nebraska program, based in Omaha, is run through the Nebraska Journalism Trust, which also operates the online news outlet, the Flatwater Free Press.
Documenting meetings
About 60 Documenters have taken the training since the Nebraska program was revived last summer, said Leah Keinama, director of civic journalism for the Trust.


Nebraska Documenters

Earn Your Press Pass information can be obtained on the website, www.earnyourpresspass.com


About 10 of those graduates consistently cover meetings in the Omaha area, from the Omaha School Board and Omaha City Council, to the Douglas County Board and Westside School Board.
The program is seeking to expand into Nebraska’s Panhandle, to document meetings in a rural area over the next couple of months, Keinama said.
Documenters are paid $16 an hour, with a minimum of three hours paid to attend a meeting, take notes and turn them over to Keinama, who edits the notes into reports posted on the Flatwater website.
“What we want them to do is produce very objective notes of what happened,” she said. “So that if someone wasn’t at this meeting, they would understand what happened.”
Keinama said she feels that the Documenters notes offer more detail and are often more objective than the official meeting minutes generated and posted by a clerk of a government board.
The reports generated by the Documenters, besides providing accountability, can be used by full-time journalists to generate more detailed stories, she said.
The work also serves to give people a taste of what it’s like to be a reporter, Keinama, perhaps leading someone to pursue a job as a journalist.
“It’s really important for people to know that they have a place in citizen journalism and the civic process and that you don’t need special credentials or special exposure,” she said.
Leaning on viewers
Nebraska TV and radio stations have nothing akin to Documenters or Earn Your Press Pass to train regular citizens to become reporters, but they are relying more and more on video and photographs submitted by citizens, according to Jim Timm, president and executive director of the Nebraska Broadcasters Association.
The recent blizzard, Timm said, was a good example, with people sending in images of damage. Accidents and fires are other examples, he said.
Mason is well acquainted with the news landscape. Besides being a former video journalist at TV stations in Omaha and Seattle, she has her own freelance video outlet, Mason Video in Omaha.
Her firm is regularly hired by NBC, CNN, Fox and ESPN to provide video of Omaha — and Nebraska-area events. Recent live feeds included an interview with former astronaut Clayton Anderson and video from the tumultuous town hall held by U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb.
She said she was impressed by the quality of the Documenters training. Mason said she realizes that traditional news outlets don’t have the staff anymore to cover all the government meetings, but the work is important.
“It’s kind of scary that all these things could go on without anyone knowing what is going on in their government and their city,” she said.

Hundreds gathered on the lawn of the Capitol for around two hours Sunday for a rally featuring speakers, dance breaks and performances by local drag queens.
Transgender Day of Visibility is celebrated internationally every year on March 31 after Michigan resident Rachel Crandall-Crocker founded the holiday in 2009 to create a day focused on the happiness of the transgender and nonbinary communities.
Emme Zanotti, senior director of movement building and political affairs for Equality Michigan, said during the rally that “Trans Day of Visibility certifies that we are here and solidifies that we are to be seen as living, breathing human beings” rather than “just accepting that who we are as human beings is to be hidden, cast aside or kept a deep, dark secret.”

While Trans Unity Coalition founder Bree Taylor said the current political climate is challenging, and transgender people have a right to feel hurt, she said it is important to “find moments of celebration in the midst of adversity and to keep showing up with that joy.”
“When we decide to exist proudly in the public eye, we disrupt every storyline that says we can only be ashamed of ourselves or invisible,” Taylor said.
Audra Wilson, who represents the transgender community on Michigan’s LGBTQ+ Commission, said events like the rally provide a safe space for people to find a sense of belonging with other members of the community and allies.
“This is somewhere where, even though we’re out in public, people get to be themselves. People get to feel safe. People get to be seen and be visible,” Wilson said.

But creating a sense of community is just as important for people who may not be as comfortable sharing their identity publicly, Crossroads founder Grace Bacon said, encouraging the crowd to host small gatherings and be intentional about forming friendships.
“We have to ferret out the people who are scared to come out, give them a place to be, a time to be, so that they can be themselves for a little while,” Bacon said.
Roz Keith, the founder of Stand with Trans, said that her goal when her son came out as transgender was to ensure that he felt supported and safe in his identity.
“What I learned through this journey is that being transgender is not about changing who you are, it’s about becoming who you have always been,” Keith said.

Taylor compared people’s gender identities to their religion.
“It’s something that can’t be casually changed because someone else disapproves,” Taylor said. “It is foundational to who we are, just like any belief that forms the very core of our own existence.”
But while Zanotti said celebrating trans joy has been meaningful, she added that it’s just the first step towards true acceptance.
“If these next generations are simply visible, it will not be enough,” Zanotti said. “It will now be our mission and our responsibility to make sure that transgender people are not just seen, but to make sure we are heard, and to make damn sure that we are understood.”

(Rick Kern | Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.











If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
A divided front

	
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
Cutting care at home

	
All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

Shaundelle Brooks’ bill that would criminalize knowingly giving firearms to someone who recently received inpatient mental health treatment. 
Brooks named the bill “Akilah’s Law” in honor of her son Akilah Dasilva, who was one of four killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville Waffle House in 2018.
Brooks, a Democrat, has been lobbying for tighter gun restrictions ever since, and won her seat in the House in November after running on a platform of gun safety advocacy. This is her first session as part of the Tennessee General Assembly.
“Akilah was born here in Nashville, and his life was taken here in Nashville … my son Akilah would still be here with us today if the parents of the perpetrator had followed the instructions of law enforcement, the judicial system and medical professionals who deemed their son unfit to possess a firearm,” Brooks said Wednesday. 
“Despite being instructed by each of these oversight agencies to store their firearms safely and not return them to the shooter, the parents knowingly and intentionally disregarded those instructions, broke the law and (were) subsequently held accountable because they resided in another state,” she said.
The House Criminal Justice Subcommittee voted 6-2 to advance the bill to the House’s full Judiciary Committee. The bill still faces several hurdles before it can become law.
Brooks said the bill is focused on “upholding the law and holding those who break the law accountable.”
Travis Reinking of Morton, Illinois was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in February 2022 for killing four people and injuring four others at the restaurant with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Illinois State Police had revoked Reinking’s firearm owner’s identification card prior to the shooting, requiring Reinking to surrender his guns to his father, Jeffrey Reinking.
Jeffrey Reinking returned the guns to his son, including the assault rifle used in the Waffle House shooting — an act that is illegal in the state of Illinois. The elder Reinking was sentenced to 18 months in prison in Illinois in March 2023.
Prosecutor: No punishment for shooter’s father under Tennessee law
Aldane Dasilva, Brooks’ son, was 12 when his brother Akilah was killed. For years, his family pursued accountability in court. 
“The law did not fail us,” Dasilva said. “It held both parties accountable: the father of the person that took my brother from me was held accountable using the same statute — the bill presented here today — by the courts of Illinois, because he broke the law.”
Tennessee had no such pathway for recourse.
In Tennessee, giving firearms to juveniles or people who are intoxicated are misdemeanor crimes. But Tennessee currently has no law against giving firearms to someone who has been committed for mental health evaluation. 
Nashville Assistant District Attorney Jan Norman was one of the prosecutors who prosecuted Travis Reinking for the Waffle House homicides. She testified Wednesday that she remembers talking with Brooks about the Illinois law.
“We were talking about that law and what the punishment was, and I said to her these words: ‘Shaundelle, it’s not enough. It’s not. The punishment is not enough. But thank God he gave him those guns in Illinois, because if that would have happened here in Tennessee, I couldn’t have done a thing about it. He wouldn’t have been punished at all if it happened in Tennessee,’” Norman said.

Brooks’ bill would criminalize the sale, offer of sale, delivery or transfer of a firearm to a person while knowing that the person has been a patient of a mental health institution – voluntarily or involuntarily – within the previous five years. It does not apply to people who were voluntarily admitted for treatment solely for alcohol abuse disorder who have no other secondary mental illnesses or substance abuse disorders.
Nashville-area psychiatrist Eric Zabriskie also testified in favor of the bill. He said firearms were the method used in 67% of the 1,245 deaths by suicide recorded in Tennessee in 2022. 
“If we continue to do nothing and take no preventative public mental health measures such as this bill, fewer (people) will make it back into (mental health) treatment, and more will go to the morgue and into the ground instead,” Zabriskie said.
Bill moves forward as Nashville remembers school shootings
Wednesday’s committee meeting fell during a time of remembrance and mourning in Nashville.
Thursday marked the second anniversary of a shooting at The Covenant School that killed 9-year-old students Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus, and William Kinney as well as school headmaster Katherine Koonce, custodian Mike Hill, and substitute teacher Cynthia Peak.
Amid the public outcry for gun law reforms that followed, a 2023 special legislative session of the Tennessee General Assembly called by Gov. Bill Lee ended without the passage of any bills restricting access to guns.
On Tuesday, the Metro Nashville Public Schools Board of Education honored Antioch High School staff for their actions during a January shooting. Solomon Henderson, 17, opened fire in the school’s cafeteria, killing 16-year-old Dayana Escalante and injuring another student before taking his own life.
James Shaw Jr., who wrestled the gun away from Travis Reinking and sustained injuries in the Waffle House shooting, also testified Wednesday in favor of Brooks’ bill.
3 kids, 3 adults killed in shooting at Nashville private elementary school

“I’ve just seen the outcome of (a mass shooting), and I’ve seen how it could fracture families. I’ve seen the holes it could make. I could see how the mending doesn’t happen. And, as well, I’ve seen myself the diagnoses that I’ve had, of having PTSD and having things of that nature,” Shaw said. 
“I think it’s a step in the right way for some of the other mothers that are here from (Covenant) and from Antioch and from the other shootings that we’ve had recently here in Nashville,” he continued. “I think this is a step in the right way, so I’m very supportive of her bill, and I think it will help Nashville push forward and for us to just make laws, good laws, about gun safety and practice.”
Reps. Andrew Farmer (R-Sevierville), William Lamberth (R-Portland)), Lowell Russell (R-Vonore), Rick Scarbrough (R-Oak Ridge), Jason Powell (D-Nashville) and Gabby Salinas (D-Memphis) voted in favor of advancing the bill.

The astronomical price tag includes housing, feeding, medicating and educating hundreds of youth in foster care.
The Department of Human Services paid the bulk of the price tag. Angelia Hightower, a spokesperson for the department, said that some children were removed from out-of-state programs “due to safety concerns and educational deficiencies.”
The state continues to make payments to Devereux Behavioral Health, which operates in 11 states, despite five open West Virginia investigations against the facilities involving sexual abuse and neglect. While the company is facing multiple lawsuits over child abuse allegations, the state still has children living in Devereux facilities. The most recent payment of $5,015 was in late February, according to the state auditor’s public records.
The West Virginia Department of Education, which pays for some out-of-state education for foster children, said that every out-of-state facility had some level of findings of noncompliance that are often noted under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act during fiscal year 2024. 
“No egregious findings were noted,” said Christy Day, a spokesperson for the WVDE. “There were no findings that warranted removal of students.
Devereux was last monitored in 2018, she said. “Any educational findings/violations found at that time were corrected within one year in compliance with the U.S. Department of Education,” she said. 
Keeping children in West Virginia would be much cheaper, experts say, and allow better oversight of their treatment. But with a shortage of foster homes and in-state treatment beds, West Virginia relies on out-of-state facilities to house children, typically teens with behavioral or mental health issues. 
In 2024, Neveya (West Virginia Watch is not fully identifying her to protect her privacy) ended up in Laurel Oaks in Alabama, a residential treatment facility 706 miles from Charleston. The atmosphere was chaotic, she said. 
“I hated it there. Like every other day, there was a fight, every other day there was something,” said Neveya, 18. “I also had an issue with a girl there, and she peed on my stuff.”
Nevaya, who spent her childhood living under a bridge with her mother, had been in a facility in Charleston and attending public school. In 2024, a Child Protective Services worker put Nevaya on a flight to Alabama. Nevaya said she was given no warning but was told that the Charleston facility couldn’t support her mental health needs.
School was offered on-site at Laurel Oaks, but Navaya said her education during her five months there was minimal.
“If they had a fight on the floor that day, school’s canceled,” Neveya said. “I don’t mean to speak too harshly of it, but it’s almost like prison in a way.”
DoHS has asked lawmakers, who are right now vetting state budget requests, for a 65% increase in funding for foster care.
Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, is a foster parent who has spearheaded legislation he hopes will reform the state’s troubled foster care system. He reiterated that the state doesn’t have enough in-state beds that can offer the kind of behavioral or mental health support these kids need.
“Right now is a really tough time. I know [DoHS] is aware of the problem, and they want to make this a focus. We all as a state and as a community should want to make this a focus,” Burkhammer said. 
“The ultimate goal is to get them back home, and the best case scenario would be with their family,” he continued. “These are our kids, our responsibility. We should do everything we can to get them home.”’

Court orders child out of state, agencies on hook to pay
The number of children coming into West Virginia’s foster care accelerated as the substance abuse crisis ravaged the state. The lack of available homes and beds in group homes has led to children being placed in hotel rooms and on campgrounds.
There are more than 5,800 children in state foster care. DoHS data shows that 471 are out of state, mostly in group residential care. 
By combing through the state auditor’s public data on spending, West Virginia Watch was able to track payments — a mix of federal and state dollars — to more than a dozen out-of-state facilities in FY 2024. WVDE paid more than $7 million for these facilities, according to the auditor’s records. 
Facilities were located in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah and more. One spending record showed the state paid Grafton School Residential Treatment in Virginia $687,908 last year.
Mike Folio, legal director for Disability Rights West Virginia, estimated that the state spends three times the amount of money on sending foster children out of state than it does on the ones who remain in state. His organization sued the state over alleged mistreatment of foster children, including sending them to dangerous out-of-state group homes. 
“Once they are sent out of state, they experience extreme trauma they will never recover from,” Folio said. 
Whitney Wetzel, a former DoHS spokesperson who is no longer with the agency, told West Virginia Watch in December that DoHS seeks to use out-of-state placements only when in-state services at the required level of care are unavailable. “Typically, these placements involve more intense or specialized services, which leads to increased costs,” she said.
The process for a child being sent out of state involves numerous stakeholders, and ultimately, the court makes the decision to send a child to an out-of-state facility, according to DoHS. 
“It’s important to emphasize that DoHS is one member of this selection team that recommends placements based on the child’s needs. DoHS is, however, the primary funding source and required to cover costs of court-ordered placements, even if they differ from a DoHS recommendation,” Wetzel said in an email to West Virginia Watch. 
Potential facilities to take children go through a vetting process, according to Hightower. It includes an on-site visit. Annual reviews are conducted at facilities with existing contracts to ensure compliance. 
“Social workers continue to meet the required monthly visit standards for all facilities,” Hightower said.
DoHS covers out-of-state education expenses for children who do not have an Individualized Education Program (IEP). 
The WVDE, obligated to pay for children’s education in out-of-state facilities, was invoiced for educational services for approximately 535 students in FY 2024, according to Day. Some students were listed twice due to being in multiple facilities.
The department handles the educational monitoring of these places, Day said. 
Neveya said school at Laurel Oaks was online, with an adult who was on-site to supervise if they had school for the day. There was no teacher on campus during her five months there.
“Schooling was hard. It didn’t give me much information,” she said.
Jeanette Jackson, chief executive officer for Laurel Oaks Behavioral Health Center, said any allegation at the center is thoroughly investigated. 
“Laurel Oaks Behavioral Health Hospital is committed to providing compassionate care in a safe setting to children and adolescents with psychiatric, emotional and behavioral disorders,” she wrote in an email.

Cost rising to send foster children out of state 
DoHS said they’d reduced the percentage of children in residential care from 24% to 14% over the last several years. Wetzel said they’ve tripled their spending on community-based mental health services.
A recent investigation from Mountain State Spotlight, a nonprofit newsroom, found that the state still sends children with physical or emotional disabilities to group homes and treatment centers at a rate three times the national average.
DoHS leaders recently requested more than $181 million for the foster care program in the department’s roughly $7 billion total budget request for FY 2026. It’s a 65% increase over the $110 million in the current DoHS budget for foster care.
Alex Mayer, new DoHS cabinet secretary, told lawmakers that the rising costs of out-of-state services are a budgetary risk.
“ … The limited in-state capacity and increased level of acuity among youth has also led to higher costs for out-of-state placements,” Mayer told the Senate Finance Committee on March 20. He has stressed that he is committed to working collaboratively with the Legislature to address child welfare issues. 
The state draws down federal money to help pay for children out of state. Burkhammer said federal reimbursement rates for out-of-state placements are part of the price problem.
“There could be a potential savings if we can bring those kids home and take care of them at home,” Burkhammer said.
Folio called on lawmakers to study how much the state is spending sending children out of state and, in response, invest those resources in community-based programs to keep children close to home.  
“The taxpayers will save millions of dollars,” he said. 
In February, Neveya was in Charleston, getting ready for a formal event at a nearby high school, excited to wear a long ruby red gown.
The teenager is back home in West Virginia after aging out of state care. She is living with a foster family who kept in contact with her when she was sent to Alabama. After years of poor education in facilities, they’re helping her get caught up on schooling so she can graduate.
She credits her new family and a therapist for helping her make it to this point. 
When asked what she’d tell the state foster care leaders, she replied, “I would want them to know that they need to have better facilities, because it sucked.”

Prior to the pandemic, Nebraska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was consistently around 3.0%, ranging from 2.8% to 3.2%.
Nebraska’s preliminary unemployment rate still remains among the lowest nationally, tying for fifth lowest in the recently released data that reflects February. The national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February is 4.1%, up from 3.9% a year earlier.
Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said the uptick appears to be driven by an increase in the state labor force.
“When someone enters the labor force and begins searching for work, they are classified as unemployed until they find a job,” she said. “Both new entrants and re-entrants into the labor force were up in February, and Nebraska’s labor force is now at an all-time high of 1,077,890 participants.”
The number of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey on employment status. Both individuals who are claiming unemployment benefits and those who are not claiming the benefits can be counted as unemployed based on their survey responses. 
Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are not included in the unemployment rate calculation.
The number of filled nonfarm jobs was 1,048,487 in February, up 6,569 over a year earlier. Private industries with the most growth over the past year were private education and health services (up 5,889 jobs) and mining and construction (up 1,803 jobs).

Minneapolis on Thursday has become the fourth U.S. city to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing software, joining San Francisco, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, in a growing wave of legislation aimed to protect renters from rental price-gouging.
While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.

The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
Colorado joins lawsuit alleging property management company illegally fixes rent prices

“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote.
Colorado’s House approved a similar bill last week, and it’s now headed to the Senate. House Bill 25-1004, introduced on the first day of the state’s legislative session, would regulate rent-setting computer algorithms. A report from 2024 that has since been removed from the White House website found that Denver renters who live in buildings that rely on such algorithms pay an average of $136 more per month.
Landlords resist
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. Those attorneys general include Colorado’s Phil Weiser. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

Gov. Bill Lee will include $20 million in the state’s budget for victim-serving agencies that — for weeks — have issued public pleas for help to keep their doors open in the face of steep cuts to federal grants. 
Sexual assault centers, domestic violence shelters and child abuse counseling agencies — many serving key roles in working with law enforcement to bring perpetrators to justice — have seen their share of federal Victims of Crime Act funding dwindled from a peak of $68 million in 2018 to $16 million last year.  
In response to these cuts, 35 other states took action to provide state funding. Tennessee was not one of them, until now. 
“Some of the victim services units are struggling to provide the services that are needed, particularly for our law enforcement and for the victims of crime in our state,” Jim Bryson, commissioner of the Department of Finance and Administration, said Tuesday in presenting the supplemental budget proposal to lawmakers. 
The governor’s funding — $10 million in grants for each of the next two years — fell short of the request for $25 million in recurring state funding a coalition of state nonprofits say they need to preserve current services. 
Memphis domestic violence center abruptly closes amid statewide fight for victim funding

Advocates, disappointed when the governor’s budget initially included no state funding for crime victims, nevertheless called it an important first step but are still seeking a long-term dedicated crime victim funding.
“This funding is an important acknowledgment of the urgent crisis facing Tennessee’s victim service providers,” said Stephen Woerner, executive director of Tennessee Children’s Advocacy Centers, which provides counseling and other services to children who have suffered abuse.
Woerner stressed the need for sufficient and sustained funding long-term. 
The Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA funding, relies on the fees and fines collected from individuals prosecuted in federal courts. It has seen a drastic drop in collections as prosecutors made a concerted shift to accept more plea deals — a trend that preceded the current Trump Administration.
A short-term infusion of COVID-era funding helped bridge the gap, but those funds have now ended.
Collectively, Tennessee organizations receiving VOCA grants serve more than 95,000 victims in Tennessee each year, according to the state’s Office of Criminal Justice Programs.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Some North Dakota health agencies are trying to adjust to the sudden loss of federal funding. 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services learned last week it lost about $3.2 million in federal funding for substance-use treatment and mental health programs after block grants were rescinded by a federal agency. 
In an evening email on March 24, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration told HHS that the COVID-19 pandemic-era grants were taken back in accordance with President Donald Trump’s executive order empowering the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to cut costs.
“These grants were issued for a limited purpose: To ameliorate the effects of the pandemic,” the email stated. “The end of the pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants are no longer necessary.
The grants were scheduled to expire Sept. 30.
Pam Sagness, executive director for the Behavioral Health Division for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in 2021 the department received the five block grants to target substance abuse prevention, treatment and mental health programming totaling about $9.5 million. The funding for these grants came from the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Renae Moch, public health director for Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health, said the organization received $115,000 from HHS to develop plans for a 24/7, 365-day facility to focus on crisis response, mental health and addiction services, rather than treating patients in an emergency room.
“How we were notified and how this kind of went down has just been unbelievable,” Moch said.
  Renae Moch (Provided)
She said she received a general notification from HHS last Tuesday morning that their block grant funding was going to be impacted, but she was still unclear about what that meant and what funding was being rescinded. She got a call back about 4:30 p.m. from the department, 45 minutes before she was to present and hopefully award funding from the grant during a Bismarck City Commission meeting.
“I had to kind of refocus and compose myself before going up to the meeting at 5:15 p.m.,” Moch said. The presentation and contract award were pulled from the agenda.
Sagness said 42 grantees statewide will lose federal funding.
“Our focus now is on ensuring that services continue by identifying alternative funding and working with providers to minimize disruptions,” Sagness said in a statement. “It’s important for North Dakotans to know that support remains in place. Anyone struggling should continue to reach out for help, including through (calling) 988 or their local behavioral health provider.” 
The department received notice the grants were being terminated the day the funding was rescinded, Sagness said.
Holly Scott, a spokesperson for Fargo Cass Public Health, said its state partners confirmed that its funding for social detox center operations will run out after September.
“Our leadership team is currently working to determine the impacts of these changes, while also reviewing alternate sources of funding to assure long-term sustainability,” Scott said in an email.
Other organizations impacted by the loss of block grant funding:

Connect Us Therapy, Williston – $50,000 for crisis response and law enforcement mental health support
Corner Post Counseling, Mandan – $30,000 for crisis response and law enforcement mental health support
Public Health & Tribes, 23 contracts – $200,000 for substance-use prevention
Flint Communications, Fargo – $824,951 for Parents Lead, opioid messaging initiatives and marketing statewide
BeMoreColorful, Fargo – $160,000 for behavioral health workforce tools

“All of the planning and all of the work that has gone into it and now, here we are,” Moch said.
She said they don’t want to abandon the project, but the organization is going to have to come up with alternate funding sources.
“We will be losing months,” Moch said. She’s also hopeful a new grant or funding source can be identified before the city and county begin their budget discussions over the summer.
Agriculture research loses momentum with federal payments uncertain

Separate federal funding through the Health Equity Immunization Grant was also rescinded for Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health, she said. That funding impacted the organization’s ability to provide free COVID-19 tests and a portion of the salary for a vaccine specialist.
“It’s all related to the same decision,” Moch said. She added that arguments about the pandemic being over and the funding not being needed don’t hold water because they are still working through the impacts of COVID-19. That funding was supposed to continue until 2026, Moch said.
“The abrupt impacts on us at the local level is what is just so unexpected and so we’re just really trying to scramble now because there was no notice,” she said.
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the COVID-19 pandemic has been over for three years, but he has been in contact with HHS to get a handle on the impacts to state health providers.
“I’m glad it happened during the legislative session so we can figure out how we readjust our budget and figure out how to finish off the session,” Armstrong said.
In a news release, the Department of Health and Human Services said it was evaluating funding options for the loss in federal block grants and will collaborate with other state agencies, organizations and private partners to address priority areas. The department said it will provide updates as more information becomes available.

In this January 2024 photo, an information screen for visitors at Sauk Prairie Hospital displays a recruiting message directed at health care workers. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)As more Wisconsinites need more hospital care, the supply of health care workers to provide that care remains slim — and to change that outlook will take concerted effort, according to a new report released Monday.
“Wisconsin’s health care workforce must grow faster,” says the 2025 Wisconsin Health Care Workforce Report, produced by the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA).
“Health care employers are working hard to retain current employees, re-recruit those who left for what they thought might be greener pastures and attract new talent to health care fields in Wisconsin,” the report states.
The report finds some glimmers of improvement and promising pathways for hospitals to further address their need for more trained staff. Over the last two years hospital job vacancies have fallen slightly and employment has increased.
But filling jobs remains a challenge and will remain that way for years, the report states. It suggests  a combination of strategies to overcome current trends.
Some of the strategies involve  how hospitals themselves structure jobs and hiring practices. But the report contends other sectors — government, educational institutions, and the insurance companies and government programs that pay the lion’s share of health care bills — will also need to shift their policies.
Reimbursement rates are not keeping up with increased costs as hospitals and other providers weather rising payroll and supply expenses, for example, the report finds.
By far the dominant contributor to the workforce challenges hospitals and health systems face, however, is demographic, according to the report. Wisconsinites continue to get collectively older.
“Only Wisconsin’s population over 65 has grown between the 2010 and 2020 census,” said Ann Zenk, senior vice president of workforce and clinical practice for the hospital association. The working-age population ages 18 to 65 decreased in that same period.
Those younger than 40 go to the hospital once a year on average. From ages 40 to 65 that ticks up to three times a year. After 65, “it doubles to six visits a year,” Zenk  said.
“As we age, we need more health care,” she said. “That is going to be a double challenge for hospitals because our available workers are a smaller pool and our demand is even greater.”
The population preparing to enter the workforce — people ages 19 and younger — “is not large enough to replace retiring baby boomers,” the report states. “Growing the health care workforce needed to respond to this demographic challenge will require increasing in-migration, ensuring access to career pathways and increasing interest in hospital careers.”
That starts with giving students in high school or even earlier “the opportunity to have exposure — you’re walking in the shoes of what it’s like to be a health care professional,” Zenk said.
Then there’s the education process itself — “making sure that educational pathways remain accessible,” Zenk said. The report urges policymakers not to add requirements to training programs that would make them longer, more complex or more expensive.
One promising training innovation, said Zenk, is the use of an apprenticeship program to prepare new registered nurses, pioneered in the last few years in Wisconsin by UW Health and the state Department of Workforce Development.
While the program stretches over four years for the equivalent of a two-year associate degree, she said, it also allows the participating students to “earn while you learn.” The concept is being expanded to prepare respiratory therapists.
The report also identifies generational shifts in what people expect from their jobs. Zenk said addressing demands for more flexible and family-friendly schedules can make it possible to hire and retain more successfully. But those changes may also mean demand for even more personnel.
“So where you need a roster of 10 nurses, you need 15 now to cover the exact same shift,” Zenk said.
The report also sees technology offering some relief.
Some of that might be replacing people for tasks such as registering at the front desk for a medical visit, Zenk said. But another example is monitoring equipment that could go home with a patient and be checked remotely, with nurses and clinicians visiting the patient at home every day, she observed.
Zenk said some regulations in health care can be reexamined and streamlined without endangering safety or the quality of care.
Physician assistants, for example, collaborate with and are overseen by a medical doctor. Zenk said in the past a physician could supervise no more than four PAs. That has since been relaxed, making it less burdensome for both doctor and PA alike, she said.
Zenk said another form of regulation has gotten worse, however: When health insurers interpose an increasing number of steps for them to sign off on the care a doctor or hospital provides.
“That requires staff to make those phone calls or enter that data, or requires physicians to document more and more and more to justify the care that they want to provide and that the patient needs,” she said.
She’s seen insurer-driven requirements increase in the last five years.
“That’s a major tug-of-war on clinicians’ time,” Zenk said, “and for patients also very frustrating.”
In the end, however, there’s no single silver bullet to resolve what is likely to be a persistent challenge for hospitals or their employees.
“There’s no one answer. We’re more than likely not going to be able to grow ourselves out of this one fast enough,” Zenk said. “But anything we can do to grow the workforce faster is going to help.”

“We usually will have a lot more sponsorships by now,” Fuad, communications organizer for the Providence nonprofit that empowers youth of color to fight for education justice and pursue career success, said on March 21.



401Gives starts at 6 a.m., Tuesday, April 1, and ends at 6 p.m., Wednesday April 2.

Several corporate sponsors from past years have recently emailed ARISE to say they cannot help with this year’s Visibility Event on May 8 at The Guild in Pawtucket because of changing priorities in a new political climate, Fuad said. 
It’s why there is a stronger sense of urgency for ARISE and other local nonprofit organizations that work to advance social justice as they gear up for 401Gives on Tuesday, April 1. 
About 600 nonprofit organizations serving Rhode Islanders have registered for the 6th annual 401Gives, the day of online giving that takes its name from the state’s area code. About 90 participating nonprofits are led by people of color, said Nancy Wolanski, director of the Alliance for Nonprofit Impact at the United Way of Rhode Island, which organizes the annual event.
Even before President Donald Trump President Trump signed an executive order dismantling Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs on his first day back in the White House, companies were already scaling back their DEI initiatives. Corporate charitable giving may be following suit. One high-profile example: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced in February that it was ending its “social advocacy funding,” which included racial and gender equality initiatives, to focus instead on biology and AI.
“I would definitely reaffirm that there are concerns in organizations working in DEI, organizations working in racial justice, and it’s the time for us to come together as a community to really support them,” Wolanski said. “Those organizations are seeing more difficulty in fundraising, just in general, from philanthropy, and from the federal government that has closed some funding streams.”
401Gives raised over $3.8 million last year from over 16,000 donors who supported a total of 597 different Ocean State nonprofits. ARISE raised $38,806 last year, exceeding its $35,000 goal, and engaging a total of 595 donations to win the “Most Unique Donors” award for the third year in a row. 
This year, ARISE hopes to raise at least $45,000, Fuad said. Its 2025 401Gives talking points for donors will specifically highlight the organization’s work protecting civil liberties, such as testifying in favor of the Freedom to Read Act at the State House, and co-hosting “Know Your Rights” workshops around immigration, special education and bilingual education. 
Fuad said past fundraising outreach largely focused on ARISE staff sharing stories about their work, personal development and political engagement, or ARISE youth talking about their positive feelings from participating in the organization’s leadership training and advocacy programs.
For the last three years, ARISE has won a prize for peer-to-peer fundraising for small organizations — those having annual budgets between $151,000 and $500,000 — for its success in enlisting the help of alumni, staff, volunteers and the youth who participate in its programs. They send texts, promote times when matching gifts are available and share updates on group chats throughout the day. This year, youth participants working as a team have been given a goal to raise $4,000, Fuad said.
Starting at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, the first $20,000 raised during 401Gives will be matched by the Papitto Opportunity Connection. The maximum match per donor, per nonprofit, is $500. Last year, the early morning match lasted for just under two minutes. ARISE’s entire board, staff members and other supporters set their alarms to be ready to make a donation to secure matching dollars before the threshold is reached, Fuad said. 
Other matches are offered at noon and 4:01 p.m. on the first day. Online giving continues through 6 p.m. on Wednesday, April 2. The short fundraising window helps fuel “one big burst of collective energy,” Fuad said.
“It’s a really good energizer for us,” Fuad added. “We connect with our base, and it’s a reminder that this work is very community-led, that we really need individual donors to buy into our mission and buy into our work and buy into our programming.”
Likewise for Rhode Island Black Storytellers (RIBS). The Providence nonprofit dedicated to performing and sharing stories from Black history and culture in school programs and public performances has participated in 401Gives since its inception in 2020. RIBS raised $10,528 last year from a total of 118 donors, more than doubling its goal of $5,000.

Funding operations too
This year, RIBS set a goal to raise $25,000, said RIBS Executive/Festival Director and founding member Valerie Tutson. The fact that the contributions are unrestricted and can go towards general operating expenses is a big deal, she added.
“The challenge is, since our programming has grown, how do we support the operation?” Tutson said. “That’s why for us 401Gives are so important.”
Just last week, a bank’s charitable foundation delivered disappointing news to RIBS on a $25,000 grant it had applied for.
“The response to us was, ‘We have changed our funding priorities,’” Tutson said. “That was the wording that came from them.”
RIBS received a $10,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts last year to support its Funda Fest, a 10-day Black storytelling celebration every January with performances at schools and public and private venues that takes its name from the Zulu word for “to speak/learn.”
“It was kind of an entry level grant to help an organization like RIBS, which doesn’t have a full-time development person and might not have all the time and resources to navigate how a governmental grant proposal goes in,” Tutson said. “(They) eliminated that program and now all organizations have to go into the same pool.”
RIBS was founded in 1998. Before the rise of DEI, its community outreach emphasized multiculturalism and strengthening literacy education and now will continue to do so, Tutson said.
“We’ve always been the Rhode Island Black Storytellers,” Tutson said. “It’s only been the last few years that we’ve been able to say, ‘Hey, if you’re concerned about justice, then you can really support our work.’”
On its 401Gives profile page, the group says it does not just tell Black stories but wants to help others do the same. “RIBS knows it is important for Black communities to know their own history and culture, and for others to experience Black culture presented by Black people,” it reads.

Barbara Brown, Kendra Drone-North and Sheila Beal all filed separate complaints against the BLR in 2024 — April, May and September, respectively — in the U.S. District Court [&#8230;]","(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Three African American women are suing the Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Research in federal court, alleging they experienced racial discrimination while working for the nonpartisan state agency.
Barbara Brown, Kendra Drone-North and Sheila Beal all filed separate complaints against the BLR in 2024 — April, May and September, respectively — in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Little Rock civil rights attorney Austin Porter Jr. is representing all three plaintiffs.

B. Brown complaint redacted 
The BLR assists members of the General Assembly with drafting legislation, researching state policies and financial matters and codifying legislation that becomes law, among other things.
The three plaintiffs claim their non-Black superiors at the BLR, including Director Marty Garrity, failed to promote them into jobs for which they were qualified and instead hired less experienced non-Black employees, despite the plaintiffs’ positive performance evaluations. They also claim the BLR retaliated against them for complaining about the discrimination.
The jury trial in Brown’s case is scheduled to begin Oct. 6 in U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker’s courtroom. Drone-North’s case will go to trial Dec. 9 with U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky presiding.
U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. is responsible for Beal’s case, and the trial is scheduled for June 2027, according to court documents.
All three women filed complaints against the BLR with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2023. The plaintiffs claim the discrimination was based on age in addition to race, and they assert that the BLR violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects people from employment discrimination on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”

North complaint redacted 
The BLR, represented by the state Attorney General’s office, filed responses to each complaint in which it denied the allegations of discriminatory and retaliatory behavior.
Beal and Drone-North were fired from BLR before filing their lawsuits. The BLR’s response to Brown’s complaint in August 2024 states she was “currently an employee of BLR.”
Brown’s complaint alleges that Garrity and other BLR administrators repeatedly told her she had “not yet met the years of experience qualification” for promotions and pay increases. The BLR admitted this claim in its response but denied the allegation that non-Black employees were promoted without meeting the “years of experience” standard to which it held Brown.
The BLR repeatedly denied in its response to Drone-North’s complaint that younger, less qualified white women regularly received promotions the plaintiff sought.
The agency admitted in its response to Beal’s complaint that an employee who had worked at the BLR for less than a year received a promotion in “violation of BLR policy.” Beal’s complaint states that the other employee had been at the BLR for less than a year, the minimum amount of experience required before a promotion.

Beal complaint redacted 
The BLR also asserted in its responses that sovereign immunity nullifies the plaintiffs’ claims. Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
Additionally, Brown and Drone-North failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing lawsuits, according to the BLR.
Garrity declined to comment on the pending litigation Thursday when reached by email, saying she would “let the responses speak for themselves.” Megan Markham, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin, said in an email that the office “will continue vigorously defending the case.”
 Legislative involvement

While the BLR is a defendant in all three lawsuits, the State of Arkansas is also a defendant in Brown’s suit because the Arkansas Legislative Council’s executive subcommittee had “knowledge and willful disregard for Ms. Brown’s civil and employee rights,” her complaint states.
The executive subcommittee is responsible for overseeing appeals of investigative reports into discrimination complaints against state agencies. Brown filed a complaint against the BLR in early 2021, and the subcommittee met to discuss the issue, as reflected in both Brown’s legal complaint and the panel’s April 2021 meeting agenda.
The panel’s May 2023 agenda similarly states that it discussed a BLR “personnel matter.” Such discussions are not open to the public.
Brown and Drone-North both filed EEOC complaints in February 2023, and the BLR hired Little Rock attorney Carolyn Witherspoon to investigate, according to both women’s legal filings.
“However, rather than truly investigating the plaintiff’s complaint of discrimination, Carolyn Witherspoon looked for ways to nullify the plaintiff’s complaint,” Drone-North’s legal complaint states.
Brown claimed the BLR retaliated against her for “providing aid and agreeing to be a witness” in Drone-North’s complaint to the EEOC. Brown said the BLR used this as a reason to reprimand her; the agency denied this allegation in its response to her complaint.
The legislative subcommittee voted to affirm Witherspoon’s findings and reject the two appeals at the May 2023 meeting. The findings included that Drone-North’s EEOC complaint “did not have merit,” her legal complaint states.

Brown was mentioned by name during the public portion of the meeting before the votes, while Drone-North was not. However, the subcommittee was “concerned about the veracity and the accuracy of many statements made during the investigation” into Drone-North’s complaint, said the panel’s then-vice chairman, Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs.
Drone-North was fired from the BLR the following day, while Brown “was reprimanded” and experienced “consequences” later that month, according to both legal complaints.
Four months later, the Legislative Council’s Claims Review and Litigation Reports Oversight subcommittee was tasked with approving a $15,000 mediation settlement agreement between Drone-North and the BLR over her EEOC complaint, according to documents that have since been removed from the Legislature’s website. The subcommittee’s Sept. 13, 2023, meeting was canceled, meaning there was no action for the full council to approve later that day, though the matter was listed on the council’s agenda.
Drone-North’s complaint does not mention the potential settlement.

9.13.23 Exhibit J.01 - Emergency Action ALC Claims 
Meanwhile, Garrity fired Beal in February 2024 after Beal responded negatively to Garrity reprimanding her, according to the legal complaint. Beal claimed the reprimand was retaliation after she filed her second discrimination complaint to EEOC a few months prior. She was fired a month after the death of her son, of which Garrity was aware, Beal’s legal complaint states.
All three plaintiffs request back pay, compensatory damages, attorney fees and declarations that the BLR engaged in unlawful employment practices. Beal and Drone-North seek re-employment by the BLR; Brown seeks an injunction against the BLR engaging in further discrimination, as well as a formal promotion into the BLR position for which she claims she carried out the responsibilities but did not receive the title or appropriate pay.
 Legal representation

Porter, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said the three lawsuits are unlikely to be combined into a class-action lawsuit, which consists of a group of plaintiffs claiming the same injury and representing others who are not involved in the litigation.
Porter specializes in civil rights and employment discrimination litigation. In January, he testified against the eventual Act 116 of 2025, which Republican lawmakers claimed would force public entities to prioritize “merit” over “preferential treatment” in contracting and hiring practices.
“‘Merit,’ in a lot of people’s minds, means simply white,” Porter told a Senate committee.
The state’s Republican-led Legislature doesn’t seem to “have any interest” in protecting the state’s Black employees, who currently fill “a large part” of lower-level positions, Porter told the Advocate Tuesday.
In 2017, Porter represented Doris Smith in federal court when she alleged that the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration discriminated against her as a Black woman. Smith’s allegations were similar to those of the BLR complainants: she claimed the finance department failed to promote and pay her equitably to her white counterparts, retaliated against her for complaining about the apparent discrimination and fired her in 2018 after she filed a formal complaint.
A jury ruled in Smith’s favor in June 2020, awarding her $223,333.81 in back pay and $108,000 in compensatory damages. She was later reinstated as a finance department employee.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The League of Women Voters of Kentucky joined with other advocacy groups at the Capitol Rotunda on March 28 for the Democracy Principle Rally. Why? Because our representative democracy rests on a fundamental principle: We, the people, have a right to participate in decisions that affect us. 
The League of Women Voters of Kentucky has documented how Kentucky’s legislative process, since 1998, has been manipulated in ways that increasingly minimize public input, stifling full and open debate on significant legislation.
The 2025 legislative session was no exception, with numerous bills passed and sent to the governor using fast-track maneuvers and undemocratic tactics, often in combination. Legislators used combinations like these:

File a “shell bill” with minor changes to existing law and assign it to a standing committee.
Rush a bill by holding bill readings on the chamber floor before the committee even discusses and votes on the bill.
Reschedule committee meetings with short notice to the public.
In committee, introduce and vote on a substitute bill that some committee members cannot access before the meeting and the public has not seen.
Send the bill for a floor vote that same day, giving non-committee legislators and their constituents little time to review the new language.
Then, the shenanigans rinse-and-repeat in the next chamber. 
 If such strategies produce a bill different from the originating chamber, specially appointed committees can produce yet another version for a final vote before the public and many legislators have time to review.

These strategies not only interfere with public participation, but legislators themselves may have limited access to bill substitutes before a vote, let alone journalists whose job it is to inform the public. Overall, these fast-tracking methods are unnecessarily hasty and may lead to careless mistakes or laws that are out of step with public opinion. Lawmaking should not be reduced to power plays, but be approached with careful consideration of intended and unintended consequences. 
KY legislature again excluded public via fast-track maneuvers, says League of Women Voters

Among the bills that were passed using one or more of these maneuvers were:

HB 4, restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and constraining instruction in public postsecondary institutions. 
HB90, originally focused on free-standing birthing centers, but last-minute additions included abortion-related provisions. 
HB241, a two-page bill allowing school districts to adjust calendars due to weather-related emergencies had multiple provisions about virtual education programs added on the Senate floor. 
HB 695, included last-minute changes to the state Medicaid program by adding mandatory work requirements for able-bodied adults. 
HB 775, a four-page bill on development districts that transformed to a 108-page bill making substantive taxation changes beyond development districts. 
SB 202, a five-page shell bill making innocuous word changes that became a 60-page bill to regulate the sale of cannabis-infused beverages.

Prior to these past two sessions, the League made recommendations to the General Assembly on how to strengthen public participation by respecting the Democracy Principle. We described how Kentucky’s Constitution, laws and legislative process rules actually provide opportunities for public participation in the lawmaking process. We urged the legislature to respect these constitutional and statutory requirements alongside its own procedural rules.
The 2025 legislative session lacks evidence that the General Assembly has taken these recommendations to heart. That’s why we took the message to the Capitol on the last day of the session, to unequivocally affirm that there should be no laws about us, without us. That is the heart of the Democracy Principle, and we will not let the people be ignored.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3756-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 06:02:06.278286

Tina Spears called The Rhode Island Social Media Regulation Act were to succeed in the Rhode Island General Assembly. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Some things a Rhode Islander can do for the first time, legally, when they turn 18: Vote for president, visit a casino, or smoke a pack of cigarettes. 
A bill introduced by Rep. Tina Spears, a Charlestown Democrat, in the Rhode Island House of Representatives last week would add “use social media” to that list of coming-of-age privileges. 
“What it really does is it prohibits direct messaging on accounts for these youth who are under 18,” Spears said while introducing her bill Thursday, “They will not be able to use the platforms as they are currently structured today.” 
Spears reminded her colleagues on the Rhode Island House Committee on Innovation, Internet and Technology that the U.S. Surgeon General successfully curtailed smoking rates over time, and the same office recently cast youths’ social media usage in the same light. 
“The Surgeon General states, ‘We cannot conclude that social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents,’ which tells me as a policymaker and lawmaker, that we should be taking action to ensure that we are protecting our youth,” Spears told the committee, citing that youth often come into contact with self-harm content online.
Spears’ bill, The Rhode Island Social Media Regulation Act is a comprehensive effort to age-restrict social media usage and would require global social media platforms with more than five million users to verify the age of any Rhode Island user. Minors would not be able to make or use an account without their parent or guardian’s consent, and users would have two weeks to verify their identities.
Spears posed the bill as a public health effort as well as an attempt to shut off the illicit channels and activities young people can encounter in sparsely regulated online spaces.
“We do not allow drug trafficking, human trafficking, sextortion — any of those actions we do not allow in public venues in any way. Nor should we allow it on a social media platform,” the lawmaker said.
In addition to the restrictions on DMs, parents would have access to their children’s accounts, and minors would not be able to access social media sites between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. without parental consent.  
Pure direct messaging apps “where messages are shared between the sender and the recipient, only visible to the sender and the recipient,” as the bill text puts it, would presumably exclude services like Signal and WhatsApp from the bill’s reach. But it’s unclear whether something like Discord, which is a messaging app with social-media-esque aspects, would be subject to the proposed law.
Companies who violate the regulation would see a $2,500 fine per violation, and a $5,000 penalty for repeat violations. The bill imagines the Department of Business Regulation would oversee the regulatory process, although Spears told the committee, “They don’t feel they’re equipped to actually oversee this,” and have suggested pursuing other options for the regulatory framework. 
There’s no equivalent bill on the Senate side currently. Spears’ bill has some slight bipartisan support, thanks to House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale of Foster signing on as a cosponsor.

‘You cannot trust what they’re doing on these, right?’
Another bill heard in the same committee meeting led by Rep. Megan Cotter, an Exeter Democrat, features five of the same sponsors as Spears’ bill. It would require companies which provide online services youth are likely to access to keep minors in mind when designing their platforms and is based on a similar law in California that passed in 2022.
“I just want to preface first that I’m in full support of Representative Spears’ bill. My bill is slightly different. If I had a choice, I would choose hers over mine, to be clear,” Cotter said with a laugh as she sat before the House committee.
Cotter said her bill derives from a parent’s love — and concern. “When we first have a child, you get your first car seat for your child, go down to the police station…[and] make sure you’ve put it in your car safely,” Cotter said. 
Then Cotter held up her phone and added, “Then they get to teenage years, and we give them one of these, and you cannot trust what they’re doing on these, right? We kind of know there are no guardrails for them.” 
Cotter said she “expected the tech lobbyists” to lobby against her bill. 
After Cotter presented her bill, tech committee Chair Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, said, “Mom’s intuition should never be ignored. I think some of those big tech lobbyists you mentioned, I don’t know, maybe they’re in the crowd.”
No tech industry lobbyists testified at the hearing, but a few did submit written letters of opposition to Spears’ bill — all of them attached the names of national lobbying outfits, including NetChoice and the Chamber of Progress, the latter a trade group started by a former public policy executive at Google. 
Brianna January, the Chamber of Progress’s director of state and local government relations for the northeast, argued against the bill on several fronts in her written testimony, pointing to potential damage it would wreak on users and platforms alike. Websites may opt out entirely of the age verification process to avoid the hassle, January wrote, and “may turn entirely to children’s programming and eliminate all content for adults, turning YouTube into YouTube kids for everyone.” 
There could also be consequences for already marginalized teens who rely on social media and messaging for support and community, January wrote, especially LGBTQ+ youth who may “face unsafe or abusive home environments,” she wrote.
Concerns about privacy and the safety of young users also appeared in live testimony against Spears’ bill from Madalyn McGunagle, a policy associate at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island. McGunagle argued that social media can be “where a child finds social support that they don’t have at home, as well as a community and like-minded peers,” as well as a venue for political and civic engagement.
“Does the ACLU have a position on criminal activity and exposure to youth on these platforms? Do you possess a position on that?” Spears asked McGunagle. 
“Not off the top of my head,” McGunagle said. “I would be happy to look into that for you.”
Both Spears’ and Cotter’s bills were held for further study, as is standard practice at an initial hearing. Both bills would also go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, if enacted.

Age gates popping up across the states 
A number of state legislatures have had success in cracking down on teenager’s social media use and have instituted similar bills. As of June 2024, 10 states had enacted such legislation, according to The Age Verification Providers Association, a trade group.
Enforcement can still be difficult, as detailed in a 2024 article by PC Mag, given that age verification methods — from photo IDs to facial recognition — each have drawbacks. Legal challenges to age-verification laws have been plentiful, although judges’ interpretations of verification laws’ legality varies. In March, a U.S. judge in Florida struck down tech companies’ challenge to a block on platforms’ use of “addictive” features with minors, The Florida Phoenix reported. But in Texas, a judge sided with the tech industry, temporarily blocking provisions of a law regulating minors’ access to certain kinds of content, calling it “unconstitutionally vague,” according to The Texas Tribune.  
Measures to shape how and what kids access online also exist at the congressional level, with a piece of legislation called the Kids Off Social Media Act, introduced by Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii in January and buoyed by bipartisan support. Its cosponsors include Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, as well as Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent. 
Potentially more enforceable are bills which latch onto teenagers’ internet use at a location already regulated: school. At least 19 states had cell phone restrictions in school buildings as of June 2024, Education Week reported.
On Wednesday, the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education heard a bill by Sen. Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat, that would require school districts to set cell phone usage policies for their schools. Cell phone bans in public schools have become popular tools to mitigate waning classroom attention spans, with statewide bans seen in places as ideologically diverse as California and Florida, Stateline reported in February. The bill saw a healthy amount of support in written testimonies to the Senate committee.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)When Hurricane Helene tore through western Yancey County, Steve Boyd was one of thousands in the area who lost internet access.
The 70-year-old retiree, who lives outside of Burnsville, knows he got lucky. He didn’t lose his house, or his belongings — just a couple nearby trees that knocked out the power. For days after, getting back online was an afterthought.
“You don’t even think about internet when you don’t have lights, or anything else,” Boyd said.
His home, which sits off a miles-long county road, had been connected by coaxial cable. Shortly before the storm, he’d bought a new wi-fi system and new computers for him and his wife. But six months later, he’s still without internet. His provider, formerly a local shop that was later bought up by a larger company, has been working to restore service; he stops by their office daily.
Eventually, he broke down and decided to try out Starlink, the buzzy satellite internet service owned by SpaceX and Elon Musk. Boyd drove out to Best Buy and bought a $350 residential kit. When he got home, he set it up, only to realize there was a waitlist in the region. He paid $9 to get on it.
Many in western North Carolina impacted by Helene are now back online, after even the largest companies struggled to get service back up and running in the weeks after the storm. But the state isn’t just looking at getting access back to pre-Helene levels — it wants the entire state to have steady internet access.
It was set to be a long, complex process, even before Helene. Statewide connectivity means using a patchwork of solutions to reach communities like Boyd’s, investing hundreds of millions of dollars and navigating federal regulations that are about to see major changes.
All the while, natural disasters remain top of mind. When the mountains got hit, the whole region went off the grid. Can North Carolina prevent it from happening again?
Swaths of NC remain offline or underserved. The path to getting connected is complicated
Many parts of North Carolina remain either without stable internet or limited to slow speeds. Many of those places are rural communities — but not all of them. 
Parts of Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the state’s most populous areas, still struggle with limited connectivity. But the most challenging regions to get online are the rural ones: parts of the northern Piedmont, and long stretches of the southwest.

“We have the second largest rural population in the country,” said Angie Bailey, the director of North Carolina’s broadband infrastructure office, in an interview with NC Newsline. 
“So it’s those people in those areas that are sparsely populated, and it’s also figuring out how to work with broadband providers so they can get a return on investment.”
In total, there are more than 213,000 “unserved” locations across North Carolina, according to Federal Communications Commission data from June 2024. Those places have less than a 25 megabit per second download speed and three megabit per second upload speed. An additional 130,000 locations are “underserved,” with higher but still subpar speeds.
But finding agreement between locals and government surveyors on where exactly wiring is needed isn’t always easy, as one North Carolinian told attendees of a recent panel on rural broadband.
“I have verified the same hog house four times, that it doesn’t need power,” said Erna Bright, who has led broadband expansion efforts in northeast Gates County. “The satellite picture says it’s there, it’s unserved. Well, that pig doesn’t know how to use it.”
In the state’s most remote communities, laying fiber lines for just a few homes often doesn’t equal profits for prominent fiber companies. So officials have to look to other methods: wireless systems that bounce signals off mountains, or satellite connections like Starlink.

Still, some advocates are wary of those regions getting the short end of the stick in the process.
“It feels a lot like rural America doesn’t matter to the people who are making those decisions,” said Sara Nichols, an energy and economic development manager for Land of Sky Regional Council. “Because rural America has been given the ‘alternative technology solutions’ time and time again, that doesn’t quite meet their needs. Or it doesn’t meet them for long enough, because the technology changes pretty quickly.”
‘Building for resiliency’: How North Carolina can prevent hurricane blackouts in the future
Nobody knows whether it will be eastern or western North Carolina that takes the brunt of the next storm. But there’s no question that there will be a next storm.
“I’m not sure people thought about resiliency in the same way before the storm as they do now,” said Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe). “People just didn’t imagine that mountainsides were going to slide down.”
Part of the federal requirements for broadband projects is having safety nets in place — for both regional residents and first responders during emergencies. But state officials will have to decide how to build them — and how much to spend.
A new contract signals one key part of that plan — Starlink, Musk’s low-earth orbit satellite service. The state plans to buy kits from the company for local governments and emergency officials to use during disaster scenarios.

“We see them as a huge, important partner,” said Bailey, the state broadband office director. “A huge resource for the state and country.”
The world’s richest man garnered praise and headlines when he suspended Starlink charges in western North Carolina directly after the storm, and had additional equipment flown into the region. State lawmakers, after struggling to find kits, had “backchanneled with some of Musk’s people” to get more dropped off, said state Rep. Jake Johnson (R-Polk). 
The Republican lawmaker envisions a library-esque loaner system with Starlink kits in the future, where residents can “check out” a unit and pay the annual subscription fee.
“Really, you’re just no-interest financing it from the state,” Johnson said.
Concerns remain among some about Starlink as a permanent solution. Months after the storm, there’s a lengthy regional waitlist for residents who want to boot up and get connected. And others are wary of Musk’s close ties to the Trump administration.
“Obviously, I think there are real corruption problems that we’re going to have to manage going forward,” Ager said. “I don’t think we know what those are yet, but we certainly don’t want people making decisions about the federal government having the ability to enrich themselves.”
Money for hurricane-safe upgrades could come through extra federal money that doesn’t get spent on connection needs. Bailey said any money that’s left over could be used to address redundancies, as well as amping up cellular connections. 
And Johnson predicted there would be a hefty chunk left from a $100 million program to replace fiber poles. It could be used to buy Starlinks, he said, or to upgrade communications for fire departments, shelters and county emergency staff.
“That was kind of the worst part of the storm — that nobody could talk to each other for a long time,” Ager said. “Communication got really difficult. And that was true for emergency responders as well as just regular people.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages2025-HeleneRecovery-BatCave-SeanRayford-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-31 06:02:06.278286

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on March 27, 2025, ordered top Trump administration officials to preserve records of their messages sent on the messaging app Signal from March 11 to March 15 following a transparency watchdog group’s lawsuit alleging that the officials have violated the Federal Records Act.
This marked the latest development since The Atlantic on March 24 published a Signal chat among Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other national security officials discussing specific plans to attack Houthi militants in Yemen. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief at The Atlantic, was mistakenly included in the chat and wrote about what he saw.
Trump administration officials have shared contrasting accounts about whether they were discussing sensitive war information on Signal – but maintain that they did not share classified information.
Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Senate Arms Services committee, and Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat chairing the committee, on March 27 requested an investigation into how the Trump officials used Signal to discuss military strikes.
Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor, spoke with national security scholar Dakota Rudesill to better understand what constitutes classified information and how the government typically handles its most closely kept secrets.

How are government officials supposed to communicate about classified information?
The first way someone with the proper clearance can communicate about classified information is in person. They can talk about secret things in what is called a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF. This means a secure place, often with a big, heavy door and a lock on it, where security officials have swept the area for bugs and no one can easily eavesdrop. People who are in SCIFs usually have to leave their cell phones outside of the room, and then they can talk freely about secret information. A SCIF can be a particular room, or a floor of a building, or even an entire building.
Second, there is print communication: written documents with classification markings, which have to be handled in really particular ways, like in a safe location, and can be transported between SCIFs in secure containers.
Third, intelligence agencies, the White House and the Department of Defense also all have secure electronic systems. These include visual teleconferences, which are similar to a Zoom call and are secure for discussing highly classified information, as well as secure email systems and secure phones.
Many people with clearances have what is called “high side” email, which is shorthand lingo for classified email and messaging. Many people with security clearance would have two work hard drives and two computers. One of them is “low side,” where there is access to unclassified official email, documents and the internet.
All of these methods of secure communication can be clunky and take more time than people in our smartphone age are used to. That is the cost of protecting the nation’s secrets. My sense is the Trump administration officials wanted to move fast and turned to Signal, a commercial app that promises encryption. Signal is generally considered secure but is not perfect. There is abundant public evidence that Signal is not totally secure and indeed has been penetrated by Russian intelligence.
Can something be declassified after the information has been shared?
Yes. The president can classify and declassify at will via oral or written instruction.
The president’s constitutional powers include removing classification controls after information has been released or leaked. Trump could at any point declassify the information shared on Signal. Several of the Cabinet-level officials on that Signal chat also have expansive delegated powers over classification.
Even so, Trump’s national security Cabinet would have presumably still violated the law. For example, by putting national defense information inappropriately on an insecure app and not checking to verify the clearances of everyone on the chat and thereby allowing a reporter to be present, one could reasonably conclude that the team was showing “gross negligence,” running afoul of the Espionage Act.
The Espionage Act, enacted in 1917, criminalizes unauthorized retention and dissemination of sensitive information that could undermine the national security of the U.S. or help a foreign country.
Was the information shared on Signal likely classified?
Looking at the Signal message transcript that The Atlantic shared, it seems like at least four things were all but surely classified.
The most obvious was the details that Secretary of Defense Hegseth provided on the strike plans. These include the precise times that planes were taking off, what kind and when the bombs would fall. Recent reports have quoted defense officials confirming that this information at the time was classified.
Second, the chat revealed that the president gave a green light for secret strikes at a Situation Room meeting.
Third, there is the mere fact of these top officials deciding whether and when to execute attacks authorized by the president.
And fourth, according to media reports, the chat included the name of an intelligence officer whose position may have been secret.
The Trump administration says that there was no classified information in the chat. But several analysts have noted that defies belief. The exception would be a prior decision to declassify, but we have no evidence of that.
What other issues does this bring to mind?
First, we don’t know whether the Trump officials carefully thought about it before they set up this chat on Signal, which the Pentagon has warned government officials against using because of hacking concerns.
Second, even if the officials did make a focused decision to use Signal, what is the wisdom of that? I find it really, really hard to imagine that was a prudent decision when we think about how insecure this app is. There is also the fact that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and the Middle East, was party to the chat while he was in Russia. We do not know for sure if he had a device running Signal on him personally while he was in Russia, but in any event he would have been under intense Russian surveillance.
A broader issue is how the Trump administration is enforcing the law is a giant question mark. Usually, the law both authorizes the U.S. government to do things, and also says it cannot do things. Law enables and limits everyone, including the president. However, Trump wrongly claims that he is the final authority on the law, and so far the Justice Department only seems to be enforcing the law against people outside of the administration.
So does the law limit the Trump administration in any practical sense? Right now it is not clear – and there is abundant reason to be concerned about that from a rule of law standpoint.

National Heritage Areas are “lived-in landscapes” that are “representative of the national experience through the physical features that remain and the traditions that have evolved in them,” as defined by the Park Service. 
The Great Dismal Swamp is an environmental and cultural treasure, home to dozens of species of animals and, at one time, groups of Native Americans and formerly enslaved people who used it as a pathway to freedom.
The important details of where the conceptual boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp’s National Heritage Area would lie and who would manage any conservation, recreation and education opportunities remain unanswered questions at the moment. 
Sometime in 2026, the Park Service plans to submit a feasibility study to Congress that will answer those questions. Congress will have the final say on whether the region is suited for the federal designation. 
There are currently 62 designated National Heritage Areas in 36 states and territories. The unique federal designation does not result in any land transfers, local zoning changes or easements.

The entire state of Tennessee is a designated National Heritage Area, and the rights of landowners are not affected by the designation.
“A lot of people fear government overreach…” said John Warren, Communications Specialist at the National Park Service Northeast Region. 
“There’s no such federal footprint in a National Heritage Area. It is entirely something that the local community takes on and runs itself.”
Any federal funding for the proposed National Heritage Area would come by way of congressional appropriation. 
“A lot of those National Heritage Areas may receive up to $1 million annually, but others get a lot less,” said Warren. National Heritage Areas must receive matching funds from non-federal sources as well. 
The role of the National Park Service is to be a partner and advisor to the actual manager of the Heritage Area, called the “local coordinating entity,” an organization within the community chosen to interpret the history and traditions of the area and manage the conservation, recreation and education goals laid out by the project. 
 Creating a National Heritage Area

During virtual meetings held last week, members of the public shared their ideas on the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area’s potential location, its coordinating entity, and the natural, cultural and historic resources the region has to offer.

The public was also asked if opportunities exist for improving the quality of those resources through conservation, recreation and education. Comments are encouraged to be submitted in writing online, by mail or over the phone until May 19.
The public comments are not meant to be a vote, said Warren, but “a way to collect information.”
“The study has 10 criteria, and the answer to all of these has got to be ‘yes’ for us to be able to give a favorable conclusion that, yes, this qualifies as a National Heritage Area,” said Warren. “So it’s a high bar.” 
Warren said that anecdotally, over the last ten years only about half of the National Heritage Areas that were applied for ended up receiving the designation from Congress. 
As part of the study, the National Park Service staff has also spoken with potential state and local partners as well as possible coordinating entities. Chesapeake City Council has voiced interest in assuming the managing role, said Julie Bell, cultural resource project manager for the Park Service.
Nonprofits, universities, and state and local governments are some examples of coordinating entities that were chosen to manage other Heritage Areas around the nation. Any entity outside of the federal government is allowed to assume the role, including Indigenous tribes, said Bell. 
The Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area will involve coordination across state lines since the Virginia-North Carolina border slices directly through the swamp. 
In 2003, the Northern Neck National Heritage Area was established along with six others around the nation. The designation was Virginia’s third National Heritage Area to date. 
Two other possible National Heritage Areas have completed their feasibility studies and are currently awaiting a decision from Congress: the Finger Lakes Region in New York and the Kentucky Wildlands. 
 The story of the swamp

  An 1862 painting of the Great Dismal Swamp titled “Slaves Escaping Through the Swamp” by Thomas Moran (Photo courtesy of the National Park Service)
The National Park Service is developing themes that are present in the Great Dismal Swamp region to tell a nationally distinctive heritage story. One theme is “a place of refuge” and another is “a field of conflict.” 
Based on artifacts found in the Great Dismal Swamp dating back over 5,000 years, the Nansemond, Meherrin, Yeopim and Lumbee people were likely stewards of the swamp long before European colonists arrived, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
After colonization, the role of the swamp for local communities changed. About 50,000 self-emancipated African Americans, called maroons, along with free Blacks, Indigenous people and Europeans lived in the swamp in search of refuge. 
Some used it as a pause point on their journeys north, making the swamp an official water-based rest stop on the Underground Railroad, but others settled permanent communities there up until the end of the Civil War. 
Today, the Great Dismal Swamp is protected by a 113,000 acre National Wildlife Refuge managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. What is now a vast, uninhabited landscape is actually just a remnant of its former self. 
The once enormous swamp covered over 1 million acres, roughly the size of Delaware, but was drained over the years, first by a young George Washington in 1763. 
Washington and other investors initially aimed to create land in the swamp that could be sold for profit, then to dig a canal to transport goods across the swamp. Enslaved people were forced to provide the labor for these early economic ventures.  
One of the most successful business opportunities in the swamp turned out to be logging. The now globally rare Atlantic white cedar was in high demand, and gaining access to the trees required digging ditches to drain the swamp. By the 1950s, the last of the virgin timber in the Great Dismal Swamp was gone, according to a National Park Service story map. 
 The future of the swamp 

On George Washington’s birthday in 1973, about 50,000 acres of swamp land was donated to the Nature Conservancy and then handed over to the Fish & Wildlife Service, thus creating the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. 
“We have discovered that swamps actually play a vital role in our environment and that they are necessary,” said Warren. “You know, they’re not just places that we want to avoid because they have a lot of mosquitos or something like that. They’re places that are useful to the environment.” 
The Fish and Wildlife Service says the swamp serves as a permanent and migratory home for roughly 50 species of mammals, 200 types of birds and 100 species of butterflies. The diverse ecosystem ranges from bald cypress to red maple and Virginia’s last historic refuge of native Atlantic white cedar. 
In addition to the habitat the swamp provides to wildlife, it also prevents floods and improves water quality in nearby communities with a combined population of nearly 1 million people, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
A 2017 project to re-moisten the peat soils of the swamp served to benefit the surrounding population, including in Suffolk, by restoring a more natural water regime in the area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners installed adjustable dams in key places to regulate the amount of water leaving the swamp, improving the environment’s ability to provide its once inherent benefits. 
The re-moistened peat is now able to absorb stormwater more efficiently, acting like a sponge to reduce flooding during severe weather such as the storms and hurricanes that are common in the region. Healthy peat also stores more carbon, a valuable tool in combating global climate change. 
“This is a region that has already changed a lot,” said Warren. Creating a National Heritage Area “may have some influence on that, or it may not.” Those decisions would be left to the local community and the chosen coordinating entity.

The FAA, along with other federal agencies, faced big cuts and employees were sent buyout offers at the start of the year by President Donald Trump’s administration, which is set on cutting “wasteful” spending. Some of the FAA positions cut focused on inspection and airport operations. 
U.S. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in January the buyouts offered could have negatively impacted the number of certified air traffic controllers.
“What happens if a few thousand air traffic controllers take that?” Warner said to DC News Now. “We won’t have air traffic potentially. It takes 18 months to get an air traffic controller trained up.”
However, Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau expressed a positive sign last week when he said the agency has made progress in addressing the nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers. He stated that approximately 7,500 applicants are now being referred for testing to help fill the shortage of about 3,000 controllers.
“I’m thrilled to see that early results of (the) air traffic controller hiring supercharge were so promising. By prioritizing a merit-based process, cutting red tape, and increasing starting salaries, we are bringing in the best and brightest across America to help keep our skies secure at record speeds,” Rocheleau said in a statement.
The results come after Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy’s Feb. 27 hiring announcement for candidates.
 What’s driving the air traffic controller shortage?

The shortage of air traffic controllers responsible for ensuring the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system has been a long-simmering problem. Several factors contribute to the dearth of workers, including the FAA’s specific and lengthy training and certification process, antiquated control tower equipment, long hours on the job and the inability to hire career switchers past the age of 31. 
Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, representing nearly 20,000 professionals, spoke to federal lawmakers about the persistent controller staffing challenges earlier this month at a U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee hearing.
​​https://michiganadvance.com/2025/03/27/repub/after-deadly-midair-collision-lawmakers-grill-faa-army-on-shocking-lack-of-safety-system/
“A properly-staffed controller workforce is necessary in order to safely and efficiently meet all of its operational, statutory, and contractual requirements, while also having the personnel resources to research, develop, deploy, and then train the existing workforce on new procedures, technology, and modernization initiatives,” said Daniels on March 4 to lawmakers. 
He added that without a sustainable hiring, training, and staffing model, which is outlined in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, “the FAA will struggle to maintain the current capacity of the system, let alone modernize or expand it for new users.”
Attention on air traffic controllers increased after an FAA investigation into the Jan. 29 mid-air collision of a commercial jet and Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people. The agency’s probe found that only one controller was on duty, which “was not normal,” with one person doing the work normally assigned to two people at the time of the collision, the Associated Press reported. 
 How the recruitment and hiring process has improved

One of the ways the department is incentivizing interest in the open positions is by increasing starting salaries by 30% for candidates who go to the FAA Academy. The average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year.
Duffy said that the department would prioritize candidates who received the highest Air Traffic Skills Assessment Test scores for the FAA Academy and accelerate the time-to-hire for critical positions by cutting more than four months off the old process.
The FAA said once trainees successfully pass through the academy, they’ll be assigned to a tower or other facility across the country, where they’ll work toward their certification with experienced air traffic controllers.
“This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it,” Duffy said on Feb. 27. “The new streamlined hiring process is just the first step to deliver on President Trump’s agenda to prioritize the American people’s safety and modernize the federal government.”

It’s not surprising that Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in our current partisan landscape, failed to protest the damage inflicted on Virginians by President Donald Trump’s reckless cuts to the federal workforce. Rarely do politicians publicly criticize the president when they’re from the same party.
Youngkin tweaks state budget with eye on federal cuts, but embraces key spending

That’s why Youngkin focused on the nation’s monetary struggles rather than the indiscriminate, rapacious actions of Trump and his designated henchman Elon Musk, who runs the DOGE apparatus.
“Today, we know we have a federal government that is facing huge fiscal issues with $37 trillion in debt, with $2 trillion being added every year,” Youngkin said earlier this month. “What that requires is real action quickly.”
Youngkin didn’t mention how the tax cuts that Trump rammed through in 2017 exacerbated the situation. After all, the national debt rose almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s first term. Nor did he acknowledge that Virginians are losing job security even though they’ve done nothing wrong. He also left out the lawsuits and recalls to work of thousands of employees that have followed some of the initial layoffs, and the protesters that have rallied against the callousness emanating from Washington.
Instead, the guv noted more than a quarter-million jobs are available through a state portal. He suggested many people who are laid off can still land on their feet.
Youngkin deserves opprobrium for suggesting Virginia can absorb a huge portion of those federal jobs – especially since many won’t be at comparable salaries. More than 341,000 federal workers lived in the commonwealth in 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau reported. The potential economic hardships that residents here face are too real, too devastating to Virginians’ livelihoods.
“The indifference to the suffering of Virginians – who’ve done absolutely nothing wrong and were, in fact, extremely valuable to their agencies – is really problematic,” Jacqueline Simon, policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, told The Washington Post.
Besides, the correlation between the skills among Virginia’s federal employees and the state’s available jobs “at best was 30%,”  Terry L. Clower, director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis and a professor who studied the issue, said in an interview.
Governors to laid-off federal workers: We’ll hire you

The Washington Post reported, just days after Youngkin’s comments, that many offerings the state has listed come with large pay cuts compared to federal jobs.
Clower noted the ongoing uncertainty for laid-off federal workers has complicated their lives. Should they try to relocate? If recalled to the federal government, should they go back to their jobs – knowing their return to civil service could be reversed, yet again?
An ancillary factor: “A lot of the (federal) contractors are starting to pull back on their hiring, even if their contracts haven’t been touched,” Clower said.
A Youngkin spokesman told me Thursday by email that the state has identified 259,000 jobs open in the public and private sectors, and roughly 120,000 of them require a bachelor’s degree or higher.
“We are committed to ensuring that these opportunities are accessible to people with a wide range of experience and backgrounds,” said Peter A. Finocchio. “ … Whether someone wants to continue in their current field or explore something new, Virginia is ready to support them with the tools, training, and guidance they need to thrive.”
The problem begins when someone’s skills don’t match up with available jobs in Virginia. There’s also the issue of whether the employment opportunity is nearby or clear across the state.
For example, would someone living in the state’s “Urban Crescent” (the major localities from Northern Virginia down through Richmond and jutting southeast to Hampton Roads) move elsewhere – and vice versa? Cultural and urban-rural differences could be factors.
Families with school-age children probably would think twice about selling their home, changing school divisions and jettisoning established relationships in their communities – especially if pay and benefits are significantly lower under a new employer.
If laid-off federal workers from the commonwealth don’t like the job market here, “They’re likely to leave Virginia and go somewhere else. That’s a bad thing,” said Vinod Agarwal, deputy director of Old Dominion University’s Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy.
Such individuals would take their skills – and tax dollars – to another state. “That’s not good for Virginia’s economy,” Agarwal told me.
Last week, Axios.com reported that the Virginia Department of Health is facing layoffs after the Trump administration announced it’s cutting $11.4 billion in COVID-related funding. Axios said it was unclear how many VDH employees would lose their jobs. So federal cuts are having a ripple effect. 
On  Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would cut 20,000 positions, half through layoffs. Based in Washington, HHS said it would save $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees.
These announcements never seem to acknowledge how services to Americans will inevitably decline because there will be fewer employees to handle the various duties.
Military veterans are especially at risk from the layoffs. They constitute around 30% of the federal workforce. Virginia is home to the third-highest share of veterans nationwide, based on percentage.
It’s bad enough that Trump’s administration continues to announce cuts. What makes it worse is the lack of transparency about the decision-making process used by DOGE, or why jobs in specific agencies are now deemed extraneous.
Which brings me back to Youngkin. It’s fine he’s taken steps to assist Virginians affected by the chaos in Washington over federal layoffs. His rosy pronouncements, however, can’t make up for lower pay and benefits and questionable job security.
He should convey that reality to the president.

(Getty images)If you live in Rhode Island, you can help safeguard our democracy by supporting the Freedom to Read Act. It is  sponsored in the Senate with a bill by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat. The House version is sponsored by Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat. If enacted, this legislation would protect against censorship in public and school libraries, and it would protect librarians. And it would make Rhode Island only the fifth state to protect the basic freedom to read (Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey are the other four).
The Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education has recommended that the proposed Freedom to Read Act be held for further study after conducting a State House hearing on March 12. But that is standard practice and doesn’t mean the end of the road for this important bill. 
Here’s why Rhode Islanders who care about democracy should support it.
Many Americans fear that the institutions protecting our democracy are under threat. Democracy originated in the city-states of ancient Greece, where citizens met in open forums to voice their opinions and share ideas. Ever since, the free flow of ideas has been essential to the preservation of democracy. Thus it’s now more important than ever to protect our access to all sources of ideas, including books.
The First Amendment protects our basic freedoms, including freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protects books from being banned by government officials; however, that ruling is frequently ignored. Despite the fact that the First Amendment prohibits book banning, the number of actual attempts to ban them is increasing dramatically. In the 2023-2024 school year, PEN America counted more than 10,000 book bans in public schools. 
To any reasonably open-minded adult, the whole notion of forcing one’s own beliefs on others is preposterous. Probably every book ever written offends someone, somewhere, but hopefully no one wants to ban all books. No matter how innocent a book might seem, someone is bound to be offended. Winnie the Pooh? That honey-obsessed bear clearly has an eating disorder. And talk about eating disorders, The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a field guide to compulsive overeating. Goodnight Moon? That poor kid’s rodent-infested bedroom is disgusting and unsafe. I wish I were being facetious, but I’m not — people have attacked these classic books for the reasons mentioned.










The free flow of ideas has been essential to the preservation of democracy. Thus it’s now more important than ever to protect our access to all sources of ideas, including books.


How about Charlotte’s Web? Surely, no one could object to such a sweet, heart-warming story. Wrong. It was once banned from a few children’s libraries because a group of parents objected to the book’s “blasphemous” talking animals. There’s got to be an unoffensive book somewhere. I thought I found one: Sesame Street: Ready, Set, Brush! — a pop-up book featuring familiar Sesame Street characters demonstrating proper brushing techniques. Unoffensive? Not to some devout Jainists who avoid brushing their teeth because the act could harm the microorganisms living in the mouth. Fortunately, Jainists aren’t into book banning, or it’d be adiós Elmo and his toothbrush.
I could go on ad infinitum, but there’s no need. Books contain ideas, and even though some people are going to be offended, the unrestricted discussion of ideas must continue because that is the bedrock of democracy. Authors, librarians, and book lovers don’t want to silence anyone. We want to hear what you think about our books, and if a book offends you, please speak up. Write a letter to the editor, go to PTO and school board meetings, let us know what you think. Just don’t try to ban our books. Let us decide what books we want to read and what books we want our kids to read, and we’ll extend the same respect to you.
Amazingly, only 11 people were behind 60% of attempts to ban books in 2021-2022. Obviously, these folks are committed to their obsession, and nothing anyone can say is likely to dissuade them. Our best defense is to enact legislation that prohibits book banning and protects educators and librarians from censorship-related lawsuits.

The court heard oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could allow states to challenge federal environmental rules in more favorable courts. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)U.S. Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments last week in a case that could allow states to challenge federal environmental rules in more favorable courts.
The case could determine whether certain U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations are reviewed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit — which has more liberal judges — or in regional courts, where certain states and industry groups would prefer to make their arguments.
The dispute centers around EPA’s decision that 21 states’ plans for ozone pollution failed to meet federal Clean Air Act standards. Oklahoma and Utah challenged that disapproval in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which spans six Western states. The federal agency argued the challenge should be heard in the D.C. Circuit.
The D.C. Circuit is the venue for lawsuits over rules that are national in scope, while local or regional issues are heard in regional circuit courts. The EPA argues that it used a consistent methodology for all 21 denials, making it an issue that should be resolved nationally in a single court. Oklahoma and Utah contend that regional courts are better suited to account for state-specific factors.
During oral arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to question the notion that states should bring their challenges to regional courts.
“[Air pollution] crosses the country in ways that don’t respect our jurisdictional boundaries between circuits,” he said.
Gorsuch suggested such an approach could create confusion, if states bring challenges to varying regional courts that issue conflicting rulings.
“We’re going to have different interpretations of the statute with different — different circuits and all these terrible splits and — and, gosh, we won’t have the immediate resolution of the D.C. Circuit that we could have,” he said.
Meanwhile, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that state-specific factors informed each EPA denial.
“It matters that you are Denver versus, you know, Arizona or whatever in terms of how the modeling works,” she said.

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We&#8217;ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
After a long slog, climate change lawsuits will finally put Big Oil on trial

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

There have been weekly protests outside the dealership in the Easton shopping development and in other cities since Trump took office in January. By Saturday, warm weather and rumors that the Proud Boys would come out in support of Trump and Musk swelled the ranks of those who wanted to protest the billionaires. Similar protests were held across the United States and around the world. 
Police separated demonstrators and counter-demonstrators. But both groups were peaceful, and in some instances talked seriously with each other.
  More than 1,000 turned out to protest outside a Columbus Tesla dealership. (Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)
People protesting Trump and Musk lined both sides of the street and wound around the corner. They expressed anger over many of the actions of the new administration, including its heavy-handed treatment of immigrants, its decimation of antitrust and consumer-protection watchdogs, and its perceived abandonment of Ukraine. 
But the major target of the protests was Musk and the power Trump has given him.
Musk wasn’t elected and he hasn’t been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. But as he runs the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” he’s tried to hack away at government programs, many of which benefit the poor and average Americans.
For example, Musk is trying to fire 80,000 people from the Department of Veterans Affairs, he axed a program that pays farmers for produce for food pantries, and he’s trying to lay off tens of thousands at such agencies as the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education. As he has, Musk’s unofficial agency has committed a series of blunders that have left many to question his competence. Even so, Musk has become even richer under the new administration.
Protesters held signs with a picture of Musk doing a now-infamous gesture mirroring a Nazi salute in January. Some noted that Musk’s own companies get millions a day in government subsidies as he targets what he sees as waste in other programs.

“We don’t want no swasticars,” went one chant that took jabs at Musk’s electric car and rocket companies. “Take a one-way trip to Mars.”
Peggy Kissel of Westerville said she was protesting because she felt like she needed to do something.
“I don’t feel like we have a say in what’s happening because Congress and the courts haven’t been able to stand up to the things that are happening,” she said as cars drove past, honking in support.
A man who helped organize the counter-protest declined to identify himself except to call himself “Patriot Dad.” He said he came out to defend the Tesla dealership after acts of vandalism and the discovery of incendiary devices in other cities.

“There actually are Americans who care about protecting an American company and American workers,” he said. “I thought maybe we should create a shield or create a wall around a building that is clearly a target for domestic terrorism right now.”
Asked about the cuts Musk and Trump are making, the man said, “Most of us who voted for Donald Trump knew what Elon Musk was going to be doing when he got in there. Quite honestly Trump has all the authority he needs to go in and create efficiencies and that’s what Elon Musk is doing.” 
Many of those who were protesting the new administration were adamant that Trump is abusing his power.
Miriam Scudder said she’s traveled to several foreign countries, including in Africa. She said she’s worried that Americans don’t appreciate the rights Trump and Musk are trying to erode.
“We have a certain privilege here in the United States that I don’t see in other countries,” she said. “I don’t think we really appreciate how much we have here and I feel like we’re throwing it away. I feel like we’re the spoiled child throwing a temper tantrum because of something we can’t agree on. No. 1 is immigration because hate and fear are powerful things.”

It’s been two decades since state legislators bowed to tourism industry lobbyists and passed a law forbidding local school districts from starting the traditional calendar school year prior to the last week of August.
It was a familiar case of industry campaign cash trumping recommendations of education experts and the wellbeing of children.
In the years since, local school districts — anxious to take advantage of completing their first semester prior to the Christmas break — have repeatedly tried to buck the rule and often gotten into hot water for doing so.
Now, thankfully, it looks like legislative leaders may be backtracking a bit. Under a Senate bill introduced last week, the permissible start date would be set a week earlier — the Monday closest to August 19 — and it’s a welcome proposal.
The bottom line: The bill isn’t perfect as local districts would prefer more flexibility and tourism special interests are still being given way too much say-so in the matter, but in a legislature that so often ignores the best interests of kids, it’s better than nothing.

While women make up 50.1% of the state’s population, per the latest census, they make up only 35.8% of the legislative chambers combined, according to data from Rutgers University’s Center for American Women in Politics. Historically and today, the largest gender gaps are in the 400-person House. Women are also typically underrepresented in the 24-person Senate, but they have reached gender parity briefly this century and, for two years, outnumbered men in the chamber by one seat.
Women lawmakers across the political spectrum offered a variety of opinions on why women remain underrepresented in the Legislature — and whether that underrepresentation has policy consequences for the state. While New Hampshire’s citizen Legislature is a point of pride for many, some said the $100-a-year pay had a disproportionate impact on women, who studies show still bear the brunt of child care and domestic duties. Women who were raising children while in office said strong support systems were essential for allowing them to do their work as elected officials.
Researchers said women see better representation in legislatures that are more professionalized, meaning elected office is a full-time job with better pay and resources like strong staff support and an office. They also pointed to other factors affecting women’s participation, like party recruitment efforts.
Some lawmakers described the personal impact of being a woman in a space dominated by men. They felt they had to work harder than their male colleagues to be taken seriously, and faced gendered stereotyping or assumptions. Meanwhile, others felt their gender posed no or little challenge to their political life.
New Hampshire is in the middle of the pack among states when it comes to women’s representation in legislatures. Nevada is the only legislature where women outnumber men, making up 60.3% of the chambers. In Arizona, women and men have equal representation, and in the other 48 states, there are more men than women. In Congress, 28% of lawmakers are women.
The share of women in the Legislature, with some spikes, has remained relatively stagnant over the decades.
“One of the things that those of us who study this like to say is that, you know, there’s nothing inevitable about women’s representation. It’s not as though time itself changes anything,” said Anna Mahoney, the executive director of Dartmouth College’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences. “What changes women’s participation in government is action, either on behalf of political parties, or grassroots organizations, (or) women candidates themselves.”

In the chambers, on the trail
There’s a question Becky Whitley heard more than any other in her brief run for the state’s 2nd Congressional District last year — a question she wonders if a male candidate would hear.
“The number one question that I was asked, even by my own family members, was, you know: ‘What about your son?’” Whitley said. “And so I just question whether — and I don’t know, I can’t speak from experience — do men get the same questions, right?”

Whitley represented the capital area as a Democrat in the state Senate from 2020 to 2024. In her political experience, she felt women faced different pressures and expectations than men. That was felt across the aisle, too.
Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican and a deputy majority leader in the Senate, said she’s used to challenging those expectations.
“If you’ve seen me, I have big hair, and I wear high heels. I think that people underestimate me because I don’t want to change my style to be taken more seriously, right?” Ricciardi said. “So you have to work harder. … I have to prove myself, but I don’t mind. In fact, it feels like a victory when you do prove yourself, and people see the real you.”
Ricciardi isn’t a fan of party politics; she said she’s motivated instead by “doing what’s right for people.” She said she feels women in a male-dominated space “have to work harder to be taken more seriously.”
While she said she hasn’t really experienced this perception from voters, “I definitely think with colleagues, I think there’s just this thought that … we’re not as smart or we can’t do it … the way they want to do it,” she said.
Whitley said “women have a very fine line to walk.”
“I felt this acutely in terms of … our standards for behavior, in terms of how strong we can be, in terms of our decorum, in terms of what we look like, what we can say,” Whitley said. “I felt very acutely that the line for what was appropriate for women in, you know, the public sphere was … quite different than it is for men. And so … I have always felt like, you know, I have to work a little bit harder. I have to be a little bit clearer. I have to … really walk that line. And I certainly think that men in my same position don’t feel that way.”

Other women lawmakers felt differently. Asked whether there are still obstacles for women in politics today, Sen. Regina Birdsell, a Hampstead Republican who serves as majority leader, said, “When I first got in, I say yes, but things are really starting to open up.” She said she has often observed women beat out men in legislative races, and that she has seen more younger women getting involved than when she first ran in 2010.
“If a woman is really interested in running, and they do it right, I think they have a much better chance of prevailing,” Birdsell said. “So I think … if you know how to do it, and you do it right, I think the door is wide open for you.”
Rep. Judy Aron, a South Acworth Republican who chairs the House Environment and Agriculture Committee, said she felt “we’re way past that” in terms of women facing obstacles in politics.

“I don’t know that there’s any particular right number of percentage. I mean, why should it be 50/50?” Aron said. “I think it’s a matter of … who our voters think are qualified to do these jobs, or be in these elected positions.”
But others felt fewer women in the Legislature meant less attention on issues that impact women. Mahoney, the Dartmouth researcher, said “a lot of the research shows that when you have more women in your legislature, the topics that you’re talking about and the legislative agenda itself shifts.”
Ricciardi pointed to the “Momnibus” bills, legislation aimed at maternal health spearheaded by women. Male colleagues aren’t as focused “on maternal issues, child care issues, family issues as much, and those are really important things that we need in our state,” she said.
Women have unique lived experiences to bring to the table, said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who was the first woman in American history to be elected both as a governor and a U.S. senator. 
“You know, I used to say this a lot when I became the first woman to be elected as New Hampshire’s governor: women make up half of our population, and we have different life experiences than men do,” Shaheen said in a statement to the Bulletin. “Not better or worse — but different, and it’s important to have those experiences and views represented, regardless of which side of the aisle those women fall on.” 
Women shape elected bodies beyond just legislation, Mahoney said. Their presence in legislatures can affect everything from the architecture of the buildings where they work — adding women’s restrooms by the chambers’ floors where they weren’t before or rooms for nursing — to the culture of the chambers.
“When we look to see what kind of impact women have once they’re in the institution,” she said, “one of the things that I like to look at is not just necessarily the bills that they are supporting or that they’re voting for, but how they’re changing the institution itself.”

Challenges and solutions
The challenges facing women are multipronged, and so are the solutions to getting more in office, researchers said.
“We need societal and cultural change,” Mahoney said, “but we also need the nuts and bolts of party infrastructure and legitimate support in order to increase the number of women running for office.”
Those recruitment efforts may be difficult for candidates of any gender at a time “when government is not necessarily seen as a place where good things can get done efficiently,” and trust in American institutions is low, she said.
In terms of challenges on the campaign trail, research into voters’ perceptions of women candidates is “sort of mixed,” Mahoney said. 
In the general election, “you don’t see as much bias, because people are really relying on party cues, and so they’re going to vote for their party regardless of who the candidate is,” she said. “It’s really in those primary contests where women face specific challenges of fundraising, whether they are perceived to be really legitimate candidates that can win, and those sorts of things.”
Women candidates can benefit in elections where topics considered “women’s issues” — like reproductive rights — are important, Mahoney said. 
The set-up of a legislature can pose its own challenges. Emily Baer, an assistant professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, pointed to the fact that in more professionalized legislatures, with better pay and more staff support, “women tend to be better represented.”
The “flip side” of having a citizen Legislature in New Hampshire, she said, “is it’s much harder  for women to serve in a state that is not providing them with the resources to pursue that as a career, while also balancing other things in their personal and professional lives.”
This may have an acute effect on women in particular because of factors like being underrepresented in professions that are considered political pipelines, as well as access to child care and other resources, she said.
“A lot of studies still show that women, even when they are working full-time professional careers, still do a lot more at home in terms of household responsibilities and child care responsibilities,” Baer said, “and serving in the state Legislature — particularly if it’s not something that can be a career for them, and they’re balancing it alongside their own professional career and then higher levels of responsibility at home — that’s something that affects women politicians much more than it would affect male politicians.”
Additionally, the citizen Legislature has a “bias towards older, retired individuals,” Baer said, “because they might have more time and slightly better financial position to allow them to serve in those legislatures. And so when we talk about parity in women’s representation, you want parity that actually reflects the diversity of that group as well.”
Research has found that women often wait to run for office until their children have gone to school or left home, which “frequently delays women’s entrance into politics,” Mahoney said. For many, family support is key.
Whitley, the former capital-area state senator, said her supportive spouse and community, as well as her mother nearby, made her public service possible.
“But not everyone has that, and so if one of those things weren’t true, I wouldn’t have been able to serve,” Whitley said. And, even then, serving longer than the four years she was in office “just wasn’t sustainable for my family,” she said.
  Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka (Senate Staff)
Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader and a Portsmouth Democrat, said her legislative work “requires a lot of supportive people in my life, and also a really good mastery of Google calendar.” 
She’s found it helpful to talk with other moms doing similar work, and she hopes to return the help, even if it’s just talking about the actual logistics of the job, like juggling legislative demands with getting the kids to school. 
“Just being able to kind of demystify that, I think, for people makes it a little more accessible,” she said.
Birdsell, the Senate majority leader, said a program she was in aimed at getting Republican women in the state to run for office helped her greatly. They learned about media, the basics of the Legislature, went to Washington, D.C., and met stakeholders involved in the political process. That program is now defunct, but she said she would love to see its return.
And while state legislatures can be stepping stones to higher office, a number of women who propelled themselves to the highest political planes in New Hampshire — Congress and the governorship — did so without first serving in the State House, Baer noted, suggesting other avenues for women candidates.
Perkins Kwoka thinks women serving can act as a positive feedback loop.
“The more women we have serving, the more women, I think, will be able to see themselves in the role,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8020-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-03-31 05:03:04.198915

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal judge dismissed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to shutter the Dakota Access Pipeline, finding that the tribe must wait until the Army Corps finishes a key environmental study to bring another legal challenge against the agency.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a Friday order.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, arguing that Corps is violating federal law by allowing the pipeline to operate without an easement. The tribe also claimed that the Corps failed to properly study the environmental impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline or require its developer to prepare adequate spill response plans, among other alleged violations.
The suit is a successor to a lawsuit the tribe filed against the same agency in 2016.

More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage

In that case, Boasberg in 2020 found the Army Corps had violated federal law by not conducting a full environmental impact study before granting an easement allowing the pipeline to cross underneath the Missouri River. He pulled the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be drained of oil pending the Army Corps’ completion of the study.
An appellate court in 2021 reversed Boasberg’s decision to shut down the pipeline, but did not reinstate the easement.
Boasberg wrote in a 2021 order following that decision that he could not shutter the pipeline because the tribe hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that it posed an immediate threat of irreparable harm.
He noted in his Friday memo that “remarkably little” has changed in the four years since.
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends,” Boasberg wrote at the beginning of the order, quoting Shakespeare’s “Henry V”.
The Army Corps still has not finished the environmental impact study. It published a draft version of its report in late 2023. Once the study is complete, the Army Corps will use it to decide whether to grant the easement again.
One of the main arguments the tribe made in its 2024 lawsuit is that the Army Corps’ yearslong inaction on the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of federal law.
Boasberg wrote previously that, given the pipeline is operating on Army Corps land without proper authorization, the agency in the interim could have done something to enforce its property rights.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in his 2021 order.
But the Army Corps for now is not legally required to do anything but finish the environmental impact study, Boasberg stated in the Friday memo.
He said that other arguments Standing Rock raised in its complaint seek to relitigate issues that were already decided in the 2016 case, and that the legal landscape is not likely to change until the study is completed.
Boasberg noted that Standing Rock can file another lawsuit against the Corps once the study is published. The Army Corps of Engineers in legal filings also argued the tribe cannot sue the Corps over the easement when it had not yet made a final decision on the permit.
The tribe indicated last fall that it had new evidence to present related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
North Dakota, other states and pipeline owner Dakota Access intervened in the lawsuit on the side of the Corps. The intervenors called on the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the pipeline is important to the country’s economy, and that shutting it down would violate states’ rights and make road and rail transit less safe.
“The Dakota Access Pipeline has been operating safely for almost eight years now and is a critical piece of infrastructure for North Dakota and our nation’s energy security,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement regarding Boasberg’s decision.
A spokesperson for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment.
“The Corps has failed to act and failed to protect the tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in an October press conference announcing the lawsuit.
The pipeline, which spans more than 1,000 miles, carries crude oil from northwest North Dakota to Illinois. Its pathway includes unceded land recognized as the Sioux Nation’s in 19th century treaties signed by the U.S. government.

Democrats pushed through this plan without Republican support after Senate Republicans refused to support a change package for the current fiscal year to address the immediate MaineCare funding deficit unless it included structural reform to the program.
The majority party argues a stopgap two-year budget was needed to “keep the lights on” and provide consistency to Mainers amid federal uncertainty, but that it was only “part one.” The budget leaves some things unfunded, notably another expected shortfall for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. Democrats say that was an intentional decision to wait for updated state revenue projections and any changes coming from Washington D.C. 
Republicans argue, because of that, the budget isn’t balanced and also doesn’t include any of the policy changes Democrats may be looking to adopt in a “part two” budget — a framework they disavow as disingenuous. 
Some from the minority party have started collecting signatures for a People’s Veto of the budget that passed, which, if they secure at least 67,682 signatures from Maine voters by June 18, would put the law on hold until the November election or an earlier statewide special election — causing a government shutdown. 
“It’s reckless. It’s chaotic. It’s what we’re seeing in Washington, D.C., brought here to Maine,” Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau (D-Bidderford) said of the People’s Veto.
Political jabs aside, how are legislators honestly thinking about re-evaluating spending in light of the projected $450 million deficit over the next two years?
That budget bill was “not the last word,” Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) said.
“We need to start having the conversations about what the 132nd Maine Legislature wants,” Daughtry said. 
‘March majority madness’: Legislative Democrats pass two-year budget over Republican objections

Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said his primary concern for the remainder of session is MaineCare. 
“It’s not fixed,” Stewart said. “We are highly likely to be right back in here within a year dealing with yet another Medicaid bailout, to say nothing of what happens on the federal front.”
First, how much money is left? 
Republicans argue there is no money left for more work this session. Democrats argue that’s not true. There’s validity to both claims, depending on how you view the situation. 
The state is expected to bring in $11,224,416,665 in revenue over the next biennium, fiscal years 2026 and 2027, based on the latest forecast from December. 
While the general fund appropriations in the budget that passed last week total $11,320,717,493 for that timeframe, the total net impact is actually a bit less, $11,229,531,053.
Factoring in these new appropriations, remaining balances carried over and transfers, Christopher Nolan, director of the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal and Program Review, said fiscal year 2027 is expected to end with $127,737,632. 
This is what’s left for lawmakers to still appropriate in a “part two” budget or through individual bill spending.
However, funding the expected Medicaid gap in 2027 would absorb most of it. The tax increases and program cuts Gov. Janet Mills proposed will be considered in the next budget, which could free up more dollars for new initiatives. 
Uncertainty on the federal level adds another layer of complications to the funding landscape. On the state-level, the latest fiscal briefing from the Office of Fiscal and Program Review released last week shows general fund revenue is currently $28 million below budget. Much could change before the updated revenue forecast in May. 
There’s also another strategy lawmakers have expressed interest in exploring that could alter how much money they have to work with: resetting baseline spending, which the recently passed budget continued as is. 
Regardless, there is apprehension about fiscal possibilities, as underscored by Rep. Amanda Collamore (R-Pittsfield) on the House floor last week. 
“What is the point of working any bill with a fiscal note that isn’t negative?” Collamore asked. “I’m not sure it’s responsible to vote for any bill, including my own.” 
The process will, and should still play out, Stewart said. 
“We don’t know what we don’t know until we get there,” he said.
In any session, regardless of the economic landscape, the budget process is murky with many bills dying by way of the “appropriations table,” which all legislation with a fiscal note ends up on even after passing the House and Senate. 
Last session, less than 10% of bills on the table became law. 
The final arbiters are the legislators who sit on the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, and the behind-the-scenes negotiating that determines their votes, along with the governor’s veto pen. 
Daughtry and Fecteau both said they believe what comes next shouldn’t actually be up to them. 
“I recognize as a leader I have a larger bully pulpit than the average members but I have trust in my colleagues not only on the policy committees but also on the Appropriations Committee,” Daughtry said. “I really am trying to keep my palate dry and wait and see what my colleagues are able to come up with, what our members of the public say as well.”
While acknowledging that the Legislature has a balancing act ahead of it, Fecteau agreed.
“I’m not going to sit here and say I can identify all of the ways in which we can save money from the baseline or we can save money from not moving forward new initiatives that were proposed or how we can generate revenue in the most effective way,” Fecteau said. “But what I can say is it will all be on the table and up for consideration amongst my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. That’s their charge.”

What’s possible with what’s left? 
Stewart often repeats his stance that the state has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Before the start of the session, he told Maine Morning Star he wanted the Legislature to audit the state budget to assess whether current funding levels are adequate. 
So what do lawmakers want to reassess? “It’s all the above,” Stewart said. “You’ve got to start peeling back the layers of the onion.”
Vacancies 
There’s the assumption, and historic reality, that the governor will get most of what she asks for, which includes a plan for approximately 250 more government positions. Stewart wants to see the state address vacancies first. 
As of Feb. 13, there were 1,975 vacancies out of 13,557 permanent positions, amounting to a 14.6% vacancy rate, according to the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Affairs. For comparison, the vacancy rate in February 2024 was 16.6% and in March 2023 was 16.2%.
DAFS Director of Communications Sharon Huntley said there are many reasons positions are vacant, and sometimes it’s intentional, such as with seasonal positions, which make up 10% of the current vacancies.
“It’s also important to note that eliminating a position will not necessarily save money,” Huntley said. “Of the 1,975 permanent vacancies, nearly half don’t include any general fund funding. For example, positions that are in place to use on as-needed basis funded with non-general fund dollars. While vacant they don’t cost the state or the fund anything, and, similarly, eliminating them won’t save anything.”
Additionally, each biennial budget includes savings from attrition — the assumption that there will be gradual staff reductions due to employees leaving and not being replaced. The two-year budget that passed included a 5% attrition rate level, up from 1.6%, which means the state has to have some level of vacancy in positions that are funded with general funds to achieve this budgeted savings.
Aside from a focus on vacancies, Stewart questioned, “what’s the vision?” 
Pointing to Maine students’ low test scores, inadequate mental health supports — a key point of contention in budget debates last year — and closing hospitals, which had already been struggling financially with high operating costs and low reimbursement rates before the supplemental budget scuffle, Stewart said reforming systems is what’s needed.
In Stewart’s view, that’s namely MaineCare. 
Health care
Legislative Republicans already presented proposals for reforming the program during supplemental budget negotiations, which Stewart said they’ll continue to push. These include requesting waivers from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to mandate reductions in enrollment, as well as institute work requirements for able-bodied, childless adults. 
The mandated reduction could start with a full review of everyone on the program to eliminate people who no longer qualify, Stewart said. What exactly work requirements would look like, he doesn’t know. The Trump administration may make such changes on the federal level, though he doesn’t see that as a reason to avoid doing it on the state-level first. 
Daughtry said she’s willing to discuss MaineCare reform. 
“If we’re having provider fraud or someone taking advantage of the system, I’m willing to hear those ideas,” Daughtry said, “but when you’re penalizing people whose very lives depend on the health care, that’s not promoting the economy. That’s going after people in need.” 
Approximately 30% of Mainers and roughly half of all Maine children are covered by MaineCare. “I really do feel healthcare is a human right,” Daughtry said. She also said it’s the will of the people, who have twice approved expansions to MaineCare at the ballot box. 










If we’re having provider fraud or someone taking advantage of the system, I’m willing to hear those ideas, but when you’re penalizing people whose very lives depend on the health care, that’s not promoting the economy. That’s going after people in need.


– Senate President Mattie Daughtry


Fecteau said he’d entertain the reforms left on the table by Senate Republicans rejecting the supplemental deal, specifically restrictions to ensure that people who win the lottery or who are incarcerated don’t remain eligible for MaineCare.
While Fecteau said the two-year budget could have fully funded MaineCare through 2027, the decision not to was an effort to say “let’s have an open and earnest conversation around potential reforms.”
Senate Minority Leader Matthew Harrington (R-York) explained in a press conference last week that the minority party’s ultimate goal is to shift people currently on MaineCare to federal exchanges.
Maine is one of 19 states, and Washington D.C., that fully run their own health insurance marketplace, called CoverME.gov. 
Last month, nearly 65,000 Mainers signed up for affordable health coverage through CoverME.gov for 2025, according to Health and Human Services Commissioner Sara Gagné-Holmes. However, Maine’s Office of Health Insurance Marketplace is the smallest in the nation and the office is requesting more positions in this next budget to keep up with growing enrollment. 
For people who are working, Harrington argued, “These folks can afford to pay something for health insurance. We should be encouraging them to do so.”
Daughtry said such a claim misunderstands how the marketplace works, as people are not able to enroll if their income threshold is below the bar that qualifies them for MaineCare.
“It’s ensuring that folks are able to find a product that meets with their income guidelines,” Daughtry said. “Now, if we could actually have the real conversation behind driving more people to the marketplace, it’s making sure people have more money in their pockets.” 
Daughtry hopes the Legislature considers bills that seek to establish a living wage, particularly addressing underpay in the public sector, as well as proposals to help families, such as better supporting childcare.  
Harrington and Stewart also argued that high MaineCare enrollment hurts hospitals, as they only receive a 70% reimbursement through the program compared to higher private-payer reimbursements. 
Daughtry argued the state should increase MaineCare reimbursements. However, she added that private insurance is also not reimbursing people enough. 
“It’s not just MaineCare,” Daughtry said. “The health care system as a whole is broken.” 
Taxes and cuts
Given the $450 million deficit the state is facing over the next biennium, and that only $127 million remains for the second year, program cuts and taxes are being considered, including the slate of changes Mills proposed that were not included in the “part one” budget.
Progressives are not supportive of her plan to cut some programs, including childcare workers stipends, and Republicans have already drawn a line in the sand regarding tax increases of any kind. 
While Mills has suggested a number of largely regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on low earners, some Democratic legislators are alternatively pushing for a model that taxes the wealthy more, including a “millionaire tax,” similar to a law recently passed in Massachusetts to tax income over $1 million by an additional 4%. 
One of Fecteau’s proposals, LD 1082, is to increase the real estate transfer tax on home sales above $1 million to increase the resources the state commits to the construction of affordable housing. Other lawmakers have proposed taxes on short-term rentals or changing the timeframe for accessing Historic Property Rehabilitation Tax Credits to fund things like affordable housing and education without adding to state spending. 
Albeit in different ways, there’s consensus that systems need to change. 
Stewart said of Democrats, “They want to be all things to all people all the time,” intentionally or not, calling back to the phrase Mills repeated when she first introduced her budget plan in January. 
“I don’t think government can, or should, be all things to all people at all times,” Mills said in defense of her proposed cuts and tax increases.
Ultimately, as Fecteau put it, “It’s going to be a balancing act.”

Encino Energy was chosen to lease 62 acres of land in Leesville, which is property of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Friday’s meeting lasted about 15 minutes. 
The commissioners posted the nominated leasing parcel for bid on Jan. 2, and the deadline to submit bids was Feb. 1. Each lease agreement includes a 12.5% royalty paid to the state for production, per state law, with an additional financial incentive paid by the winning bidder to the state, according to ODNR.

The lease bonuses for these nominations chosen by the committee is $218,715 for ODNR properties, according to ODNR.
Fracking is the process of injecting liquid into the ground at a high pressure to extract oil or gas. Anti-fracking advocates from Save Ohio Parks shouted questions and concerns while the commissioners conducted their meeting. 
Two nominations were considered and approved to go to bidding for fracking by the commission on Friday — 171 acres of Leesville and a possible right-of-way along SR 149 owned by the Ohio Department of Transportation in Belmont County. These nominations will go out to bid in April. 
Two nominations were up for a vote during Friday’s meeting that were not voted on — 3.6 acres in Valley Run Wildlife Area in Carroll County and a possible right-of-way along SR 151 owned by ODOT in Harrison County. 
“I propose we bring it up only for discussion today,” OGLMC Chair Theresa White said. Even though the commissioners approved the motion, there was no discussion on either piece of land. OGLMC plans to take action on these nominations at a future meeting. 
Melinda Zemper with Save Ohio Parks said Ohio needs a moratorium on natural gas fracking under state parks and public lands. 
“Gov. Mike DeWine and state legislators risk good health, our pristine lands, our water and air and livable planet by continuing to support this dangerous and polluting 20th century energy industry in our quickly warming 21st century,” she said. 
Before the meeting, Roxanne Groff also with Save Ohio Parks talked about the Jan. 2 well pad explosion in Guernsey County. The well pad is operated by Gulfport Energy and no one was injured. The Guernsey County Emergency Management Agency issued an evacuation notice within half a mile of the well pad. 
“Salt Fork State Park is going to be completely surrounded by frack well pads, and any one of those pads can have an explosion,” Groff said. “What are you going to do when there are 2,000 people in that park and there’s a well padded explosion?”
There were more than 1,400 fracking incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio between 2018 and September 2023, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. About 10% of those incidents were reported as fires or explosions.
“Our parks, our children, our grandchildren’s lives are at stake here, and you’re about to just say that doesn’t matter,” Groff said. 
Andrew Goode and Anthony Jesko are two new members of OGLMC. Both men were appointed to the commission by DeWine on Dec. 19, 2024.  Jesko is an attorney from Northeast Ohio and his term will expire Sept. 29, 2028, and Goode is an attorney from central Ohio and his term expires on Sept. 29, 2029. 
“I’ve listened intently to what you guys have said, and I will continue to listen to that, just so you guys are aware,” Goode said, referring to the comments Groff made before the meeting.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel continues to punt the question of whether he is running for governor as some Republican leaders start to make their endorsements. Other GOP politicians are holding back.
The 2026 gubernatorial race is heating up. Right now, there are three candidates seeking the GOP nomination: entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Attorney General Dave Yost and businesswoman Heather Hill.
Already, endorsements are coming out.
Hill hasn’t received any, from research into statewide or local groups and politicians.
Yost has a coalition of about 30 county sheriffs and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell.
Ramaswamy has received support from President Donald Trump, U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno, U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson of the Eighth District, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, Treasurer Robert Sprague, a coalition of about 20 sheriffs, religious lobbyist Aaron Baer and dozens of state lawmakers like Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon.
“He has the vision, business expertise, and relentless drive to make Ohio the best state in America to live, work, and raise a family,” McColley said in a statement.
But two of the most powerful Statehouse Republicans haven’t spoken up yet, including Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who appointed Tressel as lieutenant governor after appointing previous Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to the U.S. Senate.
“Well, the last I looked, we’re about 14 months away from the primary, let alone from the general election,” DeWine responded when asked about his endorsement and whether he is waiting for Tressel to get in the race. “So it’s a long, long way to go, and I’m sure there’ll be other people who get in the race.”
The governor hasn’t issued his endorsement yet, with many GOP strategists like Bob Clegg believing that he possibly chose his lieutenant governor — former OSU coach Jim Tressel — as his future replacement.
“He also picked somebody who has about 95% name ID in the state of Ohio, which is very rare,” Clegg said. “And Jim Tressel cannot have a better image here in the state of Ohio.”
Name identification refers to the number of voters who know you off the top of their heads already.
Although he hasn’t announced, Tressel has been out and about — headlining Republican events and fundraisers across the state. We asked him this week about when he will enter the race.
“When I was coaching, I would tell you I’m not thinking about the next game,” the former coach responded. “I’m thinking about this game. That hasn’t changed.”
The LG recently created a 2024 transition fund, which allows him to collect money for inaugural events. However, he filed the account after his inauguration. We asked his team why this was. Still, it would be illegal for him to use any of that money for campaign-related activities.
Tressel added that he has been busy learning about energy policy, foster care, education and workforce development.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, also hasn’t made his decision.
“The most important thing that I’m doing right now is getting the House of Representatives to come together cohesively on passing a budget,” the speaker said.
The state operating budget has monopolized this General Assembly so far, as it typically does in odd years.
“I don’t need some reason for people not to like somebody else across the aisle and not just across the Republican-Democrat aisle but across these aisles,” he said, gesturing to the GOP side of the chamber. “I don’t want to try to divide this caucus, so I’ve told all these folks if I’m going to endorse that’s not until after June 30th. Obviously, members of the House can do whatever they want.”
The Ohio Republican Party also hasn’t endorsed yet, but as DeWine said, there are more than 400 days until the primary.
“We have a long way to go,” the governor said.
Whoever wins that primary will face off against the Democratic nominee, likely former Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)No one asked for hippos to overrun Colombian rivers.
But hippos frolic in the South American country anyway, thanks to the extravagant ego of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. He imported four of the beasts for a private menagerie. After his death, they escaped and multiplied, turning into an invasive species bedeviling officials. The government has sought to sterilize and deport the beasts, but cocaine hippos keep on thriving.
And so it is with bad ideas in the Kansas Legislature. Each year lawmakers wade through scads of proposals introduced by out-of-state think tanks or touted by conservative influencers, none of them with the slightest connection to actual Kansans’ problems or concerns.
Such ideas are the cocaine hippos of Kansas politics, taking up residence in the credulous heads of GOP lawmakers and driving out all hope of sensible policymaking.
Once you spot these cocaine hippos (I must give credit to classical music critic David Hurwitz for introducing me to the term), you can’t ignore them. Their bulky yet slippery bodies have twisted and distorted the state’s political landscape. Eradicating the creatures, in whatever ways possible, will only strengthen government.
Here are five hippos spotted in the past few months.
“The Legislature adopted a spending plan Thursday that fully funds public schools, provides pay raises for state employees, eliminates DEI initiatives, polices pronouns in emails, and puts the state on a course to blow through billions in reserves and face a budget shortfall within three years.” (March 27)
You might support or oppose diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives or people sharing their pronouns in email messages. But what do they have to do with any problems in Kansas? Who has been actually, provably harmed by any of this? Kansans have been swept along by a nationwide panic over innocuous attempts to create a more caring and accepting society.
House Republicans refused to consider a plea from Democratic Rep. Valdenia Winn to send a message that there is no place for racism in the state of Kansas.
Winn, a Kansas City Democrat, proposed an amendment to House Bill 2299, which declares that antisemitism is against the public policy of the state. She wanted to expand the language to condemn all forms of racism and discrimination. (March 26)
Racism and antisemitism are both bad. Very bad. Yet why were legislators taking up or debating this bill in the first place? Discrimination on the basis of both is already illegal. Hate crimes are illegal, too. Have we seen any recent examples of such or related public unrest in Kansas? (And no, muted protests against Israel in its war against Hamas don’t count.)
The House and Senate on Tuesday overrode Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of legislation that could result in thousands of advance ballots being disqualified. (March 25)
You know who has administered elections in Kansas for years? Republicans. You know who has repeatedly reassured Kansans that our elections are safe and secure? Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab. There is no evidence that allowing three days for mail-in ballots to arrive will cause any problems. But Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, has swallowed the propaganda of President Donald Trump hook, line and sinker. U.S. elections are free and fair, and there have been no issues in Kansas.
Still, the cocaine hippos overturn boats.
Kansas House Republicans have repeatedly met in closed caucus meetings this legislative session, doing state business in secret and upending longstanding tradition. (March 24)
Republicans enjoy preposterous supermajorities in the House and Senate. They have no reason to fear sunlight or transparency. Their leaders have more options and flexibility than they have enjoyed in years. And yet, they hide. They have somehow come to believe that letting people see what they do — even if it’s as simple as persuading members to vote one way or another — simply can’t be shared. But why? What harm have they suffered?
The House still approved Senate Concurrent Resolution 1602, a nonbinding statement that urges the governor to help secure the U.S. border with Mexico and work with federal authorities to enforce immigration laws. (March 20)
As has been pointed out repeatedly, and as can be seen by merely glancing at a map, Kansas doesn’t share a border with Mexico. We have to deal with Oklahoma and Missouri, which are bad enough. Immigration fearmongering has no connection with anything actually witnessed in Kansas. As a matter of fact, whole sectors of our economy would shut down without migrant labor.
And I could go on, but cocaine hippos have a way of crowding out all rational thought.
While those of us watching from afar can see the way in which these malignant ideas have infiltrated our government, they have found surprisingly receptive hosts in lawmakers. Indeed, the mental landscape of many in Topeka would appear entirely unrecognizable to many of us. They have welcomed the hippos, praised them as saintly creatures and called on them to reproduce even more freely.
As far back as 2012, literary critic Harold Bloom raised alarms about this tendency.
In a lecture about poet Walt Whitman, he told a crowd: “We are far along on a route away from democracy into the morass of plutocracy, … oligarchy and theocracy, because many millions among us live a reality completely separate from that of those in this room, for instance. The function of literary criticism at the present time cannot be the struggle with this Moby Dick of the American spirit, yet awareness of it should be part of our common ordeal of consciousness.”
Kansas and its residents confront real obstacles. We experience real needs. Schools and special education require investment. The tax system demands rebalancing, making sure those who profit the most help everyone else. Petty hatreds and discrimination deserve to rot in the ash heap of history.
Instead, we fight nonexistent problems with phantom weapons.
And those cocaine hippos keep breeding.

Nearly every modern medical treatment can be traced to research funded by the National Institutes of Health: from over-the-counter and prescription medications that treat high cholesterol and pain to protection from infectious diseases such as polio and smallpox.
The remarkable successes of the decades-old partnership between biomedical research institutions and the federal government are so intertwined with daily life that it’s easy to take them for granted.
However, the scientific work driving these medical advances and breakthroughs is in jeopardy. Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are terminating hundreds of active research grants under the current administration’s direction. The administration has also proposed a dramatic reduction in federal support of the critical infrastructure that keeps labs open and running. Numerous scientists and health professionals have noted that changes will have far-reaching, harmful outcomes for the health and well-being of the American people.
The negative consequences of defunding U.S. biomedical research can be difficult to recognize. Most breakthroughs, from the basic science discoveries that reveal the causes of diseases to the development of effective treatments and cures, can take years. Real-time progress can be hard to measure.
As biomedical researchers studying infectious diseases, viruses and immunology, we and our colleagues see this firsthand in our own work. Thousands of ongoing national and international projects dedicated to uncovering the causes of life-threatening diseases and developing new treatments to improve and save lives are supported by federal agencies such as the NIH and NSF.
Considering a few of the breakthroughs made possible through U.S. federal support can help illustrate not only the significant inroads biomedical research has made for preventing, treating and curing human maladies, but what all Americans stand to lose if the U.S. reduces its investment in these endeavors.
 A cure for cancer

The hope and dream of curing cancer unites many scientists, health professionals and affected families across the U.S. After decades of ongoing NIH-supported research, scientists have made significant progress in realizing this goal.
The National Cancer Institute of the NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research. This investment has led to advances in cancer treatment and prevention that helped reduce the overall U.S. cancer death rate by 33% from 1991 to 2021.
Basic science research on what causes cancer has led to new strategies to harness a patient’s own immune system to eliminate tumors. For example, all 12 patients in a 2022 clinical trial testing one type of immunotherapy had their rectal cancer completely disappear, without remission or adverse effects.

Another example of progress is the 2024 results of an ongoing clinical trial of a targeted therapy for lung cancer, showing an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Similarly, in a study of women who were immunized against the human papillomavirus at age 12 or 13, none developed the disease later. Since the widespread adoption of HPV vaccination, cervical cancer deaths have dropped 62%.
Despite these incredible successes, there is still a long way to go. In 2024, over 2 million people in the U.S. were estimated to be newly diagnosed with cancer, and 611,720 were expected to die from the disease.
Without sustained federal support for cancer research, progress toward curing cancer and reducing its death rate will stall.
 Autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases

Nearly every family is touched in some way by autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Government-funded research has enabled major advances to combat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.
For example, approximately 1 in 5 Americans have arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes joint swelling and stiffness. A leading cause of disability and economic costs in the U.S., there is no cure for arthritis. But new drugs in development are able to significantly improve symptoms and slow or prevent disease progression.
Researchers are also gaining insight into what causes multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerves and can result in paralysis. Scientists recently found a link between multiple sclerosis and Epstein-Barr virus, a pathogen estimated to infect over 90% of adults around the world. While multiple sclerosis is currently incurable, identifying its underlying cause can provide new avenues for prevention and treatment.
Alzheimer’s disease causes irreversible nerve damage and is the leading cause of dementia. In 2024, 6.9 million Americans ages 65 and older were living with Alzheimer’s. Most treatments address cognitive and behavioral symptoms. However, two new drugs developed with NIH-supported research and clinical trials were approved in July 2023 and July 2024 to treat early-stage Alzheimer’s. Federal funding is also supporting the development of blood tests for earlier detection of the disease.
None of these breakthroughs are a cure. But they represent important steps forward on the path toward ultimately reducing or eliminating these devastating ailments. Lack of funding will slow or block further progress, leading to the continued rise of the incidence and severity of these conditions.
 Infectious diseases and the next pandemic

The world’s capacity to combat infectious disease will also be weakened by cuts to U.S. federal support of biomedical research.
Over the past 50 years, medical and public health advances have led to the eradication of smallpox globally and the elimination of polio in the U.S. HIV/AIDS, once a death sentence, is now a disease that can be managed with medication. Moreover, a new version of treatments called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, offers complete protection against HIV transmission when taken only twice per year.
Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the critical role biomedical research plays in responding to public health threats. Increased federal support of science during this time allowed the United States to emerge with new drugs, vaccine platforms with the potential to treat a variety of chronic diseases, and insights on how to effectively detect and respond to pandemic threats.
The ongoing avian influenza outbreak and its spillover into American dairy herds and poultry farms is another pandemic threat looming on the horizon. Rather than build upon infrastructure for outbreak surveillance and preparedness, grants that would allow scientists to better understand long COVID-19, vaccines and other pandemic-related research are being cut. Decreased funding of biomedical research will hamper the U.S.’s ability to respond to the next pandemic, putting everyone at risk.
 Losses from defunding biomedical research

The National Institutes of Health contributed over $100 billion to support research that ultimately led to the development of all new drugs approved from 2010 to 2016 alone. Over 90% of this funding was for basic research into understanding the causes of disease that provides the foundation for new treatments.
Under the new directive to eliminate projects that support or use terms associated with diversity, equity and inclusion, the NIH and other federal agencies have made deep cuts to biomedical research that will directly affect patient lives.
Already, nearly 41% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, and nearly 11% with Alzheimer’s. About 1 in 5 Americans will die from heart disease, and nearly 1.4 million will be rushed to an emergency room due to pneumonia from an infectious disease.
Defunding biomedical research will result in a cascade of effects. There will likely be fewer clinical trials, fewer new treatments and fewer lifesaving drugs. Labs will likely shut down, jobs will be lost, and the process of discovery will stall. The U.S.’s health care system, economy and standing as the world’s leader in scientific innovation will likely decline.
Moreover, when the pipelines of scientific progress are turned off, they will not so easily be turned back on. These consequences will affect all Americans and the rest of the world for decades.
University shortfalls directly resulting from cuts to research support will dramatically reduce the capacity of American institutions to educate and provide opportunities for the next generation. Funding cuts have led to the shuttering or heavy reduction of training programs for future scientists.
Graduate students and postdoctoral trainees are the lifeblood of biomedical research. Supporting these young people committed to public service through research and health care is also an investment in medical advancements and public health. But the uncertainty and instability resulting from the divestment of federally funded programs will likely severely deplete the biomedical workforce, crippling the United States’ ability to deliver future biomedical breakthroughs.
By cutting biomedical research funding, Americans and the rest of the world stand to lose new cures, new treatments and an entire generation of researchers.

Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Health insurance for millions could vanish as states put Medicaid expansion on chopping block

Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.

Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

(Sammy Smith/Nebraska News Service)Nebraska voters should be confident their Xs go where they are intended and are counted in the right pile. We know this from the state’s previous elections being free and fair. Yet, despite the results and the facts and the accurate tabulation of votes, tinkerers remain — those who insist a sky full of hanging chads, “2,000 Mules” and bus loads of immigrants is falling.
The hallmark of that body of nonbelievers (or true believers, whichever you prefer) is its lack of proof that elections in Nebraska — or anywhere else for that matter — are fraught with fraud when their candidate doesn’t win. No amount of verification, substantiation or confirmation convinces them. No number of losing court cases deters them.
Still, we have instances of new voter restrictions based on their beliefs.
For example, without evidence, some argued the possibility of hordes of fraudulent voters would overrun our state system, leading to a new requirement of voter ID with photos. Fair enough. Although the new requirement created very few hitches in our electoral getalongs, as we’ve noted in this space before, if a photo ID requirement disenfranchised one voter, that’s one voter too many.
Changes proposed
Apparently, Nebraska’s outstanding and secure election systems still need tweaking if one believes the basis for Legislative Bill 541. If passed, LB 542 would erect further barriers to register and vote while also somehow denying the science and data on counting votes by hand, which finds hand counts less accurate than machines. The good news is that as of this writing the bill has yet to go anywhere. Nevertheless, its introduction alone is rooted in lies that the 2020 election was peppered with improprieties and, more damaging, calls into question the integrity of county election offices, local election officials and the Secretary of State’s Office. Enough already.
Into this miasmic mix now comes a presidential executive order unnecessarily injecting the federal government into elections. Its first section, “Purpose and Policy,” relies on unproven assertions and outright conspiracy theories that the nation’s ballot boxes are being sullied with the votes of the ineligible, especially non-citizens. Those numbers are infinitesimal if at all. 
Nevertheless, the order says as a country we have failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protections.” Not according to the metrics we use to measure such things.
The order came shortly after an unprecedented national security breach was uncovered, involving the administration, and the denial fiasco that followed, calling the timing into question. More problematic, however, is that the action seemed to move the federal government into a space previously reserved for states and local municipalities, countermanding or diluting their power to hold elections. 
That’s a constitutionally bad look.
Requirements clear
In case the feds are asking, here’s what it takes to register to vote in Nebraska:

Be a United States citizen.
Be at least 18 years of age on or before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
Live in the State of Nebraska.
Have not been convicted of a felony, or if convicted, have completed your sentence for the felony, including any parole term.
Have not been officially found to be mentally incompetent.

What remains to be seen is whether the order moves Nebraska or any other state to alter how it runs its elections, including the registration process, the actual voting, the processes used to tabulate the votes and the reporting of the results. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evenen recently spoke in favor of the order, if only to help election officials better identify who is a citizen. But executive orders come and go as presidents come and go. Not so acts of state legislatures and Congress, which write laws.
In the 2024 general election, 156,302,318 of us showed up to vote. That was 63.9 percent of those eligible to vote. If you’re keeping score at home, Wisconsin led the league with nearly 77 percent turnout, while in beautiful Hawaii only half of eligible voters marked their X. Nebraska was well-represented in the turnout sweepstakes with 73.9 percent. Its 934,188 was the second-most ballots ever cast in a state election.
But before we thump our chests, remember that more than a quarter of the eligibles in Nebraska stayed home. Nationally the number was more than a third. Turnout here and across the country was historically high but did nothing to dispel the usual math that a good portion of eligible voters continue to disenfranchise themselves by failing to register or to vote.
Which is why, rather than littering the voting process with hurdles and hoops and questionable executive orders, we should be spending more time, money and political capital on increasing the number of voters exercising their civic duty.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill originally designed to encourage safe gun storage now includes a controversial tax break on firearm purchases, and a proposed database that was seen as the central element of a school safety bill has been dropped in response to privacy concerns.
The compromises were forged as lawmakers head into the final week of the 2025 legislative session – the first since a 14-year-old accused gunman killed two other students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in September.
Lawmakers have until this Friday to send bills to the governor, who then has 40 days to decide whether to sign them into law.
Safe storage incentive spliced with sales tax holiday for guns, accessories
A House bill that would have created a $300 income tax break for firearm safes and other safe storage devices now only applies to gun safety training.
And the bill – which had passed overwhelmingly in the House and with bipartisan support – has been spliced together with a Senate bill creating a sales tax holiday in October for the purchase of firearms, ammunition and other accessories, like scopes and magazines – as well as gun safes.
The Senate Finance Committee advanced the measure Friday.
  Rep. Mark Newton (right), an Augusta Republican, and Dallas Republican Sen. Jason Anavitarte talk about a compromise they struck over rival proposals to offer tax breaks for gun safes and firearms. The Senate Finance Committee advanced the bill over the objection of some Democrats. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
A similar version of the Senate bill, sponsored by Dallas Republican Sen. Jason Anavitarte, passed in the Senate this session with a party-line vote. The proposal originally called for an 11-day tax holiday, but it has been shrunk to a four-day window under the compromise.
The House proposal stalled largely over concerns among Second Amendment advocates that the tax incentive would create a registry or a record of who benefited from it. 
Rep. Mark Newton, an Augusta Republican who is the bill’s sponsor, said Friday that the proposal is a way to promote gun safety training in a “Second Amendment-friendly way” while also saving taxpayers money.
Democrats immediately objected.
“We took a responsible gun ownership bill and turned it into a gun proliferation bill,” Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, said after the committee vote Friday.
Republicans dismissed those concerns.
“Isn’t true if you’re going to buy a safe that you need to buy a gun to put in it,” said Sen. Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican who serves as Senate majority leader.
Not all Democrats opposed the bill, though. Sen. Michael “Doc” Rhett, a Marietta Democrat, voted for it because he said sees it as “a start.”
“Anything that will promote gun safety is a good start,” Rhett said.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, told reporters Friday that he still thought “the larger picture is being accomplished, and that’s to ensure that we have gun storage, gun safety devices that are available to Georgians.”
“I just want to see us get something done,” Burns said.
Gun safety advocates who spoke at an already-planned press conference at the state Capitol Friday blasted the compromise. Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat who has pushed for gun storage requirements, said HB 79 has been “essentially completely neutered.”
“I’m not exactly sure what this bill aims to do at this point,” Au said Friday. “I don’t know if they think that the activists who are here and the students and the families that are listening are stupid enough to think that this is action on gun safety.”
Heather Hallett, the founder and director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety, said the House measure went from a promotion of safe storage to “a tax bill related to guns and related gun products.”
“We have a problem with safe storage (in Georgia) and the fact that our Legislature, after the worst school shooting in Georgia’s history, cannot unequivocally take up some legislation to say Georgians should adopt safe storage practices – that’s a real statement of where our Legislature stands on gun safety,” Hallett said. 
House Republicans have also revived a controversial Senate proposal that targets a Savannah ordinance penalizing gun owners who leave their firearms in unlocked vehicles. If passed, someone facing a fine would be able to sue the city for as much as $25,000 in damages. That measure was added to Senate Bill 204 last week.
Database cut from high-priority school safety bill
Burns’ signature school safety bill passed unanimously through a Senate committee Thursday, but with some key elements stripped out.
One of the most controversial aspects of House Bill 268 was the creation of a statewide database of information on students who might pose a threat to school safety. That provision was removed after an outcry from parents and child advocates who worried that youthful mistakes or behaviors caused by disabilities could follow a student and harm their future opportunities.
  Sen. Bill Cowsert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“An amazing number of parents, particularly of teenage boys, who, by definition, they are immature and compulsive and do dumb things were fearful that their child might end up having a stigma attached to them of having a record that would go with them permanently about some stupid comment, threat, or behavior they had done as a teenager when, in fact, they were really not criminal, never engaged in criminal behavior, just immature behavior,” said Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert, who is sponsoring the bill in the Senate.
The bill, which is 57 pages long, still touches myriad aspects of school safety. It would require public schools to implement a panic button system and share data with local law enforcement including school maps.
It would also require schools to more quickly share data when a student transfers, a response to the Apalachee shooting in which the accused gunman had allegedly been interviewed by the FBI in connection with shooting threats at a different school in another district more than a year before the attack.
“You can see this is an extraordinarily comprehensive approach to addressing the known problems we have with school violence,” Cowsert said Thursday to his Senate colleagues. “And hopefully, with God’s help, we won’t have another Apalachee in this state.” 
The bill will have to go back to both the House and Senate by April 4 if it is to become law this year.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Burns was comfortable with the bill’s chances and about the database being removed from the bill.
“This is a great process we have up here,” he said. “I think we all come together, we deal with the facts, sometimes we have a little different viewpoints, and final passage of anything is never the final statement on it. So, we look forward to working with the Senate next week, and I believe they’ll get school safety across the finish line, and I know that it will offer protections for our students in Georgia for a safe learning place.”
Though the measure passed the Senate committee unanimously, some still hope to see the bill changed before it heads to the chambers.
  Rep. Michelle Au speaks at a press conference Friday. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Some child advocates say parts of the bill calling for trial as an adult for teenagers charged with making terroristic threats against a school could sweep children, especially children of color, into the justice system for youthful behavior.
Au said she is grateful that Burns is prioritizing safety in schools, but she’s disappointed the bill makes no mention of firearms despite concerns about the danger of shootings. 
“When we talked about the cell phone bans in schools, which was presented as a bill to increase student performance and concentration and reduce distractions in schools, most of the objections I heard about that bill reverted back to the argument about school safety and how are kids going to call us if there’s a school shooting?” she said.
Au was referring to House Bill 340, a ban on personal devices for students through middle school, which passed both chambers and is awaiting Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature. Several lawmakers indicated that they agree with the principle of removing cell phones in schools to increase student focus but said the idea of a child not being able to call 911 or text loved ones in case of an emergency gave them pause.
“Everyone’s thinking about it,” Au said. “I it’s a really conspicuous omission therefore to have any legislative push, an omnibus bill that has many different aspects to it addressing school safety, but to leave out the most obvious piece of it that any parent or any student will tell you is top of mind.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderUnless something out of the ordinary happens, the Georgia Legislature only meets for 40 days each year over the course of about three months.
The last day of the session is called sine die, which is Latin for “without a day,” because the lawmakers adjourn without a date set for their next meeting. The final day for this year’s session is April 4.
The buildup to sine die is always dramatic, with legislators scrambling to get their bills heard and passed. Sometimes, they can even get a little sneaky by reviving legislation that, based on procedure, should not be able to pass.
Issues important to Georgians like gun storage and school safety as well as whether diversity, equity and inclusion should be taught in schools could be decided this week. Lawmakers also still have to hash out an agreement on a spending plan for next year.
Here are some of the other major pieces of legislation to watch out for as the Gold Dome’s final countdown begins.
RFRA
Republican lawmakers have been trying for a decade to pass a statewide religious freedom bill, but those efforts have fallen short amid outcry from LGBTQ advocates.
This year, a RFRA bill – short for Religious Freedom Restoration Act – is just about as close to navigating the Legislature as it’s ever been.
  Sen. Ed Setzler presents his RFRA bill. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler has shepherded the RFRA bill, Senate Bill 36, through the senate as well as a couple of contentious House committee hearings. A successful vote in the House would put the bill on Kemp’s desk.
Setzler says the bill would give religious Georgians the same protections from state and local governments that they get from the First Amendment on the federal level.
Opponents say that because Georgia does not have a comprehensive civil rights law, a RFRA bill would allow business owners who have faith-based beef with LGBTQ people to refuse to serve them.
Transgender bills
Depending on how the week goes, transgender Georgians could lose the rights to play on girls’ school sports teams, obtain puberty blockers or receive gender affirming care from the state health care plan.
The session began with competing House and Senate bills aimed at protecting women’s sports by keeping transgender women out of them.
Senate Bill 1 now seems to be the more likely bill to pass. It would prevent students designated male at birth from playing on teams for girls or women from K-12 through college in both public and private schools. It would also impose gender-based restrictions on locker rooms, changing facilities and restrooms. It does not include additional measures that were originally part of the House plan that remove references to gender from state code.
  Sen. Blake Tillery. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Transgender adults who work for the state government or their dependents could lose the ability to get gender-affirming care like surgeries or hormone treatments through the state health insurance plan.
Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery’s Senate Bill 39 would shut that off starting next year.
Tillery said taxpayer dollars should not go to transgender medical services.
Transgender advocates call the bill a mean-spirited attempt to gin up political support that could end up costing more money in lawsuits than it saves.
Whether or not you’re on the state health insurance plan, a specific set of drugs that block sex hormones and can delay puberty could become harder to get next year.
Savannah Republican Sen. Ben Watson’s Senate Bill 30 originally banned puberty-blocking medications outright for transgender minors but was amended in committee to make them more difficult to get. If the bill passes and is signed into law, the drugs could not be prescribed without seeing multiple specialized medical providers.
Because they were amended, SB 30 and SB 1 will need to pass both chambers to have a shot at becoming law. The state House could vote on SB 39 any time before Sine Die, which would set it up for Kemp’s pen.
Pro-LGBTQ advocacy groups have called on supporters to visit the Capitol this week to urge lawmakers to oppose RFRA and the transgender bill, which they are calling the “slate of hate”

Among them were Dianne Canales and Anna Kabir, who work at Druid Hills Primary Care, which provides gender-affirming care.
“Basically, we’re here to advocate for our transgender patients and make sure that the laws that they’re planning to pass are not gonna prohibit them from getting access to health care,” Canales said.
Canales said both SB 39 and SB 30 would affect the patients in their practice.
“We have patients both on that type of insurance and taking the hormones,” she said. “And so passing something that’s going to prevent them from getting coverage, is gonna affect our practice tremendously, but not just our practice, but our community, and our patients. It’s going to have a detrimental impact on their mental health needs.”
Sanctuary cities
Another Tillery bill, Senate Bill 21, targets so-called sanctuary cities by allowing them to be held civilly liable for crimes committed by undocumented migrants.
This has long been a goal of Republican state lawmakers, but last year’s killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley at the University of Georgia ignited calls to emphasize deporting undocumented immigrants. A Venezuelan man immigration authorities say crossed into the country illegally was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for Riley’s murder.
A bill passed last year in the wake of Riley’s death allows the state to strip funding from cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, and soon after he took office in January, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping immigration bill into law named after Riley.
Senate Democrats argued that the bill is cruel and could result in overcrowded jails and lawsuits against cities.
The House can cast a final vote for SB 21 to send the legislation to the governor’s desk.
Elections

Before the session is scheduled to wrap up Friday, lawmakers could likely pass legislation changing state election rulemaking procedures, ban the state from being a member of a multi-state voter list accuracy system and implement other voting law changes.
Last week, Republican legislators advanced this session’s most extensive election bills out of House and Senate committees, after some significant last minute changes were made that its sponsors said should alleviate some criticisms heard during public meetings.
The most sweeping measures were House Bill 397 and Senate Bill 197, which have the same proposals for restricting the State Election Board from rulemaking within 60 days of an election and banning voters from dropping off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day.
The bills also began the state’s  transition from participating in the Electronic Registration Information Center, an organization that currently provides two dozen states a database to help maintain accurate voter rolls.

Brad Little vetoed a bill to ban Idaho businesses, local and state governments, private and public schools, and colleges and universities from requiring medical interventions, such as vaccines, treatment or medication.
Senate Bill 1023, called the Idaho Medical Freedom Act, would have banned businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services. 
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
Little vetoed the bill Saturday — the first bill the Idaho governor has vetoed this year. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Medical freedom is an Idaho value. However, this bill removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions including measles, lice, ringworm, pink eye, strep throat, stomach viruses, the flu, and other illnesses that disrupt families’ lives,” Little wrote in a transmittal letter explaining his veto.
This year, Little signed into law a bill to let Idaho doctors and health care entities refuse care that violates their beliefs. He cited that bill as one of several examples of his support of “true medical freedom in Idaho.”
“We are proud that Idaho already boasts the freest laws in the country when it comes to personal medical decisions, and we need to keep it that way,” Little wrote. “Parents already have enough to worry about while raising their children. They do not need government imposing more limitations on keeping children safe and healthy from contagious illnesses at school.”
 Bill would’ve expanded on businesses COVID vaccine requirement ban

In 2022, Little vetoed a bill that would ban Idaho businesses from requiring COVID vaccines.
“I have been consistent in stating my belief that businesses should be left to make decisions about the management of their operations and employees with limited interference from government,” Little wrote in his transmittal letter explaining his veto. 
The new broader medical intervention requirement ban the governor vetoed would have expanded on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements, which Little signed in 2023, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
This year’s broader bill — amended twice — was cosponsored by Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, and Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend. Health Freedom Defense Fund President and Founder Leslie Manookian wrote the bill. 
 Citing Idaho doctor who spread COVID disinformation, Idaho GOP chairwoman pushed for governor to sign bill

In a column published Thursday, Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon urged people to ask Little to sign the bill. 
She referenced support for the bill by Dr. Ryan Cole, an Idaho pathologist whose Washington medical license has been restricted after state regulators found he shared COVID disinformation and broke medical standards by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID patients, against medical practice, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
“In 2020 and 2021, it felt like the whole world had gone mad,” Moon wrote. “Many of us feared for the future of freedom in America. But this is 2025, and much has changed since those dark days. The American people sent Donald Trump back to the White House with a mandate to set things right. He, in turn, appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead Health & Human Services. Like Dr. Cole, RFK Jr. has long been skeptical of Big Pharma’s rhetoric and the government overreach that enabled it.”
Idaho Freedom Action, the lobbying arm of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, in an email alert Saturday said the governor “betrayed Idaho,” arguing Little “chose special interests” over “the interests of Idaho’s families.” The group asked supporters to send form emails to Idaho state lawmakers requesting they override the governor’s veto. 
Overriding a gubernatorial veto requires two-thirds support in each chamber of the Idaho Legislature. The bill narrowly passed the Senate on a 19-14 vote, and the House passage barely cleared that two-third threshold on a 47-23 vote. 
 Bill allows limited medical intervention mandates

Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” 
Business medical intervention mandates for employment would still be allowed in a few excepted circumstances, including in certain federal travel scenarios if jobs require entry into facilities that require medical interventions, or if required by federal law. 
The bill would also exempt medical intervention bans in situations where employers require “personal protection equipment, items, or clothing … based on existing traditional and accepted industry standards or federal law.” But the bill says COVID-era requirements, such as for masks or vaccines, are not exempt from the ban.
The bill would allow the Idaho attorney general or county prosecuting attorneys to enforce the law through injunctive relief, which are essentially civil court actions issued in lawsuits.

About 25 million Americans live in dentist shortage areas, according to new research from Harvard University. (Katie Adkins/For KFF Health News)
This article first appeared on KFF Health News and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.

In the wooded highlands of northern Arkansas, where small towns have few dentists, water officials who serve more than 20,000 people have for more than a decade openly defied state law by refusing to add fluoride to the drinking water.
For its refusal, the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority has received hundreds of state fines amounting to about $130,000, which are stuffed in a cardboard box and left unpaid, said Andy Anderson, who is opposed to fluoridation and has led the water system for nearly two decades.
This Ozark region is among hundreds of rural American communities that face a one-two punch to oral health: a dire shortage of dentists and a lack of fluoridated drinking water, which is widely viewed among dentists as one of the most effective tools to prevent tooth decay. But as the anti-fluoride movement builds unprecedented momentum, it may turn out that the Ozarks were not behind the times after all.
“We will eventually win,” Anderson said. “We will be vindicated.”
Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, keeps teeth strong when added to drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association. But the anti-fluoride movement has been energized since a government report last summer found a possible link between lower IQ in children and consuming amounts of fluoride that are higher than what is recommended in American drinking water. Dozens of communities have decided to stop fluoridating in recent months, and state officials in Florida and Texas have urged their water systems to do the same. Utah is poised to become the first state to ban it in tap water.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long espoused fringe health theories, has called fluoride an “industrial waste” and “dangerous neurotoxin” and said the Trump administration will recommend it be removed from all public drinking water.
Separately, Republican efforts to extend tax cuts and shrink federal spending may squeeze Medicaid, which could deepen existing shortages of dentists in rural areas where many residents depend on the federal insurance program for whatever dental care they can find.
Dental experts warn that the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid and fluoridation could exacerbate a crisis of rural oral health and reverse decades of progress against tooth decay, particularly for children and those who rarely see a dentist.
“If you have folks with little access to professional care and no access to water fluoridation,” said Steven Levy, a dentist and leading fluoride researcher at the University of Iowa, “then they are missing two of the big pillars of how to keep healthy for a lifetime.”
Many already are.

Overlapping ‘Dental Deserts’ and Fluoride-Free Zones
Nearly 25 million Americans live in areas without enough dentists — more than twice as many as prior estimates by the federal government — according to a recent study from Harvard University that measured U.S. “dental deserts” with more depth and precision than before.
Hawazin Elani, a Harvard dentist and epidemiologist who co-authored the study, found that many shortage areas are rural and poor, and depend heavily on Medicaid. But many dentists do not accept Medicaid because payments can be low, Elani said.
The ADA has estimated that only a third of dentists treat patients on Medicaid.
“I suspect this situation is much worse for Medicaid beneficiaries,” Elani said. “If you have Medicaid and your nearest dentists do not accept it, then you will likely have to go to the third, or fourth, or the fifth.”
The Harvard study identified over 780 counties where more than half of the residents live in a shortage area. Of those counties, at least 230 also have mostly or completely unfluoridated public drinking water, according to a KFF analysis of fluoride data published by the CDC. That means people in these areas who can’t find a dentist also do not get protection for their teeth from their tap water.
The KFF Health News analysis does not cover the entire nation because it does not include private wells and 13 states do not submit fluoride data to the CDC. But among those that do, most counties with a shortage of dentists and unfluoridated water are in the south-central U.S., in a cluster that stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle and up into Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
In the center of that cluster is the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority, which serves the Arkansas counties of Boone, Marion, Newton, and Searcy. It has refused to add fluoride ever since Arkansas enacted a statewide mandate in 2011. After weekly fines began in 2016, the water system unsuccessfully challenged the fluoride mandate in state court, then lost again on appeal.
Anderson, who has chaired the water system’s board since 2007, said he would like to challenge the fluoride mandate in court again and would argue the case himself if necessary. In a phone interview, Anderson said he believes that fluoride can hamper the brain and body to the point of making people “get fat and lazy.”
“So if you go out in the streets these days, walk down the streets, you’ll see lots of fat people wearing their pajamas out in public,” he said.
Nearby in the tiny, no-stoplight community of Leslie, Arkansas, which gets water from the Ozark system, the only dentist in town operates out of a one-man clinic tucked in the back of an antique store. Hand-painted lettering on the store window advertises a “pretty good dentist.”
James Flanagin, a third-generation dentist who opened this clinic three years ago, said he was drawn to Leslie by the quaint charms and friendly smiles of small-town life. But those same smiles also reveal the unmistakable consequences of refusing to fluoridate, he said.
“There is no doubt that there is more dental decay here than there would otherwise be,” he said. “You are going to have more decay if your water is not fluoridated. That’s just a fact.”

Fluoride Seen as a Great Public Health Achievement
Fluoride was first added to public water in an American city in 1945 and spread to half of the U.S. population by 1980, according to the CDC. Because of “the dramatic decline” in cavities that followed, in 1999 the CDC dubbed fluoridation as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
Currently more than 70% of the U.S. population on public water systems get fluoridated water, with a recommended concentration of 0.7 milligrams per liter, or about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, according to the CDC.
Fluoride is also present in modern toothpaste, mouthwash, dental varnish, and some food and drinks — like raisins, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee, and black tea. But several dental experts said these products do not reliably reach as many low-income families as drinking water, which has an additional benefit over toothpaste of strengthening children’s teeth from within as they grow.
Two recent polls have found that the largest share of Americans support fluoridation, but a sizable minority does not. Polls from Axios/Ipsos and AP-NORC found that 48% and 40% of respondents wanted to keep fluoride in public water supplies, while 29% and 26% supported its removal.
Chelsea Fosse, an expert on oral health policy at the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, said she worried that misguided fears of fluoride would cause many people to stop using fluoridated toothpaste and varnish just as Medicaid cuts made it harder to see a dentist.
The combination, she said, could be “devastating.”
“It will be visibly apparent what this does to the prevalence of tooth decay,” Fosse said. “If we get rid of water fluoridation, if we make Medicaid cuts, and if we don’t support providers in locating and serving the highest-need populations, I truly don’t know what we will do.”
Multiple peer-reviewed studies have shown what ending water fluoridation could look like. In the past few years, studies of cities in Alaska and Canada have shown that communities that stopped fluoridation saw significant increases in children’s cavities when compared with similar cities that did not. A 2024 study from Israel reported a “two-fold increase” in dental treatments for kids within five years after the country stopped fluoridating in 2014.
Despite the benefits of fluoridation, it has been fiercely opposed by some since its inception, said Catherine Hayes, a Harvard dental expert who advises the American Dental Association on fluoride and has studied its use for three decades.

Fluoridation was initially smeared as a communist plot against America, Hayes said, and then later fears arose of possible links to cancer, which were refuted through extensive scientific research. In the ’80s, hysteria fueled fears of fluoride causing AIDS, which was “ludicrous,” Hayes said.
More recently, the anti-fluoride movement seized on international research that suggests high levels of fluoride can hinder children’s brain development and has been boosted by high-profile legal and political victories.
Last August, a hotly debated report from the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program found “with moderate confidence” that exposure to levels of fluoride that are higher than what is present in American drinking water is associated with lower IQ in children. The report was based on an analysis of 74 studies conducted in other countries, most of which were considered “low quality” and involved exposure of at least 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water — or more than twice the U.S. recommendation — according to the program.
The following month, in a long-simmering lawsuit filed by fluoride opponents, a federal judge in California said the possible link between fluoride and lowered IQ was too risky to ignore, then ordered the federal Environmental Protection Agency to take nonspecified steps to lower that risk. The EPA started to appeal this ruling in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump administration could reverse course.
The EPA and Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about fluoride.
Despite the National Toxicology Program’s report, Hayes said, no association has been shown to date between lowered IQ and the amount of fluoride actually present in most Americans’ water. The court ruling may prompt additional research conducted in the U.S., Hayes said, which she hoped would finally put the campaign against fluoride to rest.
“It’s one of the great mysteries of my career, what sustains it,” Hayes said. “What concerns me is that there’s some belief amongst some members of the public — and some of our policymakers — that there is some truth to this.”
Not all experts were so dismissive of the toxicology program’s report. Bruce Lanphear, a children’s health researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, published an editorial in January that said the findings should prompt health organizations “to reassess the risks and benefits of fluoride, particularly for pregnant women and infants.”
“The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it’s safe,” Lanphear told NPR in January. “That’s what this study does. It shifts the burden of proof — or it should.”

Cities and States Rethink Fluoride
At least 14 states so far this year have considered or are considering bills that would lift fluoride mandates or prohibit fluoride in drinking water altogether. In February, Utah lawmakers passed the nation’s first ban, which Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told ABC4 Utah he intends to sign. And both Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have called for their respective states to end fluoridation.
“I don’t want Big Brother telling me what to do,” Miller told The Dallas Morning News in February. “Government has forced this on us for too long.”
Additionally, dozens of cities and counties have decided to stop fluoridation in the past six months — including at least 16 communities in Florida with a combined population of more than 1.6 million — according to news reports and the Fluoride Action Network, an anti-fluoride group.
Stuart Cooper, executive director of that group, said the movement’s unprecedented momentum would be further supercharged if Kennedy and the Trump administration follow through on a recommendation against fluoride.
Cooper predicted that most U.S. communities will have stopped fluoridating within years.
“I think what you are seeing in Florida, where every community is falling like dominoes, is going to now happen in the United States,” he said. “I think we’re seeing the absolute end of it.”
If Cooper’s prediction is right, Hayes said, widespread decay would be visible within years. Kids’ teeth will rot in their mouths, she said, even though “we know how to completely prevent it.”
“It’s unnecessary pain and suffering,” Hayes said. “If you go into any children’s hospital across this country, you’ll see a waiting list of kids to get into the operating room to get their teeth fixed because they have severe decay because they haven’t had access to either fluoridated water or other types of fluoride. Unfortunately, that’s just going to get worse.”
 



Methodology: How We Counted
This KFF Health News article identifies communities with an elevated risk of tooth decay by combining data on areas with dentist shortages and unfluoridated drinking water. Our analysis merged Harvard University research on dentist-shortage areas with large datasets on public water systems published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Harvard research determined that nearly 25 million Americans live in dentist-shortage areas that span much of rural America. The CDC data details the populations served and fluoridation status of more than 38,000 public water systems in 37 states. We classified counties as having elevated risk of tooth decay if they met three criteria:More than half of the residents live in a dentist-shortage area identified by Harvard.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to more than half of the county’s population.The number of people receiving unfluoridated water from water systems based in that county amounts to at least half of the total population of all water systems based in that county, even if those systems reached beyond the county borders, which many do.
Our analysis identified approximately 230 counties that meet these criteria, meaning they have both a dire shortage of dentists and largely unfluoridated drinking water.
But this total is certainly an undercount. Thirteen states do not report water system data to the CDC, and the agency data does not include private wells, most of which are unfluoridated.

Cox explained [&#8230;]","A pride flag flies at the Salt Lake City & County Building on Thursday, March 13, 2025. (McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)SALT LAKE CITY — Saying Utahns are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox will allow a bill aimed at banning many flags — including pride or LGBTQ+ flags — from schools and all government buildings to become law without his signature.
Cox explained his reasoning in a letter to legislative leaders issued with just over an hour to spare before his midnight deadline Thursday to sign or veto bills passed by the 2025 Utah Legislature.
“HB77 has been one of the most divisive bills of the session, and I am deeply disappointed that it did not land in a better place,” wrote Cox, who also explained he agreed with the intent behind the legislation. “My understanding is that there was a deal on a compromise that would have removed problematic portions of the bill while retaining others that would support political neutrality in the classroom. Sadly the sponsors did not move that deal forward.”
Supporters of HB77, sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, argued it was meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces. But critics argued a broad ban that extended to all government properties would invite free speech litigation while also leaving some Utahns, especially the LGBTQ+ community, feeling unwelcome and erased.

Now slated to take effect on May 7, HB77 will ban almost all flags from being displayed on or in public buildings, except for flags explicitly allowed in a prescriptive list included in the bill, such as the U.S. flag, the state flag, military flags, Olympic flags, college or university flags, or others. Pride flags or other LGBTQ+ flags — which Utah lawmakers in recent years have repeatedly tried to bar from schools in various ways — would be prohibited.
It’s slated to make Utah the first state in the nation to enact such sweeping flag restrictions in government-owned buildings. The Idaho Legislature recently passed a similar bill, HB41, which Gov. Brad Little signed last week, but that legislation won’t take effect until July 1 and it only applies to schools. Idaho lawmakers are also advancing a separate bill to restrict government entities from displaying certain types of flags.

Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ rights group, Equality Utah, had negotiated with lawmakers on the bill, which originally focused the flag ban on school classrooms. However, in a House committee last month, Lee changed the legislation to broaden the flag ban to all government property, leading Equality Utah to oppose the bill even though it was prepared to take a “neutral” position on its earlier version.
Cox faced numerous calls to veto HB77 from advocacy groups including Equality Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, as well as from Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, whose city hosts the annual Utah Pride Festival. He could have vetoed the bill — but he indicated in his letter that it would likely just be overridden by the GOP-supermajority Utah Legislature. Instead, he’s urging lawmakers to work to fix it.
“I continue to have serious concerns with this bill,” Cox said. “However, because a veto would be overridden, I have decided to allow the bill to go into law without my signature, and urge lawmakers to consider commonsense solutions that address the bill’s numerous flaws.”
Cox encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing the Utah State Board of Education to “go further in ensuring the political neutrality of our classrooms, while also considering repealing the local government piece of this legislation and allowing elected representatives to answer to their own constituents.”
“If you are willing to pursue this kind of solution, you will have an open door in the executive branch,” Cox wrote.
Cox’s comments on the flag ban came after the bill cast final-hour drama over Utah’s multimillion-dollar bid to entice the Sundance Film Festival to stay, with some saying it could impact Utah’s chances.
Earlier Thursday, festival organizers announced they’d opted to move the event to Colorado to help the festival grow. By the time they’d reached their decision, Cox had not yet acted on HB77, but a veto was looking unlikely.

While Cox told reporters last week Sundance organizers had told state leaders “very clearly that political issues have nothing to do with the decision,” others, including Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, worried that HB77 could indeed be “harmful to our effort to retain Sundance.”
In the end, Utah lost its bid. Cox — who earlier Thursday called Sundance’s decision a “mistake” — also included a note in his letter that he’ll be calling a special session to address, among other issues, what the Legislature should instead do with the $3.5 million it had set aside as part of Utah’s bid to keep Sundance.
“Let’s reappropriate that money to efforts in Utah to create a new festival and a world-class film economy right here in our state,” he said.
Cox says he agrees with ‘underlying intent’ but HB77 has flaws
Cox, in his letter, dove deeper into why he had misgivings with HB77 but said he agreed with the “underlying intent” of the bill.
“I deeply believe that our classrooms need to be a place where everyone feels welcome — free from the politics that are fracturing our country,” Cox wrote. “Parents are rightly upset when they bring their kids to publicly funded schools and see culture-war symbols in a place that should be apolitical. In an attempt to make some kids feel more welcome, other kids feel less welcome.”
Cox also said he appreciated that the bill is “neutral on the types of flags in question,” while adding that “I find it strange that no headline reads ‘MAGA flags banned from classrooms.’”

“I agree with the underlying intent of those legislators who supported this bill in an attempt to bring political neutrality to the classroom,” he said, though he added, “Unfortunately, this bill does not do that.”
He said because it’s aimed at only flags, “there is little preventing countless other displays — posters, signs, drawings, furniture — from entering the classroom.”
“To those legislators who supported this bill, I’m sure it will not fix what you are trying to fix,” Cox said.
He noted that many schools have already enacted their own “political neutrality” policies in classrooms, and he argued “we have a better place” to make regulations: the Utah State Board of Education. While he said the board has already set expectations for political neutrality in teacher code of conduct, “I believe more needs to be done by USBE to provide direction in this regard.”
“I have asked the Board of Education to continue their work to find ways to make our classrooms both more politically neutral and more welcoming to every student to exercise their own individual freedom of expression,” Cox said. “The idea that kids can only feel welcome in a school if a teacher puts up a rainbow flag is just wrong. Let’s do everything possible to make our classrooms one of the last remaining politically neutral places in our state.”
Cox says bill goes ‘too far’
The governor added that the flag ban “goes too far” by extending the ban to local governments.
“While I think it’s wrong for city and county officials to fly divisive flags, I believe that election have consequences and the best way to stop that behavior is to elect people who believe differently,” Cox said. “All this bill does is add more fuel to the fire, and I suspect it will only ratchet up the creative use of political symbolism.”
Ultimately, Cox urged legislators to focus on solutions rather than legislation that deepens divides.


Let us know what you think...


 

“As tired as Utahns are of politically divisive symbols, I think they are also tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” he said.
The governor urged lawmakers to work with the LGBTQ+ community, as they have in the past, to find common ground.
“Utah has always had a reputation of trying to find a way to work together and solve issues between sides that have strongly-held, opposing points of view,” Cox said. “There are so many examples of the LGBTQ community and the conservative community coming together to find helpful and hopeful compromise. I hope we can retain this as our model and North Star.”
The governor also shared a message directly to LGBTQ+ Utahns, acknowledging that “recent legislation has been difficult.”
“Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we have had our disagreements,” he said. “I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Nine months after historic flooding in McCook Lake wreaked havoc on homes, roads, trees and infrastructure, government officials are widening their focus from recovery efforts to prevention.
McCook Lake is a community of lakefront homes within North Sioux City in the southeastern corner of South Dakota, near the confluence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers.
Raging floodwaters that hit McCook Lake in June cost the city an estimated total of $15 million in infrastructure repair, according to North Sioux City and Union County officials. Homeowners suffered millions in additional damage and received some assistance from federal disaster relief programs, although not enough in some cases to replace their losses. Some also lacked flood insurance.
Local governments consider short-term, long-term mitigation plans
North Sioux City Administrator Jeff Dooley said the city is considering building greenways, culverts and storm sewer pipes along affected roads — capitalizing on some of the channels carved by the flood — to better direct future floodwaters into McCook Lake.
“Mother Nature has already plowed through there,” Dooley said. The city is also exploring how to better convey floodwaters from McCook Lake to the Missouri River “where it doesn’t harm anyone else.”

Dooley said a proposal will be presented to the public in late April for input from area residents and city commissioners. He plans to “hit these concepts hard” before applying for a Federal Emergency Management Agency hazard mitigation grant program by the end of May.
“A lot of damage has been done, and we’re doing our best to get out ahead of things,” Dooley said. “Any solution we come up with has to protect everybody.”
Dooley does not have a cost estimate prepared for the plan yet.

In the long term, Dooley and other area officials are requesting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help reevaluate the current flood plan and develop new mitigation plans. The current plan, which uses levees to redirect floodwaters over Interstate 29 and into McCook Lake before they reach the rest of North Sioux City and nearby Dakota Dunes, was developed in 1976. Union County, North Sioux City and Sioux City wrote a letter to the Corps saying they will sponsor improvement projects recommended by the Corps.
While Dooley said the Corps of Engineers likely recognizes a nearly 50-year-old mitigation plan is outdated, he warned it’ll probably take 10 to 15 years for a study’s conclusions to come to reality. That’s because the project will have a large study scope and a long construction timeline, he said.
Residents continue with recovery, lawmaker seeks to provide future relief
More than 100 homes were damaged in the McCook Lake flood, and 20 homes were demolished by North Sioux City in December. That’s left pockets of empty lots around the north side of the lake.
Morgan Speichinger lives on North Shore Drive, an outlet off the lake’s main road. Before the flood, her family couldn’t see the lake because of the houses lining its shore. Then the raging floodwaters carved a channel toward the river in her family’s backyard and through her neighbors’ houses.
“We didn’t have a lake view. Now, unfortunately, we do,” she said.

Speichinger and her husband rented a skid-steer loader at the end of March to move some of the 66 truckloads of dirt donated by RP Constructors and the Dakota County Fire District to fill holes in their property and in empty neighboring lots.
Other volunteers, such as workers with Mitchell Electric, helped move dirt with vans and trailers.
“I love the help and volunteers willing to step up and help other people, but it’s frustrating that we have to rely on our community to bring us back together,” Speichinger said. “You don’t see the city, county or state leadership out here, but they’re the ones who should be helping.”

Vermillion Republican Rep. Chris Kassin has visited McCook Lake several times, walking the lake and assessing damage done to his constituents’ homes. Kassin led a failed effort to establish a fund for the cleanup and restoration of McCook Lake this legislative session.
Kassin plans to explore legislation to “find a creative solution” to offer state financial support to future natural disaster victims. He plans to work with the state Department of Public Safety, Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Department of Game, Fish and Parks to understand what options are available.
“It showed some gaps in the way we deal with disasters in the state and some of the lack of funding triggers or mechanisms that we might have to help people in need,” Kassin said during a legislative panel Thursday at the University of South Dakota.
Speichinger said she and her family plan to remain in their home because they can’t afford to move elsewhere. She said any mitigation plan North Sioux City presents should include an overhaul of the 1976 plan.
State analyzes prediction and modeling failures
Tim Cowman is the state geologist and director of the South Dakota Geological Survey. In a meeting with the East Dakota Water Development District in late 2024, he said the Big Sioux River flooding came faster and harder than predicted by the National Weather Service. The flooding was caused by three days of rain June 20-22 in southeast South Dakota, surpassing 17 inches in some locations.
Cowman said the water started flowing over I-29 a mile before the levee.
“The flood would have happened at McCook Lake whether or not that levee was there,” Cowman said.

Some residents including Speichinger say the levee over I-29 made the flooding at McCook Lake worse, that they were not properly informed of the plan to install it, and were not sufficiently warned about the potential effects. She, a group of other residents and their attorney have since served the state of South Dakota with a notice of a potential lawsuit over its role in constructing the levee, although no lawsuit has yet been filed.
Cowman said future mitigation measures should plan for flood events like this more often.
“These are 100 and 500 year floods, but they happen every five years now,” Cowman said.

Experts say factors in that change may include more severe precipitation due to climate change, the conversion of sponge-like prairies to farm fields, the installation of drain tile under fields to dump excess moisture into creeks and rivers, and urban sprawl that sends more runoff into waterways.
Cowman helps predict flooding impacts for the state with the South Dakota Flood Information System, which produces flood maps based on different scenarios, including peak flows and breached levees.
Cowman said predictions of the “magnitude” of flooding that struck McCook Lake should be more accurate in the future, because they’ll include data from the 2024 flood.
He and his team met with the National Weather Service Missouri Basin River Forecast Center in Kansas City twice to “work out kinks” and understand modeling and timing failures.
“From the state’s standpoint,” Cowman said, “we’re trying to make sure the river forecast center doesn’t get fooled again on a flood of this magnitude down there.”

Oil prices are projected to decline slightly this year, not because of drill baby drill, but because Trump’s tariffs and their accompanying televised presidential hissy fits are a drag on the economy. Trump met with oil industry executives Wednesday. They love the prospect of Trump cutting their taxes and regulations. But to no one’s surprise, except perhaps Trump’s, in these economic and geopolitical conditions, they (and their shareholders) have almost zero interest in drill baby drilling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen by 5.5% since Trump’s inauguration. The S&P 500 has lost nearly 8% of its value. The Nasdaq Composite Index has dropped by more than 12%. A Deutsche Bank analysis the other day noted that under Trump, U.S. stocks are recording the second-worst post-inauguration performance in nearly 90 years.
“When I take office your 401 (k)  or IRA will start losing money very quickly, almost like nobody’s ever seen before” was not among Trump’s campaign promises. But he delivered on it anyway.
And what about the charismatic megafauna of Trump Nevada-specific policy promises, holy sacred No Tax on Tips amen?
Budget-wise it’s among the smallest of the numerous tax cuts he promised (the lost revenue from No Tax on Social Security income is humongous by comparison). So it might be included in the tax cuts for the rich and corporate that Trump and congressional Republicans are poised to pay for by cutting Medicaid (which will hurt Nevada more than most states, by the way).
At the same time, if tariffs send consumers into a spending tailspin, and tourists (and not just international ones) stop coming to Las Vegas, a lot of folks who might have hoped to catch a No Tax on Tips break may find that the presence or absence of federal taxation of tips is the least of their problems. If it wasn’t already.
Oh, and speaking of Social Security, Trump repeatedly promised while campaigning that he wouldn’t touch it. Yet he’s also enabling and parroting Elon Musk’s attempts to undermine what Musk calls a “Ponzi scheme.”
When he was campaigning Trump also promised to be a dictator on day one, punish his enemies, and concentrate unprecedented and,  according to multiple lower federal courts, unconstitutional authority in the executive branch at the expense of Congress and the judiciary.
Voters knew that was coming, too.
And whether despite that or because of it, a majority of Nevada voters joined a plurality of voters nationally to let Trump have at it.
In stark contrast to his thus-far barren promises that prices will come down and tremendous wealth will wash across the land, Trump has made substantial progress toward fulfilling his promises to establish authoritarian rule while sidelining an obeisant legislative branch and attacking an often game but structurally plodding judicial system.
Now all Trump need do to solidify his regime and its lawlessness going forward is convince voters that a ramshackle wreck of a third-rate economy is a small price to pay for the privilege of being ruled by Trump the Grand Authoritarian and his cadre of cold-blooded henchmen and creepy oligarchs.
What are the odds voters will buy that in the 21st century? Judging from the last 10 years or so, fifty-fifty sounds about right.

Trump also promised that “drill baby drill” would not only “unleash” energy production in the U.S. As he insisted repeatedly at his campaign appearances in Nevada last year, lower energy costs rippling through the economy as a result of drill baby drill was also the centerpiece of his strategy for lowering prices on all other goods and services.

Reid/Kitsap Sun)Tatiana Leone never leaves her Bremerton apartment without a reusable grocery bag filled with documents detailing her son’s history of mental illness. She doesn’t know when she will run into her son, who lives unhoused in Seattle, and she wants to be prepared if he’s in a crisis.
She’s used the pile of documents — including records of his behavioral health history, jail stints and hospital stays — once before. In 2020, she successfully asked a Pierce County judge to involuntarily detain her son, whom she asked not to be named to respect his privacy, under Washington’s Joel’s Law. Leone, like others caring for loved ones experiencing acute mental illness, had spent many painstaking years trying to get her son help, only to find a fractured and complex mental health system that did little more than send her son to jail. She felt like she had exhausted all other options.
“It’s a gut-wrenching process because you don’t want to alienate your loved one and make them fear you or that the world is against them because they’re already thinking that in some cases,” Leone said. “You’re just trying to help.” 
Joel’s Law, which passed the state Legislature with overwhelming support in 2015, was designed to provide a lifeline for parents like Leone who wished to directly petition the judicial system to get their loved one into treatment. Typically, designated crisis responders — mental health professionals who act as a bridge between the medical system and the courts — are the ones to recommend involuntary detainment if they believe someone’s behavioral health conditions meet the state’s legal criteria.
While the law was celebrated for helping to elevate the voices of concerned families, petitioning the court is just one step in a long, complicated process that might not ultimately lead to treatment or sustained support, as Leone and others have experienced. Only three days after Leone’s son was detained, he was released from the hospital and was back cycling through the same systems as before.
Joel’s Law petitions comprise only a small portion of all involuntary detainments in Washington, but the number of cases involving the petitions has increased statewide by 266% since 2020, according to state court data obtained through a public records request. Much of that growth has been concentrated in the South and Central Puget Sound areas. Pierce and Kitsap County, where Leone attempted to get her son detained, have among the highest per-capita rates among Washington’s large counties. 
Medical professionals, mental health providers and lawyers have a longstanding disagreement over involuntary treatment, especially in Washington, where physicians are not allowed to make that call. Some medical professionals and families feel the system is antiquated and leaves too many people without care until they ultimately wind up in the criminal justice system. 
A decade since the law was passed, the use of the petitions is increasing, though questions remain about how much these petitions have helped make treatment more accessible to families. Those skeptical of the law acknowledge there needs to be more access points to behavioral health care but question if involuntary care is the appropriate response or if many of these people could be more effectively treated in the community.

Tara Urs, special counsel for civil policy and practice for the King County Department of Public Defense, feels for the family members submitting these petitions, knowing that the supports available outside of the hospital doors are difficult — and at times impossible —— to access. 
“I understand why people might want to be banging down the only door that might be available, even though I think it is the wrong door,” said Urs, who represents people facing involuntary detention. But the state must meet a high burden of proof before taking away someone’s civil liberties.
“Joel’s Law increased the kinds of people who could try to access the front door of the hospital, and for King County, I’m not sure how much of an impact that’s made,” she added. “But I don’t think that means that there’s not a problem worth solving.”
Number of petitions on the rise
A group of parents, frustrated that their loved ones with acute mental illnesses were not getting help, pushed for the passage of Joel’s Law in 2015. Doug and Nancy Reuter, whose son Joel became the law’s namesake, helped bring attention to the issue. Seattle police fatally shot Joel, a 28-year-old software engineer suffering from bipolar disorder, in 2013. The Reuters said they tried 48 times prior to that standoff to get their son help.
“What was happening everywhere — and I certainly heard about it in our area — was parents would be told, ‘Well we can’t do anything until they break the law,’ even though the parent knew the child was in grave danger of hurting themselves or somebody else,” said Kitsap County Commissioner Christine Rolfes, a former state senator who was a co-sponsor of the bill creating Joel’s Law.
Michael Kawamura, who oversees Pierce County’s public defender office, suspects the high number of Joel’s Law petitions filed in Pierce County could be due to the county being home to the largest psychiatric hospital in the state, Western State Hospital. A person can be held up to five days for an emergency detention, potentially followed by a 14-day treatment with additional 90- or 180-day extensions. With each extension, a new petition must be filed with the court, which could increase the number being filed in Pierce County.
“The majority of counties don’t do most of the long-term commitments,” said Kawamura, who helps oversee cases involving Joel’s Law petitions. “That’s just the hospital jurisdictions. And so most of the counties will do that initial 14-day commitment, but then they stop.”
Providers attribute much of the increase to more awareness. Police and mental health workers are educating families about Joel’s Law, and in some areas, the complex process to file a petition has been streamlined. 
“It’s 10 years old,” Jenna Vyhlidal, manager of mobile crisis outreach at Kitsap Mental Health Services, said of Joel’s Law, “but I think we’re finally starting to make it work.”
Dr. James Hughes, chief medical officer at Kitsap Mental Health Services, speculates that some of the difference between counties can be attributed to differing interpretations of state statutes. State laws on involuntary detainment are vague and open to nuanced interpretation. The definition of “imminent” — a requirement for someone to be involuntarily detained — is an example of that.
“I’ve heard it used differently by different counties or even different institutions,” he said.
Kitsap is among the counties where crisis responders are permitted to do single-bed certifications, allowing them to detain someone at a local hospital if no inpatient psychiatric beds are available throughout the state. Kitsap also permits non-emergent detention, letting crisis responders petition to detain someone who is not yet an imminent threat to themselves or others but is showing signs of a deteriorating mental state. 
“It lets us do our job but prevent future [crises] so we’re not five days behind,” Vyhlidal said.
By design, medical providers have few options to force a patient into treatment, especially in Washington. The state’s Involuntary Treatment Act was established in the 1970s amid the national “deinstitutionalization” movement that sought to release hundreds of thousands of people held in psychiatric hospitals and move away from the system that gave doctors the sole power to strip someone of their civil liberties.
“If I agree their loved one is in need of help, I can’t make them get it. I have to defer to somebody who did not see you in your acute crisis and may not have the same perspective on medical care or training as I do as the ER clinician caring for you,” said Nathan Schlicher, an emergency room physician who lives in Gig Harbor and is a past president of the Washington State Medical Association. “That is the unique nature of Washington law.”
One family’s journey using Joel’s Law
When Leone’s son’s mental health conditions started to escalate in his late teens, she didn’t know where to turn. She had brought him to the emergency room during a handful of episodes but was often turned away. She had heard of designated crisis responders but was told that the only way to get her son evaluated was to call the police. She tried this numerous times, which often led to him being taken to jail, she said.
“He really just needed help and intervention,” she said. “It didn’t help my son at all, because oftentimes, while in custody, their solution for people in mental health crisis is solitary confinement, and that’s not helpful either.”
On Christmas Eve in 2020, Leone’s son was in acute crisis, in a state of heightened fear and expressing thoughts of self-harm. Leone brought him to St. Anthony’s Hospital in Gig Harbor in hopes that he would be seen by a designated crisis responder from Pierce County instead of in Kitsap County, where they had been evaluated previously but involuntary detainment was not recommended, she said. While she was out getting her son warmer clothes, a designated crisis responder came and went without recommending involuntary detainment. Her son then ran away.

She was angry with the hospital staff for letting him walk out the door in the middle of a snowstorm. They told her there was nothing they could do. Not knowing what to do next, Leone drove to a nearby Target parking lot and called the police. “My son happened to bump right into me in a Target parking lot,” she recalled.
While Leone was on the phone with the 911 operator, her son was talking about harming himself. She asked the operator if she could hear his comments. “One of the (designated crisis responder’s) had told me that unless we hear him say he wants to kill himself to us, or unless we hear it with our own ears, we cannot just take anybody’s word for it.”
The next thing she knew, police were surrounding her car. The 911 operator told her that they would contact the designated crisis responder to come out. Instead, they arrested him and charged him with domestic violence, which prohibited him from contacting Leone. She had told the officers that she wasn’t in danger. “I am not afraid of my son,” she recalled telling them. “I called you to help him.”
“It was unbelievable,” she said. “I am his only support system. He doesn’t have a dad, he doesn’t have any other family or anybody else who advocates for him. So they alienated him from his sole support network.”
After he was taken to jail, Leone called the crisis line back. 
That’s when she was told about Joel’s Law. She says she “thought it was going to be the answer we were looking for.” 
Families have 10 days after a designated crisis responder evaluates their loved one to file a Joel’s Law petition with a judge. The petition includes the reasons the family believes someone should be detained. That often provides a more comprehensive look at someone’s history than what a designated crisis responder can necessarily see at the moment, said  Vyhlidal, the Kitsap crisis outreach manager. 
“I’ve seen petitions go back to childhood photos,” she said.
When a judge grants a Joel’s Law petition, the same process follows as when a designated crisis responder detains someone. They are held for a maximum of 120 hours (plus holidays and weekends) during which a mental health professional decides if they need to be committed for longer. 
The day after Leone’s son was taken to jail and she learned about Joel’s Law, she started gathering the hundreds of documents she was told she needed to file the petition, including documentation of hospital stays, jail stints and admittance to crisis care. The process was arduous.
She was told she had to file the petition in person in Tacoma, but she couldn’t get out of her driveway due to snow. She took an Uber to a FedEx store in Bremerton and spent $200 faxing the documents to the court.
They ultimately approved her petition and served him the paperwork when he was in jail. She said it was painful not to be able to reassure him given the protection order stemming from the DV charge. When she finally spoke to him, he was rightfully upset, she said.
“He thought that I was just out to get him and take him down, which was part of his symptoms, too,” Leone said. “Which kind of makes sense looking back, because his intuition is telling him something was wrong, and he doesn’t know where to look for the source of this feeling, and so everybody becomes a suspect.”
After three days in the hospital and one day back in jail, he was released, and Leone felt like she was back to square one. “I thought they had said that they were going to keep him until he was stabilized,” she said.
Skepticism remains
Silvia Riley, the director of crisis services at Multicare, is lukewarm on Joel’s Law. It is not a bad policy, she said. Designated crisis responders, while highly trained, make mistakes. But she wants judges to apply the same scrutiny to petitions that designated crisis responders do to their evaluations. Detention should be a last resort.
“We show up with the intention of [involuntary commitment] being the last thing we want to do,” she said. “It’s not always a popular decision, but we take it very seriously.”
Judges, she argues, feel compelled to help individuals experiencing severe mental illness, often receiving thick petitions documenting someone’s whole and often traumatic history. But while many people need behavioral health treatment, designated crisis responders often disagree that an involuntary approach is the best method for that care.
For example, MultiCare was once asked to detain someone but could not serve them because they were at work every day.
“That itself tells me that this person is not a good candidate for involuntary commitment, because he’s living productively,” she said, adding later: “It makes me question, is this the best way to get them help? Or are we missing some opportunities in the community?”
The practice of involuntarily detaining someone at a mental hospital has a dark and not-so-distant history. For example, women were frequently institutionalized in mental hospitals for not being submissive enough to their husbands. It’s why the bar is so high for committing someone, Urs said.
Urs wants to see a more holistic approach to mental health treatment and sees the conversation mainly focused on “how open or closed” the door to the hospital should be. Some efforts have given her hope, like King County’s Program of Assertive Community Treatment, coined the PACT program. The program, which Urs describes as a “hospital without walls,” is tailored toward people with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective bipolar disorder. Still, the program only scratches the surface.
“We don’t have nearly enough PACT teams in King County to meet the needs of the people in our community who are experiencing disorders of psychosis,” she added.
Mental toll on families
Any time it snows, Leone is always out searching for her son in Seattle, distributing food and supplies to other unhoused people during the process. When he calls from a borrowed cellphone or from jail, she begs him to call more to let her know he’s OK. If there’s time, she tries to convince him to go to a crisis care center. She said he feels trapped at treatment centers and has lost faith that medication will help.
Leone isn’t sure whether she would file another Joel’s Law petition again, but she hasn’t completely ruled it out. 
“The hope was that he would be able to obtain some relief from his symptoms and then be able to develop some appreciation for knowing what it felt like to not be suffering from those symptoms, and then building that rapport with him would help him be more receptive to staying in compliance with the treatment plan,” Leone said.
She understands why Joel’s Law is controversial. It’s something she has to grapple with frequently.
“They can’t just go around taking people’s rights away” or “involuntarily medicate people,” she said. 
Ultimately, she wishes they had better access to mental health services before it got to the point of using a Joel’s Law petition. Or, that there were court advocates available to help families navigate the Joel’s Law petition process.
She said each time they tried to get help — whether it was at the hospital or through a designated crisis responder or crisis care center — the relief was fleeting and the web of bureaucracy pushed her son further away. “He wanted the help, but he was also able to see that every time somebody was promising to help him, it was only hurting him,” she said.
It’s all taken a toll on Leone.
“I get a lot of ‘Just let it go. He’s choosing this. Just let it go. He likes this lifestyle. He’s choosing this lifestyle.’ And it’s infuriating because it’s like, no, he’s just as in need of help and support and unconditional love as anybody who has got some physically evident disability or impairment or illness.”
Anytime Leone is able to find her son on the streets of Seattle, he is always happy to see her and his little brother, Leone said. 
“He’ll open his coat, and he’ll bust out a Batman action figure, and he’ll be like, ‘I’ve been carrying this around for you.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tatiana-Leone-Portrait-01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-03-30 12:04:31.558324

(Photo by Dugan Meyer)Phoenix will be hosting a convention featuring President Donald Trump’s “border czar,” as well as hundreds of military and tech companies bidding for government border contracts, including a company involved in the torture in Abu Ghraib.
The Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center April 8 and 9 features panel discussions, as well as an expo floor where vendors can hawk their wares to government officials from around the world.
“It is just a big marketplace of companies — mostly tech companies — trying to sell things to the government,” Dave Maass, director of investigations for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the Arizona Mirror about the event. The EFF has previously catalogued the vendors who attend the annual conference, with a focus on technologies such as AI, infrared cameras and more.
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority after campaigning on immigration as a major issue. The administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and they have consistently tried to keep their mass deportation plans a secret.
The Mirror attempted to get press credentials to the Border Security Expo but was told that the event is closed to the press “this year.” The event website lists “media partners,” which include online pro-law enforcement trade publications like Border Security Report, Homeland Security Today and Officer.com. Homeland Security Today is run by a group of CEOs whose companies are on the expo floor.
The event will feature a number of high ranking officials from Customs and Border Patrol, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Drug Enforcement Agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The most high profile is Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan.
Homan served as the acting director of ICE in Trump’s first term. He backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups. Homan is scheduled to give the opening remarks at the event as part of a “State of the Border” discussion.
Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels will also speak at the event on a panel to give local perspectives to border issues.
While the event will feature a number of panel discussions and high profile speakers, it will also feature a litany of companies who will be aiming to impress government officials at the event in the hopes of securing a government contract or continuing an existing one.
The Mirror examined the list of companies set to be in attendance to highlight some of the key trends as well as noteworthy companies seeking the attention of the government officials.
The military industrial complex 
Many, if not most, of the vendors at the expo also serve the United States military and militaries overseas.
For example, Thales Defense and Security Inc. is a subsidiary of Thales Group, a French multinational aerospace and defense corporation. Its subsidiary has primarily done work on radio upgrades for the US Army and NATO forces and will be present on the expo floor.
When it comes to immigration and border enforcement, the company has supplied the systems the United States uses at ports of entry that involve biometric data. Other companies known for their large military contracts, such as BAE Systems, also will be present.
One particular military contracting company with a dark past also will have a booth on the expo floor. In November 2024, a jury found that Caci International shared liability with the U.S. Army for the torture of three Iraqi men at the Abu Graib prion in 2004, awarding the men $42 million.
The Virginia-based defense contractor has long gotten a number of contracts from the Department of Homeland Security.
Caci International is not the only government contractor with a controversial past.
Journalists at ProPublica recently exposed how private prison company GEO Group, an ICE contractor, has been refusing to pay detainees more than $1 a day for cleaning the governmental facilities at which they live. GEO Group’s stocks have skyrocketed under the Trump administration to $4 billion.
Another group with ties to Trump and a controversial backstory that will be present on the expo floor is Constellis, part of the private security company known as Triple Canopy.
Triple Canopy is a formation of what were once rival private security companies, Blackwater and Constellis. Guards from that company were spotted outside various federal agencies that were being taken over by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.
Also present will be Anduril Industries, which has ties to Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official.
Military grade equipment 
The expo floor will be full of vendors showing off their products which range from physical products like cameras and ground sensors to software that can be used to process data obtained by law enforcement.
Much of that equipment is also military grade.
Groups like ProTech Defense, Soal Marine Group and QuickSet Defense Technologies make military grade equipment that is marketed not just to federal agencies patrolling the border, but military customers.
Other tech is similar, often showcased being used by armed forces in online literature or described with military jargon.
Many of the surveillance camera platforms are similar or the same as those used on military aircraft, naval vessels or ground vehicles. Some firms, like Controp USA, boast about the capabilities of their surveillance platforms for both local law enforcement and military.
The militarization of police and border enforcement has long been a point of debate among privacy advocates, with research suggesting that law enforcement that has more access to military grade equipment are more likely to have violent encounters with the public.
Strongwatch will have a presence at the expo and it already has some of its tools in the hands of local Arizona law enforcement. The Phoenix Police Department has one of Strongwatch’s “Freedom on the Move” surveillance truck platforms, which are frequently deployed at parades and protests.
Anti/pro-drone
This year’s expo also features a number of companies focused on anti-drone technology, something local lawmakers and Attorney General Kris Mayes have been focused on lately, as well.
House Bill 2733 by Rep. David Marshall, R-Snowflake, would give local law enforcement immunity from liability for damage to personal property if they are shooting down a drone they believe is engaged in criminal activity.
The bill comes amid an increase in drug cartel drones flying over the states’ southern border, GOP lawmakers and Mayes say that local police should be able to shoot them out of the sky without fear they’ll be sued. A large number of tech companies at the expo this year are offering their own solutions to this problem.
Fortem Technologies has provided its counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems, a technical term for drones) equipment to Ukrainian forces, leading to it being sanctioned by Russia in response. The company has already been attracting interest from DHS, but other competitors have been vying for what appears to be a burgeoning market.
The Mirror found four other companies that will be on the expo floor selling anti-drone tech, with another that has sent one of its devices to frontline forces in Ukraine. But there are just as many companies, if not more, wanting to put eyes up in the sky as there are that want to remove them.
Aerial surveillance is a major strategy of CBP and DHS, who deploy aerial assets to the border daily to follow suspects or surveil areas where border crossers are known to frequent or smugglers are known to go.
A number of companies focused on different forms of aerial surveillance are also present at this year’s expo including multiple manufacturers of aerostats, a type of blimp. Recently, one of CBP’s blimps became untethered in Texas, leading to it flying miles away after being blown away by gusts of wind.
QinetiQ, the UK firm behind the Zephyr “pseudo satellite,” a high flying unmanned aircraft that can stay aloft for months at a time, will also be at the expo. Ascent AeroSystems, a subsidiary of Robinson Helicopters, will be at the expo and is currently promoting a new drone that it says is “advanced aerial surveillance in the palm of your hand.”
A number of new drone technologies appear to be on display at this year’s expo, including a hydrogen powered drone and a tethered drone as well.
AI and more 
Another trend this year is the promotion of artificial intelligence. Many of the companies tout the use of AI either to boost already existing programs or to be used in new ways.
One such company is Overland AI, which recently raised $32 million in funding. The company aims to create fully autonomous ground vehicles for the military and Overland is partnered with L3 Harris, one of the largest defense contractors in the world, who will also be present at the expo.
Other uses for AI are for surveillance gathering and analysis, such as with Australian-based FiveCast, which has previously signed contracts with DHS to use AI to look for open source intelligence threats.
Social media monitoring tools that have alarmed privacy advocates, like ShadowDragon, will also be present at the expo.
Other software companies that will be on the sales floor have faced controversy in the past.
One company, Perceptics, which has gotten contracts with the federal government for biometric data collection and automatic license plate reader collection, was part of the reason for a major breach in biometric data related to a facial recognition pilot program.
“A subcontractor working on this effort, Perceptics, LLC, transferred copies of CBP’s biometric data, such as traveler images, to its own company network. The subcontractor obtained access to this data between August 2018 and January 2019 without CBP’s authorization or knowledge. Later in 2019, DHS experienced a major privacy incident, as the subcontractor’s network was subjected to a malicious cyber attack,” the Office of the Inspector General wrote in a 2020 report.
Sponsors
While the event is closed to the press and largely to the public, those who can afford it can opt to pay $1,395 for the full conference. Those with government email or .edu email addresses can get in for free, and the expo offers a guide to those seeking to “justify” the event’s cost to their employer.
Akima, who got nearly a billion dollars in contracts with the United States Space Force last year, is the expo’s top sponsor. However, under the “Supporting Organizations” banner of the event are some more notable organizations.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a conservative think tank whose members have been promoted by Trump in the previous administration and have denied climate change, pushed school vouchers and received funding from both the GEO Group and Koch Industries.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation was also on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Project 2025 is a collection of right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power under the Trump administration. The list of policy plans was largely created by former Trump aides and allies.
Another “supporting organization” is the Border Patrol Foundation, whose president in 2018 garnered controversy for defending the use of pepper spray on migrants at the border by saying that a person could put it on nachos and eat it. That man, Ron Colburn, is on the advisory board for the expo.

Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are ringing alarm bells over congressional Republicans’ proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding, which could especially hurt older Americans. (Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)Dr. Fred Levin has been watching with growing alarm the national debate around federal cuts to Medicaid. He’s responsible for the medical care of about 100 older adults at the Community PACE center in rural Newaygo, Michigan. For his patients, Medicaid isn’t just a safety net — it’s a matter of life or death.
“If left to see to their own needs, a lot of them would stay in their homes and would slowly die,” he said. “They wouldn’t be able to get to their doctors’ appointments unless they had a family member to help. They wouldn’t get social care. They wouldn’t have people coming into their homes and seeing the bed bugs or the lice in their hair. They wouldn’t get their medications.”
The care at Community PACE is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities, and Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. The center is a one-stop shop that provides medical and social services to older adults during the day, allowing them to continue living safely in their homes.
If Congress cuts funding to Medicaid, Levin expects his center would probably close. Unlike traditional nursing home care, which state Medicaid programs are required by federal law to cover, the services at PACE centers like his are an optional benefit that 33 states have opted to cover.
Around the nation, doctors, lawmakers, advocates and patients are watching anxiously as Republicans in Congress consider proposals to slash billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in proposed tax cuts. The specific nature of the funding cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states.










If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved.


– Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy, Justice in Aging


The additional financial burden could blow billion-dollar holes in state budgets, forcing state lawmakers to slash health benefits or restrict who’s eligible for them. Nearly a fifth of Americans rely on Medicaid, and the percentage is even higher in some states.
“There are a lot of people who don’t pay attention to this because they think it doesn’t affect them personally,” Levin said. “But 1 in 4 people in Michigan are on Medicaid. It’s very likely you have friends or family on Medicaid.”
Nearly all Americans over age 65 are covered by Medicare, which Republicans have pledged not to touch. Medicare doesn’t cover most nursing home or other long-term care, however. Neither does most private insurance.
But Medicaid does.
“If you have an older adult in your life who has been in a nursing home or received help at home with cooking, bathing, dressing, chances are Medicaid was involved,” said Natalie Kean, director of federal health advocacy for Justice in Aging, an advocacy group focused on addressing poverty among older people.
“Many of us have a connection to the program or will one day,” she said.
 A divided front

Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But policy experts say that reducing coverage for some Medicaid recipients, such as the working adults who got coverage under expansion programs, will have ripple effects on vulnerable groups such as children and older adults.
Republicans aren’t united in a desire to see massive cuts.
Last month, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican governor in a purple state, publicly called on Congress not to slash Medicaid funding.
Earlier this week, Washington Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier wrote a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider cuts to Medicaid and expressing her concern about the large number of military retirees and senior citizens in her district.
Caldier, a dentist who has worked with nursing home patients, told Stateline she believes the most likely cuts would be a reduction in the amount the federal government matches state spending for working adults who are covered under Medicaid expansion. That, she said, would have little impact on older adults.
“The only caveat is that I am very worried that the leadership in our state does not have a good relationship with our president,” Caldier said. Democrats control the offices of governor and both legislative chambers in Washington state. Caldier worries that if Washington lawmakers defy the president over issues such as gender-affirming care for transgender youth, the feds could retaliate by slashing their Medicaid payments to the state.
“If we got into a political match with the president, we would lose, no matter how you slice or dice it,” she said.
In Idaho, Republican state lawmakers shot down a bill that likely would have repealed Medicaid expansion, before passing one that will introduce sweeping policy changes in an effort to control costs.
Even in Congress, some Republicans are balking, publicly defending Medicaid and warning about the consequences of deep cuts. Some who have high percentages of Medicaid recipients in their districts have urged party leaders not to cut funding for the program and have vowed to vote against any budget plan that does so.
Medicaid covers 72 million Americans. A majority of American adults, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they want Congress to either maintain current Medicaid spending or increase it, according to a February 2025 poll from KFF, a health policy research group.
President Donald Trump has said in recent months that he won’t touch Medicaid. But last month, U.S. House Republicans pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that calls for about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help counterbalance the Trump administration’s desired $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.
Facing cuts that large, states would have to figure out which benefits to chop in order to keep their budgets balanced, which is a constitutional requirement in most states.
Older adults and people with disabilities already account for more than half of states’ Medicaid spending, on average. In some states, including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and North Dakota, those groups account for two-thirds of state Medicaid spending.
Idaho state Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Democrat on the state Senate Health & Welfare committee, said her biggest concern is Congress reducing the federal match rate. This is the amount of money the federal government chips in to help states pay for Medicaid. How much a state receives mainly depends on how wealthy its residents are. Richer states such as California and Connecticut get less help, while poorer states get more.
In Idaho, on the poorer end of the spectrum, the feds pay about 67% of traditional Medicaid costs and 90% of Medicaid expansion costs.
“It is all a domino effect,” Wintrow said. The federal government covers about $3 billion of Idaho’s $4.2 billion Medicaid budget. “If the feds start chopping that off, it’s going to impact everything.”
 Cutting care at home

All state Medicaid programs have opted to cover at least some home-based and community care, such as home health aides who assist people with bathing, toileting and other daily living activities, transportation and adult day care.
Kean and other experts worry that because federal law doesn’t require state Medicaid programs to cover home-based care, state lawmakers might sharply reduce spending on those services — or even eliminate coverage.
“When states have budget shortfalls, they start to tighten eligibility for the home-based programs,” said Kean. “We’re certain those would be the first to go if federal funding is cut for Medicaid.”
Paying for home-based services out of pocket would exhaust the median Medicare recipient’s savings in less than two years, according to KFF.
The median cost of a year of a full-time aide to help is about $62,400, far above the median income for Americans over 65, which is about $36,000. The median life savings for Medicare beneficiaries was $103,800 in 2023.
Home-based services are a popular benefit for state Medicaid programs, because most enrollees prefer to remain in their homes. And despite the expense, home care can be more cost effective than nursing homes — about $38,000 vs. nearly $54,000 per year in 2021, according to a KFF analysis.
Cutting Medicaid also could make it harder to recruit and keep a workforce of nursing home and home health employees.
Over the past two years, most states — even those led by Republicans — increased their Medicaid payment rates for those services, in an effort to combat the nationwide shortage of long-term care workers.
But federal funding cuts could jeopardize what states are able to pay those workers.
“There’s already a direct-care workforce crisis,” Kean said. “Even if eligibility isn’t directly cut or programs aren’t cut, there wouldn’t be enough workers to provide that care. At home and in nursing facilities, the quality of care will go down.”
In rural Michigan, Levin said the PACE center where he works employs about 100 people. Its closure would impact not only those workers, but also would mean his patients would be left to find transportation and other health services on their own, even if those services are still covered by Medicaid.
“Without access in rural areas, how are these individuals going to get to the bigger cities where they can get to their health care? It’s going to overwhelm other parts of the health care system,” Levin said.
“Everybody’s going to be responsible for taking care of the people who don’t have health insurance, in some indirect way or another. It’s going to affect us all.”

American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are fighting for equal governance and sovereignty over their own health data. (Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
For Indian Country, federal cuts decimate core tribal programs

Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”
Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.

I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



On Tuesday, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

Brian Evans echoed those sentiments Friday, noting that Monday and Tuesday will likely be heavy bill filing days because waiting to file beyond that will make it really difficult for legislation to make it all the way through the process. Many bills already have been delayed due to drafting, amendments and last-minute changes, as well as waiting on fiscal impact statements, according to Evans, who said he wasn’t aware of any urgent or controversial bills that have yet to be filed. 
The Cabot Republican said he’s been speaking with House committee chairs about how to clear their calendars and ensure bills that will be heard are placed on the active agenda. The latter is important for transparency and ensuring constituents have time to make arrangements to speak for or against legislation, he said.

In addition to finalizing the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget, the Legislature is expected to consider some of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ policy priorities for the session that have not yet become law.
Two such bills are sponsored by Hester: Senate Bill 377, which would eliminate the state’s 0.125% grocery sales tax, and Senate Bill 426, the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act. The latter would mandate that Arkansas law enforcement agencies participate in a federal program that deputizes them to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
Hester said he hopes to present SB 426 for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. SB 377 is on Monday’s Senate Revenue and Tax Committee agenda.
Regulating minors’ access to cellphones and social media has also been a priority for Sanders. Two bills modeled after federal legislation passed the House with bipartisan support this month: House Bill 1717 is the Arkansas Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, and House Bill 1726 is the Arkansas Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).

Senate committees will make time to consider both bills even if special orders of business are necessary, Hester said. A special order of business compels consideration before other items on a committee agenda. 
Sanders said in January, during her State of the State address, that the Legislature should amend the Social Media Safety Act of 2023 “so that it’s no longer held up in court and can begin to be enforced.” The enjoined law would have been the first in the nation to require minors to receive parental permission before signing up for a social media account.
So far no such amendments to the law have been proposed, but Hester said he expects it to “happen one way or another” since the governor said it is important to her.
“It may be something we don’t have to handle because it’s getting handled in other ways,” Hester said. “Maybe we’re confident that we’re going to end up winning in court. Maybe we’re confident that… President [Donald] Trump’s executive orders will handle it or something that they’re doing on the federal level.”
Compensation, prisons and China
The Senate is set to take up a proposed revamp of the state employee pay plan Monday, which passed the Joint Budget Committee on March 20. Sanders announced the plan in November and said it should make most state employees’ salaries competitive with the private sector and improve recruitment and retention.

Arkansas lawmakers advance $750 million appropriation bill for prison construction

 

The pay plan has not been controversial, unlike Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres the state purchased in Franklin County. Earlier this month, the Joint Budget Committee approved a $750 million appropriation for the project, which has sparked frustration from some lawmakers and Franklin County residents.
Evans said he anticipates the prison appropriation legislation, Senate Bill 354, will continue generating discussion and could take a couple of tries to meet the required vote threshold in the House. Most bills need a simple majority of lawmakers’ support to pass, but budget-related bills need three-fourths of the support of each chamber, or 76 House votes and 27 Senate votes.
“When you’re talking about 100 members, it’s a lot of different opinions, a lot of different ideas, last-minute questions that come up,” he said. “Maybe there’ll be some folks not vote for it the first time just so that they get some extra time, make sure they have all their questions answered.”
Hester said he expects the bill to come before the full Senate on Tuesday. He said he could not predict how the Senate will vote; there is no limit on how many votes an appropriation bill receives before it reaches the three-fourths vote threshold.
Sanders urged passage of the appropriation in an Arkansas Democrat-Gazette op-ed Friday and called on state lawmakers to “[r]eject the tired excuses of politicians who don’t want criminals behind bars. Fund the prison, public safety, and a better future for all Arkansans.”
Sanders has also expressed support for a package of bills that will ban certain interactions between state entities and the Chinese government. She and other Republicans have criticized China’s activities in the state, including its past ownership of farmland in Craighead County.
Only one of the six bills has been signed into law and the rest are at various stages of the legislative process, but Hester said there is “nothing more popular with constituents than pushing back on China and what they’re doing to us.”

Constitutional amendments and education
Prior to last week’s recess, the House State Agencies Committee spent three weeks considering 20 proposed constitutional amendments. Evans anticipates the committee will begin ranking the proposals this week and likely send the top five to the House for further consideration. The Senate has 24 proposals to consider.
The Arkansas Legislature can refer three proposed constitutional amendments to voters during a legislation session, with each chamber generally selecting one and jointly selecting a third, Evans said. However, it’s not a requirement that lawmakers always refer three amendments, he said. 
“I think it’s really, really important to understand that just because we can do three, does not mean that we have to do three,” he said. “But also with the understanding that if we are going to present something forward, refer something out to the public to vote, I think it needs to be something that is really important statewide.”
Also this week, Evans said he anticipates Rep. Keith Brooks, a Little Rock Republican who succeeded him as chair of the House Education Committee this year, will run the biannual public school funding bill, which dictates per-student funding. House Bill 1312 was expected to be considered prior to the break, but was held up because it was awaiting a fiscal impact statement, Evans said. Fiscal impact statements explain how much money a bill would cost to implement, and they are compiled by either the Bureau of Legislative Research or the Department of Finance and Administration.
The per-pupil funding amount for the current school year is $7,771. If lawmakers approve HB 1312, the amount would increase to $8,162 for the 2025-2026 school year and $8,371 for the following academic year. 
New bill would dissolve Arkansas State Library and its board, set new library funding criteria

Overall, the session has been “very smooth,” according to Evans, who said he’s noticed “a different feel, a camaraderie in the House” when it comes to “good policy for all Arkansans.”
“Where things tend to get difficult is when you start looking at policy that’s more culture-driven,” he said. “So while we’ve had a few of those things that have crept up this session, there hasn’t seemed to have been as many. And so the body has really been able to just focus more on policy and members representing their districts, and how that policy’s going to affect their district rather than the culture of the district.” 
One such “culture-driven” bill is Senate Bill 536, which Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, filed March 20. It would dissolve the Arkansas State Library and its board after the board did not take what Sullivan said were appropriate actions to keep “age-inappropriate” materials away from minors.
Hester supports SB 536 and has expressed support for Sullivan’s past promises to abolish the library board, which has repeatedly refused to divest from the American Library Association and to withhold funding from libraries where “sexually explicit” materials are within children’s reach.
“I don’t know how clear we could have been with the library board that they need to take stances to not provide pornography to kids, and they are insistent on it,” Hester said Friday.
The General Assembly resumes its work Monday morning. Meeting schedules, agendas and livestreams are available on the Arkansas Legislature’s website.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)This is Kansas.
Imagine. It’s late at night and you’re fiddling with the tuning dial of an old shortwave radio that’s been in your garage since your eccentric old uncle died and left you a pile of his favorite stuff. You haven’t given much thought to any of it for years, but then one of your neighbors disappeared last month, hustled away by masked individuals with badges and thrown into an unmarked black SUV.
Today is the sixty-ninth day of…
The signal begins to fade, then is lost in the static. Bathed in the glow of the tuning dial, you lean close and turn the knob ever so slightly until the voice of the announcer returns. She speaks well, confident and knowing, and you can almost see her expression as she continues.
We’re broadcasting tonight from — well, we can’t say exactly where, but we can tell you we were in Council Grove last night and Garden City the night before that. 
It’s a bright night in April under a full moon, but you take comfort in the dark of the garage, which smells of grease and ozone from the big transformer in the back of the old radio receiver. It took you a week to figure out how to hang the wire antenna beneath your eaves so you could pick up a broadcast and another night or two to learn how to tune a signal. It all was so strangely analog, but luckily your uncle left you some books about how to do it.
We don’t know where we’ll be tomorrow.
The rumor on the block was that your neighbor was a terrorist, but you hadn’t seen anything to support that. Sure, she had some outspoken opinions about American foreign policy in the Middle East, but she also had had a good job and a family here. You worried about her kids. When you called the regional ICE detention center, run by a private prison, you were told coldly the detainee was no longer in U.S. custody. You asked if that meant she was no longer in the country. There was a pause, and then the voice on the other end of the line asked for your name.
We are here to tell you the news. The news may be good or bad, but we will always tell you the truth. Topping the news is that several hundred American deportees remain in foreign jails, expelled from this country and charged with no crime other than dissent. At least 40 of those individuals are Kansans. A prayer vigil was held at the Capitol Building rotunda in Topeka for the release of the unnamed deportees, but the interfaith gathering was disrupted by authorities citing new policies that make such protests illegal. 
You’ve never paid much attention to the regular news, preferring to get your information from podcasts that make you laugh. Newspapers are dead, magazines seem as old-fashioned as Christmas catalogs, and you haven’t read a book since you were forced to in high school. Television? Who watches fake news when there’s social media. Things that others say they care about — equality, progress, democracy — are just words. You didn’t vote in the presidential election last year because you couldn’t relate to either of the major party candidates. One was a clownish old man and the other was like that teacher in government class during senior year who made you feel guilty because you didn’t know the Bill of Rights.
In world news, NATO alliance helicopters are attempting to airlift the last resistance fighters from Kiev as the fall of the Ukrainian capital to advancing Russian forces appears imminent. A war predicted to last three days when it began in 2022 has lasted more than three years. The turning point was when the United States suspended military assistance in March 2025, the U.S. later withdrew from NATO, and Russia broke the resolve of Ukrainian and European defenders by threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons. There is no word on the fate of the Ukrainian president, who vowed never to abandon the capital. 
Lately you’ve discovered that it’s more difficult to find on your devices information you used to take for granted: how to file your taxes, how fast the measles outbreak is moving in southwestern Kansas, what the local weather’s going to be for the rest of the week. You’ve also become irritated by the ads showing up on your social media feeds, from the “one weird trick” to getting rich in crypto to the constant appeals for seven “supernatural blessings” for just $1,000.
Now to finances. The global tariff war continues, with Americans paying substantially higher prices for consumer goods ranging from Scotch whisky to imported cars and automobile parts. The average price of a new car is now $49,000, which for a typical family means a monthly payment of up to $1,000, not counting the cost of gas, taxes or insurance.
Worried about your neighbor, you went to your local newspaper office, believing the reporters there might be able to help, but discovered the door to the building was locked and a sign said it had ceased publication. You sort of remember that a local police department had raided a newspaper office somewhere in Kansas not so long ago, but you can’t recall the details. Your parents had always subscribed to the town paper, but it had never occurred to you because news was something you could get on the internet for free.
Where to go now? The nearest television station, the one that had not yet had its operating license revoked, was in Topeka. There used to be a local radio station here, but it went off the air years ago, after refusing to be bought up by a chain. The NPR station broadcasting from the local university was taken off the air a few weeks ago because some lawmakers called it “un-American,” followed by the  closing of most of the campus when the school lost its federal grants for promoting diversity and improper ideology.
Closer to home, Canadian armed forces conducted war games along the 49th Parallel, meant as a show of strength against continued threats from the American president to annex our northern neighbor as the 51st state. While long considered an absurd idea, the threats were taken seriously after American troops last week seized Greenland, declared it a U.S. territory, and gave its 57,000 citizens just five days to renounce their Danish citizenship or face deportation. The Folketing, the Danish parliament, has appealed for defense under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.
Wary of going to the police or other authorities for help, you went to the public library and were directed to an old-fashioned bulletin board where names, photos, and details of the missing were thumbtacked. There were a dozen from your town alone, fathers and mothers and students. Your neighbor wasn’t among them, so you took an index card from a nearby stack and wrote her name and description and added it to the others. You wished you had a photo, but you didn’t. Perhaps somebody else, her family or one of her friends, would add it. On your way out of the building, a librarian wearing a rainbow button on their sweater vest stopped and asked if you had a library card.
“Here,” they had said, and pressed a slip of paper into your hand. “Take it with you.”
But it wasn’t an application for a library card. It was a handwritten note:
“Radio Free Kansas, 10 p.m. nightly, 4960 MHz AM.”
Let us now recall the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who in September 1939 told the American people this: “For four long years a succession of actual wars and constant crises have shaken the entire world and have threatened in each case to bring on the gigantic conflict which is today unhappily a fact. … You are, I believe, the best informed and most enlightened people in all the world at this moment. … At the same time, as I told my press conference today, it is of the highest importance that the press and the radio use the utmost caution to discriminate between actual verified fact on the one hand, and mere rumor on the other.”
You stare at the glowing dial of the shortwave receiver as if it were the secret to decoding a mystery. What historical event happened in September 1939? You had this in history class. What was the significance of the date? Ah, Germany invades Poland. It marks the start of World War II in Europe.
Now, for our final segment, we rebroadcast something from Voice of America, disbanded in March 2025. The new chief responsible for VOA and Radio Free Europe and other broadcast initiatives had accused the agency of harboring spies and terrorist sympathizers, of widespread corruption, and of spending hundreds of millions on fake news. But the real issue with VOA is that it brought the world the truth, good or bad. This segment is about the monarch butterfly migration in Kansas, a journey that takes the colorful migrants from Mexico to Canada. It is from the VOA Learning English Broadcast of three years ago:
“The migrating monarch butterfly is considered an endangered species. Scientists say the dropping numbers of monarchs are due to climate change, loss of habitat and the use of pesticides — chemicals that kill insects — and herbicides — chemicals that kill plants. But there are things that people living in the United States can do to help the beloved black-and-orange insects.”
You think about all the butterflies that fluttered through your back yard this time of year when you were a kid. You think of all of them you caught in a net, all the ones you accidentally crushed, the ones you put in a mason jar and then forgot about. You get tearful, wishing you had urged your parents to plant milkweed.
We hope to see you here again tomorrow night. Stay safe. Ad astra! This is Radio Free Kansas signing off.
A few tinny bars of “Home on the Range” follow.
Then silence.

Weisman and Reporter Alexander Castro. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Current took the region’s top award for local election coverage by an online news outlet, and Senior Reporter Nancy Lavin received two first place awards in the annual New England Better Newspaper Competition on Saturday night.
The morning newsletter Swell earned third place in the outstanding newsletter category among online news sites at the New England Newspaper Convention held at the Portland Regency Hotel & Spa in Portland, Maine.
The competition held by the New England Newspaper & Press Association is a chance for the region’s news outlets to showcase the best efforts of their teams and share their achievements with readers. Work published between Aug. 1 2023, and July 31, 2024, was eligible.
Rhode Island Current staff received a first place award for their work covering the November 2023 special election to fill the open 1st Congressional District seat, which was won by U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo. 
A total of 35 candidates turned in paperwork declaring their intention to run, but only 15 collected the minimum 500 validated and certified signatures from voters to run in the September primary. Thirteen candidates were Democrats, including the early frontrunner, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, whose campaign was ultimately derailed by a signature scandal involving her nomination forms.
Rhode Island Current’s election coverage also looked at what shapes this congressional district made up of 19 communities. While the Democratic race drew most of the attention, the team’s coverage included why the two Republican primary candidates stayed quiet. A Primary Day blog was active with regular updates on the candidates as the team fanned out to cover the campaigns and the results that night.
Lavin won a first place award for Business/Economic reporting for her investigative profile of a solar panel company CEO accused of predatory sales tactics. Lavin outlined the loosely regulated legal and business environment that allowed the company to flourish before being sued by the Office of Attorney General and laying off a third of its staff.
An in-depth story on a small but contentious oyster farm project proposed for Tiverton’s Sapowet Cove won Lavin another first place award. Lavin examined how the proposed project illuminated the curious alliances and growing discontent surrounding Rhode Island’s aquaculture industry more broadly.

(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)In a stunning rejection of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, Louisiana voters turned down all four of his constitutional amendments Saturday, including the governor’s plan to overhaul the state’s tax and budget laws. 
With votes still being counted, nearly two-thirds of voters had refused all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s term. 
The governor, who has sometimes relied on strong-arm tactics to get his agenda through the Louisiana Legislature, could become more vulnerable to pushback after failing to pass his most ambitious policy proposal at the ballot box. 
Landry’s priority for the election, Amendment 2, would have lowered the maximum income tax rate the state could enact and limit annual state budget increases. It also would have made it more difficult to enact new tax breaks.
The proposal was expected to produce a financial windfall for Landry and state legislators later this year. Amendment 2 would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily. 
Landry had attempted to sweeten voters on Amendment 2 by tying it to compensation for public school teachers. Had it passed, temporary stipends worth $2,000 and $1,000 that teachers and school support staff have received for the past two years were expected to become permanent. 

Now, the educators are at risk of a pay cut since Landry hasn’t included money for their stipend in his current budget proposal. 
Opponents of Amendment 2 celebrated its defeat Saturday night. They include William Most, an attorney who unsuccessfully sued to have the proposal removed from the ballot. He has argued that the language put before voters was convoluted and misleading, making it illegal.
“I think this is a full-throated rejection of attempts to trick Louisiana voters into voting for something they don’t want,” Most said. “… This sends a clear message that if state officials want to change our constitution, they can’t do it through trickery or deceit.”

Landry and the Republican-dominated legislature might have inadvertently stirred up public opposition to Amendment 2 by putting it on the same ballot as Amendment 3, a juvenile justice measure that drew the ire of Democrats and national anti-incarceration groups. 
Amendment 3, which 65% of voters opposed, would have made it easier to send more minors to adult jails and prisons for longer sentences. It spurred national criminal justice reform organizations, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and Vera Institute of Justice, to spend more than $500,000 to turn voters against it. 

While those organizations focused on defeating Amendment 3, they also became the backbone of a “No on All” campaign working to vote down all four of the constitutional amendments Landry was pushing. 
Supporters of the tax proposal in Amendment 2 said they believed the criminal justice issue had a negative effect on their measure in interviews earlier this week. 

“[Amendment 3] is a huge motivation of the groups that are saying no to everything. That seems to be the motivating factor,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute, a conservative think tank who helped push the tax and budget amendment. 
Landry’s team started to see trouble during the early voting period for the election. John Couvillon, an experienced Louisiana pollster, said Democrats and Black voters showed up in far greater numbers than Republicans during the early voting period. 

“I have just never seen an early vote this strong [for Democrats],” Couvillon said. 
In addition to Amendment 3, Couvillon said left-leaning voters may also be motivated to vote because of concerns about President Donald Trump. Landry is closely aligned with the Trump administration. 
However, opposition to Amendment 2, and the budget and tax changes, also came from some conservative activists. Religious groups and nonprofits were unhappy the amendment would have weakened constitutional protections for property tax exemptions they enjoy. 

Woody Jenkins, chairman of the East Baton Rouge Republican Party and a former state representative, was among those who opposed the amendment. 
The defeat of Amendments 2 and 3 also likely led to the downfall of Amendment 1, which failed with 64% of voters against the proposal. It would have allowed the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana with jurisdiction outside current parish and judicial districts. 
Amendment 4 also failed, with 62% of voters. It would have adjusted the rules for special elections to fill vacant or new judgeships, primarily on the Louisiana Supreme Court.

(Washington State Department of Transportation)A divided Washington state Senate on Saturday approved a hike in the state’s gas tax and a two-year budget that hinges on billions of dollars from new taxes on the state’s wealthiest residents and largest companies.
The Senate, on a 31-18 vote, endorsed raising the tax 6 cents per gallon on July 1 and increasing it 2% annually to account for inflation starting the following year.
It is the anchor of a barge full of new and higher taxes and fees that will generate around $500 million a year for transportation from users of cars, boats, planes, electric bikes and ferries. Those dollars will ensure the state can complete projects underway and do ones that have been long promised to residents.
“We are billions of dollars behind in maintenance and preservation. We have a ferry system that is in shambles. We have citizens dying at a record pace on our roads,” said Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, the lead Republican on the Senate Transportation Committee who helped craft the package. “We had to respond, and that’s what we did.”
Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the transportation committee and the chamber’s lead transportation budget writer, said the revenue “will unlock investments in every corner of the state. It will fill potholes and fix bridges in urban communities and in rural communities, and it will keep promises that we have made.”
An even bigger challenge
Also Saturday, the Senate passed the Democrats’ two-year $78.5 billion operating budget on a 28-21 vote. Democrat Sens. Mike Chapman of Port Angeles and Deb Krishnadasan of Gig Harbor joined Republicans in opposition. 
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and lead budget writer, said a looming budget shortfall resulted in some hard choices, such as delaying expansions of early learning programs, furloughing state workers, and draining the state’s reserves. But she noted the budget boosts funding for special education and preserves critical public services.
“The core of this budget is a commitment to the people of Washington,” she said.
It spends about $5.4 billion more than the current budget. Of the increase, $1.6 billion is for education and new collective bargaining agreements for state workers. The rest is to cover increased expenses for existing programs and services, also known as maintenance-level spending.
Robinson said it shaves around $3 billion in spending in the next budget, and $6.5 billion over four fiscal years. Slashing deeper would have been “devastating,” she said.
“None of these choices was made lightly,” Robinson said of the cuts. “That is why this budget bill pairs reductions with smart, necessary and progressive revenue options. This balance of cuts and new revenue allows us to protect services and stay fiscally responsible for years to come.”
The two-year Senate budget relies on roughly $6.2 billion from a four-year, $17 billion package of tax changes that did not get voted on.
Those include lifting the cap on annual property tax growth along with new taxes on the assets of wealthy individuals and the payrolls of large companies. Hearings on the proposed tax legislation will be held Monday in the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the lead budget writer for Senate Republicans, said the alternative budget he wrote would have spent $75.3 billion and been balanced without new taxes.
“We can do it without all the drastic cuts that people have been talking about. We can do it without any of the harmful taxes,” he said.
He criticized Democrats’ draining of the emergency reserves, saying it puts the state in a precarious fiscal position in a period of uncertainty over how decisions by the federal government might impact the state. And he said the document was confusing because it spends money to fund state worker pay raises and then seeks to save dollars by furloughing them for up to 13 days.
The House is slated to vote on its proposed budget Monday. Like the Senate, it counts on money from that chamber’s $14.8 billion tax package that has not yet been acted on. If passed, negotiations will begin in earnest to reconcile differences in the two spending approaches.
In the meantime, House and Senate budget writers will need to work with Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, who has said he wants all cost-cutting options explored before considering any new taxes. 
‘Everybody is being asked to contribute’
The current two-year state transportation budget is $14.6 billion and includes money for road maintenance, ferries, bike and pedestrian projects and more. 
The budget blueprint passed by the Senate on Saturday lays out $16.2 billion in spending in the next biennium, made up of $6.2 billion in operating costs and $10 billion for capital projects.
The plethora of new taxes and fee increases is projected to bring in $3 billion in the next six years, of which a little less than a third would be available in the next budget. 
In the floor debate, Liias said they faced a $1 billion shortfall in the next budget, growing to $4 billion to meet current obligations over the next six years. 
To address it, the Senate came up with the revenue plan. It also shifts $5 billion of future expenses tied to replacing culverts to the state’s capital budget. Details on that move will be released Monday morning. And the Senate is directing 0.3% of sales tax collections from the operating budget to transportation starting in the 2027-2029 biennium.
Absent these moves, the Legislature would have been forced to halt some undertakings and postpone “every single improvement project that is not currently under contract,” Liias said Saturday.
The revenue package is intended to spread the burden across all users of the transportation system.
“It’s not the folks who drive a car are going to pay more or folks who bike are going to pay more,” Liias said. “Everybody is being asked to contribute more to the infrastructure that we all depend on.”
Fares could rise 1.5% each year on Washington State Ferries and a new surcharge would be added for credit card transactions. Tolls could be collected on the entire Highway 520 corridor instead of just the floating bridge. Police could issue $150 tickets for cars parked with expired tabs in the public right-of-way.
There’s a new 10% luxury tax on motor homes, recreational watercraft, and non-commercial aircraft costing over $500,000. The tax would be levied only on the amount of the sale, lease, or transfer value exceeding $500,000.
Other measures include raising registration fees on electric vehicles and hybrids, increasing the tax on rental cars and adding a $10 assessment on traffic infractions starting Jan. 1, 2026. 
And there could be a new $1 fee tacked onto tickets for sporting events and concerts with a crowd of more than 20,000 people. The assessment would be levied on the operators of venues with a capacity of more than 20,000 attendees, such as T-Mobile Park, Lumen Field and the Tacoma Dome.
Sen. Leonard Christian, R-Spokane, opposed the gas tax increase, saying his constituents will drive to Idaho to pay less to fill up and spend on other items while there.
“This is going to be another boon for Idaho,” he said.
In its final action Saturday, the Senate voted 35-14 to pass a bill to issue up to $7 billion of bonds to pay for the design, right-of-way purchases and construction of highway projects. Senate Bill 5800 also increased the bonding authorization for the State Route 520 project by $500 million.
Meanwhile, the House is expected to vote on its transportation budget next week. And it has a bill to raise the state gas tax 9 cents, and then index it to inflation.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As some lawmakers complain about the amount of money influencing ballot measures in South Dakota, new numbers indicate that 2024’s ballot question campaigns were among the most expensive in state history.
Ballot question committees recently filed their year-end campaign finance reports. Those and earlier reports show the total amount spent to support and oppose the seven measures in last fall’s election was about $12 million. There are no limits on contributions to ballot question committees.
South Dakota’s campaign finance system makes compiling and comparing campaign finance data difficult. Rather than entering information directly into a centralized system, candidates, committees and independent spenders submit scanned forms to the South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office that have to be viewed one-by-one, which is what South Dakota Searchlight did to compile its analysis.


 Only the state’s 2006 and 2016 elections had more expensive ballot question campaigns, reaching nearly $13 million each of those years, according to historical data maintained by the national nonprofit Open Secrets.
Republican legislators cited last year’s spending as part of their motivation to file bills this year that would tighten restrictions on citizen-initiated ballot measures. 
One major bill that passed will move the deadline for submitting petition signatures from May to February, shortening the petition-gathering window by three months. Gov. Larry Rhoden vetoed a bill that would require constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in every state Senate district, and legislators will consider that veto on Monday. Legislators put a measure on the 2026 ballot that will ask voters to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%.
Governor vetoes effort to restrict constitutional amendment process with geographic rule

Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, sponsor of the 60% proposal, said during the legislative session that last year’s ballot measures resulted in “millions of dollars in out-of-state money coming for deceptive, emotionally charged ads stating half-truths.”
Open Secrets reports that about 70% of the money contributed to last year’s South Dakota ballot measures came from South Dakota residents.
Last year’s most expensive ballot measure campaign in the state appears to have been Amendment G, an abortion-rights measure that voters rejected. 
It’s difficult to determine exactly how much was spent in the Amendment G campaign, because the main group supporting the amendment, Dakotans for Health, also supported another unsuccessful ballot question that would have repealed sales taxes on groceries. Dakotans for Health spent a combined $1.32 million on those campaigns and did not separate expenses in its reports.
Opponents spent $2.74 million against the abortion-rights measure.
The grocery tax measure was Initiated Measure 28. Besides the amount spent to support it by Dakotans for Health, groups spent about $240,000 against it. 
Another big-dollar campaign was Referred Law 21, a set of carbon dioxide pipeline regulations that voters rejected. Spending totaled $3.15 million, with $2.87 million by supporters and $275,000 by opponents. The majority of funds in support of the measure came from ethanol producers hoping to build a multi-state pipeline to capture and sequester carbon emitted by their production plants. 
An unsuccessful effort to legalize recreational marijuana use, Initiated Measure 29, was nearly a $2 million campaign with $1.4 million in spending by supporters and about $468,000 by opponents.
Constitutional Amendment F, which legislators sent to the ballot and voters approved, authorized the state to consider imposing work requirements on people eligible for expanded Medicaid benefits. All $587,000 of spending on the amendment was by the no side.
Amendment H, which would have established open primary elections but was rejected by voters, was a $1.95 million campaign with most of that amount spent by supporters.

(Courtesy of Phil Larkin)Selling, exchanging or transferring Washington State Department of Natural Resources land is serious business. These decisions have long-term implications and require comprehensive information and thorough review of all potential options and should not be rushed.
It appears that the Jan. 7 decision by the Board of Natural Resources agreeing to sell the 200-acre Thorpe Property in Spokane’s Latah Valley in exchange for a Bellingham property fell short of that standard. New information raises questions about whether the board had all the information it needed to make the best decision.
I should know because I served on Washington’s Board of Natural Resources for eight years, and thus am very familiar with the process, motivation, and history surrounding DNR’s land sales and exchanges. Never during my tenure on the board do I recall any land sale or swap that was expedited in a manner similar to this exchange. The process lacked transparency, failed to engage important stakeholders, and ignored a viable alternative to achieve the agency’s goals.
Since 1957, the board has set policies to guide how our state’s trust lands are managed, including approving the sustainable harvest of timber sales and the sale or exchanges of trust lands while meeting a constitutional obligation to act in the best interest of the trust beneficiaries for which those lands are managed (e.g., K-12 schools, higher education, roads, fire departments, hospitals, and other county services). 
DNR manages trust lands to provide jobs, commodities, clean water, wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities while maintaining the primary goal of trust revenue production.
The January decision agreed to sell off the Thorpe Property (valued at $8.4 million) to a development company in addition to paying $7 million in exchange for a property currently housing a Haggen grocery store in Bellingham that the agency has stated has a value of $15.4 million.  At first blush, it would seem those numbers add up, except that a look at the Whatcom County assessor’s valuation of the Bellingham property comes in at $11.4 million.
Commercial real estate can be a risky business these days, as any of us can tell by the number of vacant storefronts in our cities and towns since the pandemic. Add to this that the grocery store in question was one of the stores put on a list for divestiture as part of the recent Kroger-Albertsons merger. Large companies put underperforming stores on such lists before they can gain additional stores in a merger.
What makes this agreement even more puzzling is that the board ignored that DNR had already approved a trust land transfer option that would have transferred the Thorpe Property to the city of Spokane to create a city park and community and education center for residents in the Latah Valley. This would be a much simpler approach and allow the Legislature to compensate the trust for transferring the land with $8.4 million, which would be used to buy replacement lands to benefit the trust beneficiaries.
Only after that process concluded, the previous public lands commissioner rushed through a hasty public hearing and public comment period from late October through mid-December last year. The results of that process were overwhelmingly supportive of the trust land transfer option and critical of the sale option to Blue Fern Development. The Spokane City Council passed a resolution calling for the board to delay the vote to ensure the right decision. This is all well chronicled in more than 15 local print, television and radio stories.
Current Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove did not get a chance to examine or vote on the Thorpe sale that came before the board on Jan. 7 because it was a week before he took office. However, he and the Board of Natural Resources can exercise a provision in the sale agreement to terminate the contract before April 6, 2025. This would allow a real discussion and conversation to occur about what is the best option to sell or transfer the Thorpe property to benefit trust beneficiaries, DNR, the city of Spokane, and local residents.
More than 25 local Spokane organizations, businesses, and elected officials, including the Spokane City Council, are calling for a reexamination of the agreement at the upcoming April 1 BNR meeting. Upthegrove and the board should join them.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/thorpe-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-29 13:04:52.155390

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Even if the Montana Supreme Court decides to suspend Attorney General Austin Knudsen for 90 days, the penalty doesn’t mean he needs to lose his elected office — that’s one thing his lawyer and the lawyer for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel agreed on.
Friday, the Montana Supreme Court, including district court judges sitting in for recused justices, heard arguments about whether Knudsen should be punished for statements he and lawyers under his supervision made that disparaged the court and for defying a court order.
At the hearing, newly sworn in Chief Justice Cory Swanson peppered both lawyers with questions, as did Justice Katherine Bidegaray and some of the five judges sitting in for recused justices.
Christian Corrigan, on behalf of Knudsen, argued the court should dismiss the complaint, a “highly irregular and unprecedented” one, and he said a more appropriate action from the court would be a “letter of caution” to his client.
“This entire process, from investigation, complaint to hearing, has been tainted by persistent due process violations,” Corrigan said.
However, Timothy Strauch, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, urged the court to find suspension appropriate to protect the integrity of the court and the rule of law.
“No lawyer is above this court’s constitutional regulatory authority,” Strauch said. “We do not have here a contrite or apologetic respondent, but a defiant one, to this day, who blames the court, the Commission (on Practice), myself and my predecessor.”
The lawyers argued and judges fired questions in front of a full house, including high-profile Republican legislators and members of the public. Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, former state Sen. Keith Regier, and Montana Family Foundation President Jeff Laszloffy were among those in the gallery.
Swanson, who pointed out Knudsen likely supervises more attorneys than anyone in the state, also questioned the process, and he asked the lawyers where to draw the line.
Lawyers pledge to adhere to their rules of professional conduct, and the Commission on Practice, which regulates the profession, upheld 41 separate ethics violations against the Knudsen last year.
“It would seem strange for us to just rule the attorney general is not subject to those rules in some regard,” Swanson said. “So help us figure out where that line is.”
The case is unusual.
It raised questions about how the state’s top attorney, also head of an agency, should conduct himself, and it fueled a simmering dispute between the legislative and judicial branches in 2021 that has continued in Montana.
In the September 2023 complaint, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline against members of the state bar, alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers— allegations one of his lawyers initially described as a “political stunt.”
A hearing took place in October 2024, and Knudsen acknowledged he might have refrained from the “sharp” language he used in his representation of the legislature in 2021.
In fiery letters from the Attorney General’s Office about the dispute, Knudsen said he saw evidence of “judicial misconduct,” “self interest,” “actual impropriety” and “bias” by the court, according to court records.
Records also show Knudsen and a lawyer under his supervision both said they would not follow orders: “The legislature does not recognize this Court’s … order as binding and will not abide it.”
Bidegaray said defying a court order goes to the heart of the matter. During the 2021 fight, the legislature sought to subpoena judicial records, the court quashed the subpoena, but Knudsen didn’t immediately return records.
Bidegaray wondered what the consequences would be if the top lawyer in Montana was allowed to disobey a court order simply because he considered it invalid.
“Does that not set the tone, or the trickle down of behavior, to the attorneys?” Bidegaray said. “ … Does that not then set some sort of standard that allows every other attorney to disregard court orders?”
Corrigan said the court was on notice that Knudsen disagreed with the order, and the situation veered into unanswered questions of law. Swanson said one problem was that the issue wasn’t dealt with in real time, such as with a motion to compel filed by the other party.
Bidegaray, though, said it might have been more prudent, when traversing new legal terrain, for the AG to have sought a “stay,” or pause, “instead of just disregarding a court order.”
In October 2024 following the hearing, the Commission on Practice unanimously recommended the Montana Supreme Court suspend Knudsen for 90 days for multiple violations of rules.
Corrigan, though, argued the Commission on Practice botched the proceedings in numerous ways, and as a result, he said the Montana Supreme Court should toss the recommendation for a suspension.
Corrigan, with the Attorney General’s Office, said Knudsen acknowledged he would have done some things differently, but he also was acting in a “narrow scenario,” where he was discharging other professional duties.
As such, Corrigan suggested the court at most issue a “letter of caution” that Knudsen walked right up to the line, and he said such an outcome would “turn down the temperature.”
Corrigan also warned the Montana Supreme Court that it shouldn’t make an example of Knudsen, and he said punishing the attorney general wouldn’t help people have faith in their branch of government.
“Obviously, disciplining the Attorney General on this record would not do anything to increase confidence in the judiciary,” Corrigan said.
If the court just tried to turn down the temperature, though, Judge Luke Berger said he wondered if the court would leave the door open for more of the same, without some strict guidance: “What is to stop it from happening in the future?”
On behalf of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, Strauch said he understood the legislature felt strongly that the court had engaged in misconduct, and it retained the “strongest advocate” in the state in Knudsen.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that he fought vigorously for his client,” Strauch said.
But he also said Knudsen crossed the line when he attacked the integrity and qualifications of the court “completely unnecessarily,” and he requested the Montana Supreme Court draw that same line and follow the commission’s recommendation.
“Do we live in a world where these rules are just sort of a quaint reminder about concepts like respect for the rule of law and professionalism?” Strauch asked. Or is it a world where lawyers who swear to protect and defend the constitution and follow the rules are treated equally?
Strauch said he and the AG agree that the suspension would not set up a vacancy in the office, or a situation where Knudsen would need to be replaced.
According to briefings in the case, state law says the office becomes vacant if the attorney general fails to discharge duties for three consecutive months, but a suspension of even 90 days doesn’t need to run consecutively, and the court could also set a period that would ensure it wouldn’t equal three months (August 1 through Oct. 29, for example).
Also, the attorney general must be a lawyer in “good standing,” but a court briefing from Knudsen’s team said that is a qualification for running for office, not for continuing tenure. It also said the state Constitution allows for the removal of a judge, but not for an officer of another branch, and Montanans “overwhelmingly reelected” Knudsen while the case was pending.
“Any other act by one branch that purports to remove a constitutional officer of another branch would exceed constitutional bounds and raise grave constitutional concerns,” said the court filing.
Strauch said a suspension would preserve the rule of law.
Judge Gregory Bonilla, however, said the integrity of the judicial process is important, and key in the case. Bonilla said candidly, if he had worked with Knudsen, he would have cautioned him over his actions, but he said that’s just one question.
“There’s conduct,” Bonilla said. “And then there’s, ‘Did we do it right?’” In other words, he said, he might be certain someone engaged in criminal conduct, but if the search and seizure process was compromised, it doesn’t matter.
“This is what the attorney general is essentially saying, right?” Bonilla said.
Strauch, though, said both jurisprudence and due process are “sacrosanct,” and both were followed.
Swanson, who took office in January, told Strauch he didn’t like the statements that came from the attorney general and his team, but he didn’t like the way the process unfolded either.
“This thing is a mess from start to finish,” Swanson said. “I agree with you. A whole bunch of their statements and conduct on the front end look bad. But the proceeding, ruling on things without him having a chance to respond, and issuing this immediately before the election? … That looks political.”
Strauch agreed the timing could appear political, but he said the timing was due in a large part to the request from the attorney general’s team to delay the proceeding.
Strauch agreed the court had a range of options, from remanding the case for more information to full suspension, but Corrigan said a remand, or “third bite at the apple,” would not be fair to Knudsen.
“It would be inequitable for the Attorney General to have to go through this process again,” Corrigan said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/knudsen-hearing-day1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 13:04:52.155390

Lawmakers are getting ready for the last day of the 2025 legislative session on Friday, but they still drop some nuggets everywhere they go.
This week: Democratic discontent comes to the dome, a ride-or-die always Trumper gets rewarded with a new gig and some funny money, and state leaders try to decide whether to add more real money into their yearly salaries. 
Pay bump flop
House lawmakers quickly swatted down a last-minute Senate plan to give the governor and other statewide officials pay raises. 
The Senate had added the salary bumps Thursday to a bill adjusting the pay of judges at higher levels in Georgia. Under the plan, Gov. Brian Kemp would have been tied with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for the highest earning governor in the country. 
  Rep. Rob Leverett. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“You may have seen a little something about the amendment in the news over the last 24 hours,” the bill’s original sponsor, Elberton Republican Rep. Rob Leverett, said to his colleagues Friday. 
“I think that is a discussion we as a body need to have at some point, but we shouldn’t have it as an amendment to a bill in the last two or three days of session,” Leverett said. “I believe it needs to be thought through a little more and it needs a little more study.”
Some senators also tried to increase lawmaker pay in another judicial pay bill focused on superior court judges.
Critics argued that the legislative pay amendment would sabotage a bill intended to create uniform statewide pay for Georgia Superior Court judges. The proposed pay raise amendment to House Bill 85 would have increased the salaries of lawmakers from $24,341 to about $55,000.
Sen. Randal Mangham, a Stone Mountain Democrat, argued it would put Georgia lawmakers in line with the national average of $44,320 in 2024, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
He referenced the limited funding he receives for his staff. 
“$7,000 for an entire year with my budget for expenses to run the people’s business. It’s a $40 billion enterprise,” Mangham said, referring to the state budget.
Sen. John Kennedy, a Macon Republican, urged senators prior to voting to consider how passing the amendment would come across to the taxpayers.
“Colleagues, are you willing to look at your constituents in the eye and tell them you need more of their tax dollars in your pocket and out of their pocket?” Kennedy said.
The debate ended with the legislative pay amendments failing 33 to 18 before the superior court legislation passed with nearly unanimous support.
Dems in disarray
In the wake of a bitter loss to President Donald Trump, Democrats across the country are trying to figure out where it all went wrong. 
A recent Politico analysis of a Quinnipiac poll found that for the first time in the poll’s history, a majority of Democrats view members of their party in Congress unfavorably. Just 40 percent of Democrats polled said the party is doing a good job, compared to 49 percent who said the opposite. 
A March NBC News poll found 65% of self-identified Democrats want the party to fight Trump rather than seek compromise, even if that leads to gridlock in Washington. Around this time in Trump’s first term, only 33% of Democrats felt that way, the pollster found.
That discontent could be springing forth at the state level as well. 
The Forsyth County Democrats released a statement castigating Democrats in Congress and the state Legislature for “voting like Republicans.”
“With democracy itself at stake – and with the public’s frustration with figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk high – we cannot afford to hand political or legislative victories to Republicans or to validate their agenda while our constituents and values hang in the balance,” the statement reads. “Likewise, here in Georgia, amid widespread discontent with Governor Brian Kemp’s hard-right legislative push, it is imperative that Democrats stand together rather than bolster Kemp’s initiatives that harm the public interest.”
The statement lists three pieces of legislation where some Democrats broke rank – Senate Bill 68, Kemp’s priority lawsuit overhaul bill, supported by three Democrats; Senate Bill 144, liability protections for fertilizer and pesticide manufacturers with the support of nine Democrats and House Bill 267, which bans transgender girls from playing on girls’ school sports teams and got votes from three Dems.
Trump U.S. Treasurer Legislature’s newly popular kid

Republican Sen. Brandon Beach’s selection as President Donald Trump’s choice to become the next U.S. Treasurer has boosted his popularity.
Beach signed fake currency featuring the face of Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch reading “In Goochie We Trust” that was passed around the Capitol last week. The 63-year-old Beach’s signature as U.S. treasurer could soon be emblazoned on the front of real legal tender in the future.   
The senator’s role in state government will end shortly after the Legislature gavels out on April 4 for the final day of the 2025 session.
Beach will act as a liaison between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, as well as oversee the U.S. Mint and Fort Knox. The president is boosting a conspiracy theory these days that some of the gold is missing from Fort Knox and says he plans to go to Kentucky to see for himself if the country’s treasure is still secured. 
Inside the Senate chamber Wednesday, fellow Trump loyalist GOP Lt. Gov. Burt Jones celebrated Beach’s new job opportunity. 
Jones recalled that not long ago they were part of a small cadre of hardline Trump supporters in the Senate who were persona non grata, even among fellow Republicans.

(File photo from iStock / Getty Images Plus)Colorectal cancer is a formidable adversary, ranking as the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
In 2024 alone, the American Cancer Society estimated 53,000 lives were lost nationwide to this disease, with 2,580 new cases and 920 deaths in South Carolina alone.
The stakes are high — but the prognosis is far more optimistic when the cancer is detected early, thanks to screening tests.
The five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is 91% when caught in early stages, then plummets to 13% when it’s discovered in late stages after symptoms usually begin to show.
Yet, more than one in three adults in the U.S. age 45 and over — that’s 50 million Americans — are not up to date with recommended screening.
Health care providers play a crucial role in improving colorectal cancer screening rates, with primary care providers on the front lines.
As a primary care physician, I take a whole person approach to patient care that prioritizes both treating illness as it arises and proactive care aimed at maintaining overall health and preventing diseases.
Cancer screening is a critical tool in this effort, and I am committed to ensuring that my patients not only get screened for colorectal cancer and other cancers but are educated about the choices they have for effective screening options.
Recently, I saw results from a national survey that explored attitudes about screening in the lead-up to National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month this March.
The survey findings are both alarming and hopeful.
Nine out of 10 physicians surveyed are, understandably, worried about the high percentage of
patients who do not complete colorectal cancer screenings. The reasons for this are multifaceted, but one of the most prevalent is fear and anxiety.
According to the survey, 74% of primary care physicians and close to a third of patients (29%) report that fear or anxiety is a barrier to completing screening.
But there is promising news. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new blood test, Shield, which offers a simpler alternative to traditional screening methods. It requires no preparation or procedures — just a quick blood draw, which may make it a more appealing option for many patients.
The potential impact of blood-based testing is significant. The survey found that 93% of physicians and 86% of Americans believe avoiding or delaying colorectal cancer screenings is less likely if patients are presented with an FDA-approved blood test option.
Moreover, 92% of Americans are more likely to get a colonoscopy if they have a positive result on a blood screening test first.
These statistics underscore the potential of a blood-based screening option to increase overall screening rates and save lives.
The introduction of blood-based screening can play a crucial role in bridging the CRC screening gap. By offering more and easier screening options to patients, providers can help ensure that more patients get the test they need.
By integrating blood-based screening into our practices, primary care providers can help more South Carolinians stay up to date with their colorectal cancer screenings and ultimately save more lives.
Together, right here in the Palmetto State, we can make a difference in the fight against colorectal cancer.

On Friday, members of the legislature’s Environment Committee unveiled new language for Senate Bill 1523, a proposal that would have allowed the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish and regulate a bear hunting season. Instead, the new bill stripped out much of that language and replaced it with new rules that expand the circumstances under which farmers may be allowed to kill bears for damaging their crops.
“Despite the title of this bill, an ‘Act Concerning Bear Hunting,’ this bill is not moving forward a bear hunt,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who serves as co-chair of the committee.
The move marked the latest time that lawmakers in Connecticut have pulled back on proposals to allow bear hunting, which is practiced in most surrounding states with the exception of Rhode Island.
A black bear hunt in Conn.? Legislators are considering it, again.

Proponents of a hunt say it would help reduce conflicts with the state’s growing population of black bears, which DEEP estimates ranges from 1,000 to 1,200 bears. Opponents, however, argue that hunting would do little to deal with the most problematic bears — which are often found roaming away from the woods into populated areas — and that it does not align with the state’s values.
“It’s getting through to elected officials that hunting is not a solution to resolving bear conflicts,” Annie Hornish, a co-founder of the CT Coalition to Protect Bears, said Friday.
Hornish said she was disappointed lawmakers opted not to provide funding for bear-resistant trash cans and a more robust public awareness campaign to encourage people to take steps to avoid attracting bears as part of the legislation.
“That would have been the best outcome, but we’re happy that they’re not moving forward with hunting,” she said.
After announcing their revisions to the bill Friday, members of the Environment Committee voted 27-6 to advance the legislation to the Senate. All six opposing votes came from Democrats.
One of those voting no, state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, said the bill still did not do enough to find non-lethal solutions for dealing with bears that forage on crops, such as using packs of specially trained dogs to harass bears away from farms.
“We’re basically laying out a buffet for these bears and then we’re kind of shocked when they show up and eat it,” Mushinsky said.
Other lawmakers lamented the decision to back off of a hunt, which they noted had the support of DEEP and Gov. Ned Lamont.
“We constantly find ways to negate a real bear management plan,” said state Rep. Karen Reddington-Hughes, R-Woodbury. “For the record, the bill was not about a trophy hunt… it was about public safety that is presently in danger because of our inaction.”
The last time legislation was seriously considered to allow a hunt, in 2023, it was similarly amended by the Environment Committee to remove hunting provisions. Instead, that bill set up a process by which farmers could apply for a permit from DEEP allowing them to kill nuisance animals damaging their crops, livestock or bee hives.
Those rules allowed farmers to kill 15 bears last year, according to DEEP.
But state Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, said the process has moved too slowly for some farmers who find the bears gone by the time they get approval from wildlife officials. Horn helped draft the revisions to S.B. 1523 that would allow farmers to get permission to kill a bear up to a year after it is documented damaging crops if it returns to the same property.
“Bears can destroy acres of crops in a short period of time,” Horn said Friday. “If they have to watch that happen, get a permit, and then come back for the bear, by that time the bear is gone. You’ve lost the crop for the season.”
Hornish said on Friday that the Coalition to Protect Bears has concerns about how farmers will verify whether a bear is the same individual they’ve have problems with in the past. Lawmakers said Friday they will continue to work on the exact language of the bill as it moves forward.

Senate Bill 93 would boost funding for school districts that are currently enrolled in early education programs under the Alaska Reads Act. The bill would increase per-student funding from half funding to the full amount for other students within the state’s public education funding formula. 
The Alaska Reads Act program supports early literacy for pre-K through grade 3 with the aim of improving reading. 
“The concept isn’t new,” said Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, the bill’s sponsor, citing a body of research supporting improved lifelong learning outcomes following pre-K programs. “For every dollar we invest in high quality early learning, we see a $32 return on investment in increased earning potential, higher graduation rates, higher engagement and post-secondary opportunities.”
She explained with the outmigration of families and children from Alaska, funding early learning programs would encourage young student enrollment. “Last year, the Legislative Finance Division indicated about 3,700 kids left our public education system in total,” she said. “So what our hope is, is not only to provide districts with full funding to maintain their pre-elementary programs, but also to help balance out that outmigration with incoming students.”
School districts can choose to offer prekindergarten in Alaska, and districts’ enrollment in early learning programs under the Alaska Reads Act is also voluntary. Currently the participating districts are Anchorage, Skagway and Valdez.
The Department of Education estimates the funding increase would cost roughly $7.6 million, already requested in Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s budget proposal for next year, going towards funding the Alaska Reads Act, according to a fiscal note to the bill. 
State Education Commissioner Deena Bishop said that the governor’s budget includes roughly $4.7 million to sustain funding for existing early education programs and $3 million to expand the number of districts with these programs. The Alaska Reads Act planned for annual increases in funding and programs, Bishop said in a text statement through a spokesperson.
“We look forward to all Alaska school districts who desire to serve their communities with pre-schools, can do so,” she said. “The Alaska Reads Act was a transformational piece of legislation. The present bill builds on its success.”
Tobin said the increased funding could also help alleviate child care costs for families. “We know those pre-K kids are in their communities, their parents might be struggling to braid together support for child care, or for babysitting,” she said. “And by not only providing stability for districts to offer these programs, we also are helping them in stabilizing their school population, and also helping families that are looking for child care options that are high quality and available.”
The bill now is set to be heard in the Senate Finance Committee, where Tobin hopes lawmakers support the education investment. “We know it’s not going to have an impact on our budget. And we do know the fiscal notes of the Alaska Reads Act were adopted when the bill was passed in 2022, so it’s not going to have a discernible impact on our current budget projections.”

Shapiro won the 36th Senate District in 2022 with a 0.2% margin over his Republican opponent, Trump-aligned Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin.
“If we could get to Shapiro-Mastriano numbers, I knew we could take this,” Stella Sexton, told the Capital-Star about the campaign’s approach to flipping the long-time Republican Senate district.
Malone did better with a stunning upset in the 36th District special election Tuesday. He beat Republican County Commissioner Joshua Parsons by 0.89%, according to unofficial results, and became the first Democrat to represent Lancaster County in the Pennsylvania Senate since 1879.
Parsons conceded Wednesday afternoon, saying in a post on the social media platform X that a review of the remaining ballots showed there were not enough uncounted votes to change the outcome.

Having reviewed the numbers from last night, including the fact that there are not enough provisional or other outstanding ballots to change the overall result, I have called Mayor Malone to congratulate him and wish him the best.

— Josh Parsons (@Josh__Parsons) March 26, 2025
The Democratic victory drew national attention as the latest in a string of special election wins across the country. Although it did not change control of the Senate, it reduced Republicans’ majority in the Senate to 27-23.
Ryan Aument, who ran unopposed for the seat in 2022, resigned last year to work for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick.
Democrats attribute the win, in part, to voters who feel betrayed by what they describe as President Donald Trump’s draconian and tumultuous first months in office.
“Folks are not happy with the chaos that we’re seeing in Washington and are not happy with Parsons,” Malone said, recounting what he heard from voters as he knocked on doors across the district, which President Donald Trump won by more than 15%.
Parsons campaigned on his reputation as a conservative firebrand who defied the state-ordered lockdown during the COVID-19 emergency, an abortion opponent and Trump ally.
But he also drew national attention for his harassment of a reporter at Lancaster Online/LNP and stoking anger over a drag queen story hour at Lancaster Public Library. The library ultimately canceled the event when a bomb threat and suspicious package shut down downtown Lancaster in March 2024.
“A lot of what we heard was they didn’t like his negativity and they didn’t like that he was voting against them,” Malone said.
Efforts to reach Parsons on Wednesday through his campaign’s website, Facebook page and campaign officials were unsuccessful.
A Republican official blamed Parsons’ defeat on a loss of focus after the 2024 election.
“This is a wake up call. We can’t rest on the laurels of last November’s great victories,” Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman said in a post. “We can’t be complacent and we must be unified. We need to keep the intensity of 2024 and fight together for every vote.”
Franklin & Marshall College pollster Berwood Yost said the outcome was both surprising and followed a trend so far in 2025.
“When you have a Republican who loses the district with a 23 point registration advantage, that qualifies as a surprise,” Yost said.
At the same time, Democrats have won five special elections across the country this year, Yost noted. That has a lot to do with the electorate in special elections, when turnout is typically low. In Lancaster county, 29% or about 54,000 registered voters participated.
The emphasis for national Democrats on Tuesday was the special election for the 35th House District in Allegheny County, where the party focused efforts to defend the one-seat majority it won in November. The seat was left empty in January when Rep. Matthew Gergely died after suffering a medical emergency.
Democrat Dan Goughnour won the election with 63.4% of the vote, according to unofficial results.
Special election voters tend to be more tuned-in and have more education, which favors Democrats, Yost said. It also tracks trends following presidential elections, when there is typically a swing toward the party not in the White House or in the majority in Washington.
“When you look back to Trump’s first term, there was a big swing toward Democrats in special elections at that time,” Yost said.
State Rep. Nikki Rivera, D-Lancaster, said Malone was a perfect foil to Parsons, who espoused many positions of the MAGA movement.
As the mayor of East Petersburg, a borough of about 4,500 people a short distance from Lancaster, Malone earned a reputation as a person who leads by example and shows genuine concern and compassion for people.
“He’s known for being personable and connecting with people on all sides of a topic,” Rivera said. “He is truly able to cross party lines to understand and be understood.”
But outside his small community, Malone had “almost no name recognition,” Sexton said. That called for a grassroots effort to introduce him to voters in more than two dozen municipalities.
Iowa inspiration
Sexton said she found inspiration in Iowa Democrat Mike Zimmer’s victory, flipping a state Senate seat in January.
“I reached out to them and said we have to know how you did it,” Sexton said. “They gave us their whole plan.”
Lancaster Democrats enlisted phone banking help from county committees across Pennsylvania and launched a ground game that included “obsessively” tracking mail ballots and dispatching volunteers to retirement communities to follow up with voters, Sexton said.
She said Malone worked hard, meeting voters and attending a League of Women Voters forum that Parsons skipped. Libertarian Zachary Moore of Mount Joy was there too, and won 480 votes, almost exactly the margin by which Parsons lost, Sexton noted.
Sexton said Malone’s campaign spent about $215,000, an amount she estimates is tied with or slightly greater than Parsons’ spending. Campaign finance reports show money continued to flow to the candidates in the final 24 hours of the race.
Parsons’s campaign was supported by GOP activist Scott Presler, who helped turn out Amish voters in the 2024 general election. Presler, who has drawn criticism for his anti-Muslim language, rung early alarm bells about a possible Democratic victory, drawing the attention of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, Lancaster Online reported this week.
Sexton said Musk’s post came too late to help Parsons’ fundraising. But it reinforced Malone’s message.
“Parsons was really being supported by billionaires and ours was a grassroots campaign and that was really a contrast that resonated with people,” Sexton said.
When Pressler posted on X late Tuesday night lamenting Parsons’ apparent loss, Musk replied with a one word post: “Damn.”

“It is scary to be a college student right now because of the attacks by the Trump administration against DEI, the cutting of funding, and immigrant students being abducted by ICE. We want to protect our community on campus”, said Olivia Schaefer, 20, Social Relations and Policy student and Chair of the Sunrise MSU movement. “Our First Amendment is free speech, so we are doing the right thing by being here and raising our voices.”

The rally coincided with the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion offices by the University of Michigan, following new policies from Washington that are affecting DEI offices at universities across the country. It also followed the arrest of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, one of the last of the nearly dozen international students arrested so far.

“While it’s true we haven’t seen any changes here at MSU, as we just saw at Columbia University and U of M, federal funding is on the line, and universities will have to go where the money is. Fundamentally, that’s a problem because we need to prioritize diversity and education,” Schaefer emphasized.
In an interview with The State News, MSU president Kevin Guskiewicz emphasized that ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts will remain a priority despite threats from Washington.’ Although vacant positions and building projects could be rethought amid budget riskiness, Guskiewicz said he and his team will analyze the university’s financial situation concerning potential funding cuts.
Jesse Estrada White, 21, a Comparative Cultures and Policies student and member of the Sunrise movement, who, along with four other students, was arrested on Oct. 25, 2024, after a sit-in demonstration inside the Hannah Administration Building as part of a pro-Palestinian action, emphasized the importance of a clear position from MSU.

“Now, the situation isn’t as bad as U of M, but the university has given us nothing so far. They say that all students are safe and welcome on campus, but they haven’t explicitly said anything against Trump’s policies, especially against the abduction of immigrant students. Silence and platitudes, that’s what we got,”Estrada said.
The rally proceeded without major incidents. The protesters remained at the main entrance of the administration building for about an hour, as the sky cleared after the rain.
Posters against the Trump administration, Elon Musk, and fascism, with slogans such as ‘MSU rejects Fascism’ and ‘Student Power,’ were held up, along with chants and screams including “This is what democracy looks like” and “We want divestment now”.
A series of speakers, including student activist leaders, student associations, and members of Sunrise, led the demonstration.
“We are calling on this university to take a stand against state crimes. This university has an active role to play, making sure that students on this campus are safe and that students across the state, and the country are safe as well,” Estrada said.

“We fight fascism,” all the participants shouted together as the rally concluded.
“This rally is just a step, a step in the right direction. Even though they ignored us before, we’ll keep demanding the university authorities to talk to us”, said Omar Anasara, 19, Philosophy student and member of Students for Justice in Palestine at MSU.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA, Kan. — The bullhorn-powered war of words between satanists and Catholics boiled over into brawling and a handful of arrests Friday during an extraordinary event at the Kansas Capitol that pushed boundaries of free speech and the separation of church and state.
After about two hours of speeches, prayers and sign waving among hundreds of people mostly segregated by barricades staffed by law enforcement officers, Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart, with supporters and reporters in tow, entering the Statehouse to conduct what he had described as a black mass. He was warned at the door to the visitors’ center that any formal protest inside the building that violated a permit limiting his religious expression to the lawn or steps of the Capitol would result in his arrest for trespassing.


In the rotunda, Stewart began delivering the rebellious alternative mass and was interrupted by three people intent on stopping what could be interpreted as a mockery of their faith. An unidentified man and woman, with young kids at their side, physically intervened to interrupt Stewart. He spun away from them. Counter-protester Marcus Schroeder joined the fray and twice reached to rip papers from Stewart’s hand. Stewart responded by punching Schroeder in the face twice. More than half a dozen Capitol Police wrestled Stewart to the floor to make the arrest.
“I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting,” Stewart repeatedly yelled.
Schroeder, who wore a shirt declaring “death is not welcome here,” wasn’t arrested by Capitol Police. In an interview, he defended his intervention to thwart Stewart.
“He was trying to give a satanic chant. I tried to take his paper out of his hand and he punched me twice in the face,” Schroeder said.

After the area cleared, two other satanists tried to pick up where Stewart left off and were taken into custody. One other person was cuffed and led away by law enforcement outside the Capitol. An individual had grabbed Stewart by the legs in a bid to stop Stewart from stomping on crackers intended to represent those used in a Catholic mass. In that brief exchange, Stewart also punched the guy before law enforcement ended the fracas.
“He was was trying to tackle me to get to the cracker underneath,” Stewart said. “I was able to kind of fend him off. I do think he may have picked up the crumbled cracker and ate it. Did I get physical with him? Yes.”
  Hundreds of Christians upset with an organization’s plan to conduct a satanic black mass at the Kansas Capitol delivered a robust counter-protest to emphasize their disdain for followers of Satanic Grotto. Both sides of the debate used bullhorns to punctuate their messages, creating a blended sound that was difficult for anybody to hear clearly. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
The opposition
The colorful display of affection and affliction for organized religion culminated attempts by Gov. Laura Kelly, Attorney General Kris Kobach, leaders of the Kansas Legislature and Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, to restrain or derail the demonstration planned by Satanic Grotto.
Kelly had the group’s permit amended so no protest could transpire inside the Capitol. Legislative leaders modified policy regarding use of the Capitol to target Satanic Grotto. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, said the First Amendment didn’t protect offensive speech or violations of law.
Francis Slobodnik, a Topeka representative of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, told hundreds of Catholics gathered on the south side of the Capitol that public officials shouldn’t have allowed satanists to assemble on public property. He said the process showed a misguided understanding of freedom of speech and religion and a lack of appreciation for how a black mass represented worship of Satan.
“Today’s horrific event, the first of its kind in the history of Kansas, is a sacrilege,” said Slobodnik, who urged people to engage in a peaceful rally. “Of course, there have been terrible crimes and injustices that have happened in our state over the years. However, nothing in our past compares with what is happening today where God is being directly challenged on the state Capitol grounds. The state Capitol represents all of us.”
He praised people at the rally who were standing in opposition to Satanic Grotto, and referred to them as the Navy Seals of the Catholic faith. He said these activists were willing to confront God’s enemies head-on as if on a field of battle. He said the great sin perpetrated by Stewart and other worshipers of Satan meant that others had to step into the void.
“Satanists do not realize that Satan hates all of God’s creation, including them,” Slobodnik said. “Their reward for worshiping and serving him will be eternal fire.”
  Cure Church member Daniel Casteel, center with megaphone, was among Christians who used amplified equipment Friday, March 28, 2025, at the Kansas Capitol to broadcast invitations for people to renounce Satan and welcome Jesus into their lives. He proclaimed to his target audience across a law enforcement barrier: “Any time you’re ready, you can step this way. We will make sure you get saved.” (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
And, an exorcist
Former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who served in the Kansas Senate before elected to Congress, said he consulted with a priest with experience in exorcism when considering whether to participate in a television interview with Stewart.
“Father had a simple question: ‘Why would you do this? What do you hope to gain?’ I stumbled around in my answer,” Huelskamp said. “I wanted to share the truth about Christ. The truth about the Eucharist. His summary response was quite stunning to me. He said, ‘There is no good that could come from being in the same room with a satanist.’”
Huelskamp said it was suggested his participation in the interview with Stewart might advance the interests of Satan. The former Republican congressman woke ill the next day, and cancelled the interview. In the end, Huelskamp said he decided it was important to run to the fire created by Satan rather than shrink from it. He said it was the same as making his views known about the evil of abortion or defending the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman.
“I am quite stubborn and hardheaded,” he said. “We cannot be silent. We are required, if we call ourselves Christians, if we call ourselves Catholic, we are publicly required to defend the faith and to stand up for the truth.”
In an interview amid calm before the storm of his arrest, Stewart said he was convinced Catholics assembled around him didn’t understand why Satanic Grotto was at the Capitol to talk about religious oppression.
“What we only want is the rights that every American has,” Stewart said. “I’ve heard people say we’re setting a precedent. Well, if the precedent is freedom of religion for everyone in public spaces, yes, that’s what we’re trying to establish. We are dragging this issue out in the light and we’ll let the people look at it. The issue is that we’re not all being treated the same here.”
  Mike Trapp, of Leavenworth, Kansas, said he took part in rallies outside the State Capitol on Friday, March 28. 2025, to express his view that government needed to respect the constitutional mandate of a formal separation between church and state. He said the rise of Christian nationalists represented the greatest threat to democracy. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)
Other voices in crowd
Eudora resident John More, a Christian who carried a call-to-heaven New England pine tree flag, said he was motivated to attend because he viewed the satanists’ criticism of Catholics as an assault on religion in general. He joined with Julie Britschge of Burlingame for a “Jericho Walk,” or prayer walk, by circling the statehouse grounds seven times. Britschge said the walk was patterned after the biblical story of the Israelites’ march aimed at bringing about spiritual change.
“We’re hoping that whatever evil there is today, that He will take care of it,” More said. “I was just planning to add a measure of divine protection.”
Daniel Casteel and Shawn Velasquez, both with the Cure Church, made their views heard with the aid of megaphones. They prowled the security-line perimeter sharing perspectives on religion before taking part in back-and-forth exchanges across the barrier with supporters of Satanic Grotto.
“Jesus loves you,” Casteel bellowed. “Any time you’re ready, you can step this way. We will make sure you get saved. Come give your life to Jesus, please. Break the stronghold.”
In an interview, Velasquez and Casteel said their intent was to convince one or two satanic worshipers to find solace in God.
“They’re just misguided and uninformed,” Velasquez said. “They’re worshiping a false god.”
On the other side of that line, Mike Trapp of Leavenworth quietly held a sign that emphasized his belief the United States was best served by adhering to the constitutional principle of a formal separation between church and state.
“We wouldn’t be standing here today if there weren’t Christians flaunting their religion in the Capitol,” said Trapp, who considered the rise of Christian nationalism to be “the biggest threat to democracy.”
Wichita residents Kyle Francis and Sam McCrory, who were armed with a gun, flag and a collection of religious symbols, said they were present to stand up for Christ.
“Any time that people who oppose Christ show their head, you know, they should be opposed publicly,” McCrory said.
He said separation of church and state was originally the product of a homogenous Christian population. Satanists and others who diluted that national unity often used constitutional freedoms as a weapon against well-meaning people, he said.
“These sorts of things need to be brutally tamped down,” McCrory said. “Let’s set an example. I think that the United States should be an explicitly Christian nation. If you want to be something other than Christian, I think that’s fine, to an extent. I think they (non-Christians) should have to pay an extra tax.”

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Death row inmate Mikal Mahdi chose to die by firing squad, making him the second person in the state to do so since executions resumed, his attorneys said Friday.
Mahdi, 42, was sentenced to death in 2006 for shooting and killing off-duty police officer James Myers with his own rifle as part of a multi-state crime spree. The only remaining man on death row with no remaining appeals, Mahdi is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. April 11.
Brad Sigmon, executed March 7, was the first inmate in the state to die by firing squad, which legislators made an option in 2021. The three other inmates executed since September selected lethal injection.
By law, death row inmates have until two weeks before their execution date to choose whether they will die by firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, which legislators made the default method in 2021. Mahdi chose “the lesser of three evils,” his attorney, David Weiss, said in a statement Friday.
“Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney,” Weiss said.
SC inmate executed by firing squad, a first nationwide since 2010

Legislators added firing squad as an option after years of struggling to get the drugs used for lethal injection. Inmates challenged the method, as well as electrocution, arguing it violated the constitutional right to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.
The state Supreme Court ruled last year that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional methods of execution, allowing the process to resume after a 13-year hiatus. By that point, lethal injection was again an option, after Department of Corrections officials were able to restock their supply thanks to a law keeping everything about the drugs and the companies selling them a secret.
Inmates have challenged that secrecy law, arguing inmates have a right to know more about the drugs that would kill them. But the state Supreme Court and a federal judge have both turned down those arguments, ruling officials have disclosed everything the law requires for an inmate to make his choice.
Barring intervention from a court or the governor, Mahdi would become the fifth in the nation to be executed by firing squad, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Other than Sigmon, the remaining three took place in Utah, which last conducted a firing squad execution in 2010. Utah’s next death row inmate in line for execution, Ralph Menzies, also faces a firing squad, pending the outcome of his competency appeal.
Mahdi will be strapped to a chair, facing three rectangular openings 15 feet away. Three firing squad members will shoot through those openings, using .308 Winchester bullets, which expand and fragment on impact, causing a more instantaneous death, corrections officials have said previously.
“Before Mikal committed these tragic murders, he was a child in desperate need of care and support,” Weiss said in a statement. “We will continue to fight for the child Mikal was and the man he is today. Executing Mikal on this record would ignore the many ways we failed him in favor of one final injustice.”
Mikal Mahdi
On July 14, 2004, in his hometown of Lawrenceville, Virginia, Mahdi stole a car and a gun before fleeing south. Stopping in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Mahdi shot gas station clerk Christopher Boggs point-blank in the head while Boggs was verifying his ID to buy a beer, according to court documents.
Mahdi continued on to South Carolina, where he carjacked a man in Columbia and drove to Calhoun County. He stopped at a gas station, where a clerk seemed to grow suspicious after the gas pump declined his card. Mahdi fled on foot to a nearby farmhouse, where he hid out in Myers’ workshop.
When Myers, a captain for the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety, returned home at the end of the day, Mahdi shot him nine times with one of the rifles Myers kept there, according to court documents.
Mahdi lit Myers’ body on fire and stole his police truck, which he continued driving south. Police arrested Mahdi in Satellite Beach, Florida, on July 21, 2004, a week after he stole the first car.
Mahdi pleaded guilty to the crimes in 2006, at which point Judge Clifton Newman sentenced him to death.
SC death row inmate’s attorneys ask court to halt execution over traumatic childhood

Mahdi’s attorneys have asked the state Supreme Court to halt his execution, claiming a traumatic childhood influenced his development and led him to a life of crime.
Mahdi’s original defense attorneys hardly touched on his past, which could have convinced Newman to sentence him to life in prison instead of death, Mahdi’s current attorneys argued in court filings.
As a child, Mahdi struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, his attorneys claimed. He entered the juvenile justice system at age 14 for committing property crimes and spent most of his life in jails after that point, often in solitary confinement, his attorneys said.
Mahdi had been out of jail for about two months when he committed the crimes that landed him on death row.
“When we think of Mikal choosing his method of execution, we’re reminded of the tormented child who, at nine years old, told his teacher that he wanted to shoot himself. Or, on another occasion, to electrocute himself. Or, another time, to hang himself,” Weiss said in a statement Friday.
But Mahdi’s attorneys didn’t show anything the court hasn’t already considered and dismissed during the appeals process, the Attorney General’s Office responded in a filing this week. Mahdi’s difficult childhood and the impact it may have had on him have no legal bearing on his crime, the attorneys continued.
The state Supreme Court has not yet given a decision on the arguments.
The state’s highest court, as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, has yet to rule in favor of stopping a South Carolina inmate’s execution in the past six months. Mahdi can also appeal to Gov. Henry McMaster for clemency, which no governor has granted in the modern era.

Great Lakes Day is an annual summit where politicians and officials of all stripes gather in Washington, D.C., to demonstrate their commitment to the region home to the largest freshwater ecosystem on the planet. For years, leaders from the United States and Canada have met at the event without incident. But earlier this month and amid a tariff dispute between the two nations, the Trump administration abruptly disinvited two Canadian mayors from the long-standing White House meeting.
The last-minute exclusion of Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and St. Catharines Mayor Mat Siscoe came just 48 hours before the event due to “diplomatic protocols,” according to Christine Maydossian, a spokesperson for the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, which coordinates the meeting and submitted the names of the two Canadian mayors and one American to White House officials a month earlier.
Neither Canadian mayor responded to a request for comment.
Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump and his administration has repeatedly stoked tensions with Canada, once considered the United States’ closest ally. Along with trade and tariffs, this strife has also raised questions about how the region’s water resources will be managed. Amid the escalating political tensions, some Great Lakes advocates worry the diplomatic snub is a warning sign that one of the world’s most successful examples of water-sharing could become collateral damage in a geopolitical rift.
“We are worried that maybe behind all this is the idea that a country one day will be able to take water out of the Great Lakes and manage water not as an ecosystem that needs to be preserved in its watershed, but as a resource, as a commodity,” said Jérôme Marty, speaking as the director of the International Association for Great Lakes Research.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that in calls with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump had “mentioned revisiting the sharing of lakes and rivers between the two nations.”
“President Trump has made clear the need for Canada to stop ripping off the United States on trade. President Trump will explore any and all actions that put the interests of America first,” said Brian Hughes, a spokesperson with the National Security Council, in an emailed statement to Grist. (The White House did not respond directly to Grist’s questions about cooperation between the two countries concerning the Great Lakes.)
For over a century, the United States and Canada have worked in tandem to manage four of the five Great Lakes that straddle both countries: Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. That cooperative arrangement — with which the countries settle everything from water use to navigation to invasive species to pollution — may now be on the line.
“We cannot let this be sacrificed,” said Rachel Havrelock, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago who directs the Freshwater Lab, an environmental research initiative focused on the Great Lakes and environmental justice.
“This is the most stable, productive, and mutually beneficial form of binational water governance on Earth,” she added.
The lakes provide drinking water for more than 30 million people spread across both sides of the border. The U.S. and Canada, then under British rule, signed the Boundary Waters Treaty in 1909, a highly-praised water sharing agreement that formed the International Joint Commission, or IJC, a binational organization that aims to prevent and resolve disputes over shared lakes and rivers.
(The arrangements between the two countries long sidelined Indigenous nations, some of which the U.S.-Canada border artificially bisected. For example, the IJC did not invite Indigenous representatives to participate until the 1980s, despite the sovereign rights of those nations. Indigenous communities often face disproportionate impacts from pollution and climate change, and recent IJC assessments have acknowledged that strengthening relationships with Indigenous governments is key to improving its response to those threats.)
The relationship was further cemented by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, established in 1955, which coordinates how invasive species and fisheries are managed, and again by the 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which committed the two nations to “restore and maintain” the health of the lakes.
Those are just three among a layered patchwork of treaties and other agreements between local, state, federal, and tribal governments that determine Great Lakes management. Some don’t necessarily rely on federal involvement, such as the Great Lakes Agreement and Compact, which protects the water from being shipped to other states and regions.
Trump has cast doubt on the stability of these agreements by breaking a series of diplomatic taboos, including calling Canada the “51st state” and halting negotiations on the Columbia River Treaty, after referring to the British Columbia river as a “large faucet” that could be used to solve California’s water crisis last year.
Policy experts say Trump’s recent tack raises a red flag for the future of the Great Lakes.
“The water and the resources don’t recognize international boundaries,” said Mike Shriberg, a faculty member at the University of Michigan who specializes in Great Lakes policy. “You can’t manage things like invasive species from only one country and not the other. You can’t manage harmful algal blooms from one country or the other. The information on the flow of ice and what that means for shipping has to be shared across borders.”
Shriberg said the Trump administration’s funding freeze and staffing cuts related to management of the lakes are impacting how the U.S. will protect them and meet its obligations with Canada — concerns that prompted him to write an op-ed making the case for politicians to unify to protect the Great Lakes.
Some areas have shown signs of revival; the Great Lakes Fishery Commission’s sea lamprey program can begin rehiring U.S. federal workers to control the invasive species, which can wreak havoc on other fish. That means the program will move forward, albeit weeks behind schedule.
But other threats are visible, according to Shriberg: There are more bureaucratic roadblocks to federal scientists working with their Canadian counterparts on everything from harmful algal blooms to flooding — work he said had until this point been “seamless.”
“It’s often not happening because of the chaos within the agencies that’s being caused by all the cutbacks,” Shriberg said.
Those cutbacks have reached the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, which has been rocked by staffing upheavals, with a fifth of their employees reportedly retiring, resigning, fired, or on leave, including the communications team.
“You’re already seeing a breakdown in capacity to do the basic work that we need to protect the lakes,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/greatlakescanadaIMG_9122-1024x576.webp,,,2025-03-29 08:03:23.325072

The bill aims to make certain crimes where no death occurred, such as child sex abuse and child sex trafficking, eligible for the death penalty — a direct violation of the 8th Amendment as established in the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy v. Louisiana.
But Senate Bill 196 isn’t just about overturning one Supreme Court decision.
It’s part of a broader movement to dismantle decades of constitutional protections under the 8th Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment. If successful, it could lead to the return of automatic death sentences and even the execution of vulnerable defendants, including children and the intellectually disabled, and open the door to arbitrary sentencing that masks lynch-mob style racism.
In challenging the Supreme Court’s 2008 decision, Senate Bill 196 proponents would have Missouri join Florida and Tennessee in bringing back the death penalty for statutory rape and similar crimes. This movement seeks to repeal not just the Supreme Court decision, but a line of cases recognizing that the Framers understood the 8th Amendment should “draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.”
This line of cases started in 1958, when the court recognized that while we used to summarily execute wartime deserters, an American draftee who went AWOL for a matter of hours in a foreign land in the waning days of World War II could not be stripped of his U.S. citizenship — a punishment based on a pre-Civil War statute.
A national consensus had emerged that such punishment was disproportionate to the crime, making it cruel and unusual.
This understanding of the 8th Amendment has been the foundation for categorical rules limiting punishments for certain types of cases and defendants.
A 1977 case held that rape of an adult not resulting in death is categorically ineligible for death, reflecting the problematic “southern rape cases” in which Black men were sentenced to death for the rape of white women, the holding the Kennedy decision would later extend.
A pair of cases decided in 1982 and 1987 created the rule that a defendant who did not personally cause the death of the victim is only death-eligible if the defendant was a major participant in the underlying felony and recklessly ignored the foreseeable risk of death.
Decisions in 2002 and 2005 established categorical exemptions from the death penalty for intellectually disabled individuals and juveniles. The court also relied on this approach outside of capital cases, in 2010 and 2012 decisions prohibiting life without parole for juveniles convicted of non-homicide crimes and requiring individualized sentencing for juvenile homicide offenders.
These decisions reflect a growing consensus that the harshest punishments must be reserved for the worst of the worst.
If states succeed in dismantling the 8th Amendment’s protections, the consequences will be devastating. Imagine a return to the days when racial biases permeated death penalty decisions, as seen in the tragic case of George Stinney, a 14-year-old Black boy executed in 1944.
That Senate Bill 196 is part of this broader effort is not speculation. Missouri’s Attorney General has signed onto a brief  in a case from Alabama attacking the court’s requirement that intellectual disability be determined in keeping with current clinical practices, and explicitly attacking the entire line of “evolving standards of decency” cases.
Senate Bill 196 is likely part of an ever broader movement to carry out President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks “overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of state and federal governments to impose capital punishment.”
Florida’s recently enacted “Trump Act,” which proposes automatic death sentences for certain offenders, would challenge foundational cases which rejected automatic death penalty statutes and required case-by-case weighing of any mitigating evidence related to the circumstances of the crime or the character of the defendant.
Senate Bill 196 invites a future where the state wields the ultimate punishment with alarming arbitrariness.
The people of Missouri deserve a criminal justice system that reflects our progress, not one that drags us backward. Senate Bill 196 is a step in the wrong direction.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-646867352-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-03-29 07:02:33.375077

(Photo by Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

 Idaho governor signs immigration bill Thursday morning, state gets sued Thursday afternoon

At 9:10 a.m. on Thursday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 83, as amended. 
By early Thursday evening, a federal judge temporarily blocked the new immigration law from taking effect after the ACLU of Idaho sued the state – upholding its promise to do so from earlier in the 2025 legislative session.
The bill allows law enforcement to record a person’s documentation status if they are suspected of a crime.
Modeled after a controversial 2023 Texas law, the legislation creates Idaho immigration crimes “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry,” targeting individuals who do not have proper immigration authorization and those who have already been deported from coming to Idaho. Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a different crime. 
The law also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien,” or knowingly transporting an unauthorized immigrant who has previously been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or another country. The law grants immunity to law enforcement, meaning they are protected from lawsuits that could arise from the damages and liability they cause while enforcing the law.

The ACLU and the multiple plaintiffs in the case say the law is unconstitutional in several ways, including violating the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal law overrides state law, including in immigration matters.
Bill sponsors have said the bill’s purpose is to curb unauthorized migration and prevent dangerous unauthorized immigrants from entering Idaho. 
However, ACLU of Idaho legal director Paul Carlos Southwick said the bill clearly does not just target criminals. 
“You do not have to have any criminal conviction in order to be arrested, detained or prosecuted for these crimes,” he said in a press conference. “Law enforcement merely needs suspicion that you have engaged in some kind of independent crime.”
Because the bill had an emergency clause, it went into effect immediately after the governor signed it. The court’s temporary restraining order issued Thursday evening will prevent the law’s enforcement for 14 days. A preliminary injunction hearing in the case is scheduled at 10 a.m. April 10 at the federal courthouse in Boise.
 $100M property tax cut signed into law

Little also signed into law a bill that cuts property taxes and bolsters school districts’ bond issues and levies.
Joined by Idaho Republican legislative leaders at a livestreamed news conference in a Boise neighborhood on Wednesday, Little signed House Bill 304.

The new law reduces Idaho’s state tax revenue by $100 million every year, shifting funds in two ways:

It transfers $50 million to a state fund to reduce property taxes for Idaho homeowners.
And it sends another $50 million to a state fund that helps pay off school districts’ bond issues and levies.

The bill is the third major tax cut bill the Idaho Legislature passed this year, totalling $403 million in annual reductions to Idaho’s state revenue. 

House Bill 40 reduces the corporate and individual income tax rates from 5.695% to 5.3% and reduces state revenue by $253 million per year. When Little signed the bill, the governor’s office described the bill as the largest income tax cut in state history.
House Bill 231 increases the grocery tax credit used to offset the sales tax Idahoans pay on food to $155 per year. To increase the grocery tax credit, House Bill 231 reduces state revenue by $50 million every year.

Another new law this year, House Bill 93, provides a refundable tax credit for education expenses for families, including tuition at private, religious schools. That bill reduces the state’s revenue by $50 million – bringing total revenue reductions from those four bills to $453 million.
 Child care deregulation bill signed into law, despite opposition from children’s advocates

Little also signed into law a bill to deregulate child care centers that the bill’s sponsors said will help ease Idaho’s child care shortage crisis.  
House Bill 243 loosens state-set minimum child-to-staff ratio standards. The bill also preempts local governments from having more stringent child care regulations than issued by the state.
Idaho’s existing child-to-staff ratios are the 41st lowest in the nation, compared to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, a report by Idaho Voices for Children found. In other words, Idaho’s existing state-set child care standards let individual staffers care for more children at a given time than most states. 
The new law will leave Idaho with the 45th least stringent child-to-staff ratios in the nation, Idaho Voices for Children Executive Director Christine Tiddens previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.
The law takes effect July 1.
 Idaho’s death penalty now extends to some child sex abuse cases

Little signed into law on Wednesday a bill to make people who sexually abuse young children in Idaho eligible for the death penalty. 
House Bill 380 will allow the death penalty in a new criminal charge the bill creates: aggravated lewd conduct with children age 12 and younger.
The bill also would add mandatory minimum prison sentences for cases of aggravated lewd conduct with minors that don’t meet the bill’s proposed criteria for death penalty eligibility. The new crime would only apply to abuse of children age 16 and below. 
Little signed the bill Wednesday morning, according to the governor’s office legislation tracker. He told the Idaho Capital Sun in a written statement that he signed the bill “because heinous sex crimes against children destroy lives, and the perpetrators deserve the ultimate punishment.”
The law takes effect July 1.
 Governor also signs media shield law

Idaho will become the 41st state with a media shield law, which protects sources who provide confidential information or documents to journalists.
Little signed House Bill 158 into law Thursday after it passed the full Legislature unanimously, following a rise in legal threats across the state that sought to force journalists to reveal their sources. 
Idaho is one of 10 states without a journalism shield law, according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
The new law takes effect July 1.

(Courtesy of Jim Jones) March 29 is Vietnam War Veterans Day, the day set aside to remember and honor those who served in that ill-fated war. 
A phone call earlier this month brought to mind a perfect example of what dedicated service-to-country looks like. My friend, James Peterson, called to say that he would be undergoing surgery for a dangerous cancer, likely the result of his substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours of service with the Special Forces in Vietnam. 
It hit me hard because here was a man who had dedicated his life to standing up for his country and now was faced with a hefty price.
I met James in August 2006 at the 40th reunion of the Twin Falls High School’s Class of 1966 (my wife, Kelly, is a member of the class). We were at the City Park, refurbishing the memorial dedicated on Memorial Day in 1967 to those from Twin Falls County who died in the war. 
Seventeen names, starting with Major James H. Allred in 1963 and ending with PFC Fred S. Smart in 1970, were eventually placed on the memorial plaque. James spent many hours over the years, helping to keep up the memorial. 
In that initial conversation, we established that we’d both been stationed in Tay Ninh Province in 1968 – he at the Thien Ngon Special Forces camp 71 miles northwest of Saigon and me with a heavy artillery unit near Tay Ninh City. 
The strangest thing happened when I mentioned that, as an aerial artillery spotter, I’d destroyed a river bridge south of Thien Ngon that enemy fighters used to transport weapons and supplies. James went to his car, opened the trunk, and brought back a picture of that very bridge. We bonded immediately.

It was not until years later we pieced together the fact that we had likely met at the Thien Ngon Special Forces camp on Sept. 30, 1968. He was the communications specialist at the camp; the Special Forcecs commander for the Province was flying me around to introduce me to the artillery customers I would be serving. 
The Thien Ngon camp was in extremely hostile territory. Two days previously, it had been ferociously attacked by an estimated two battalions of North Vietnamese soldiers. The scars of the battle were still evident.
As Stars and Stripes described the battle, the Communists fired about 1,000 rockets, mortar rounds and grenades into the relatively small camp, then suffered 130 dead in trying but failing to overrun it. The six companies of Vietnamese defenders suffered four dead. Thirteen were wounded, including four Special Forces advisers. 
James was not one of them. James described the event as just business as usual those many years later.
James’ service to the country did not stop there. Although I never asked him how he used his remarkable communication skills during the next several decades and he never explained, I have the abiding feeling he kept serving the country in a clandestine capacity. 
He commented in one reunion booklet that he’d had the “opportunity to work in communications and other fields and live in so many different countries both friendly and unfriendly.” James lived in The Bahamas for 19 years on his catamaran “Bifrost” until it was destroyed in a hurricane in 2019.
James made frequent visits to the Boise VA Medical Center for a variety of conditions related to his service. Having been a gung-ho parachute jumper in his Army days (and perhaps in his later endeavors), his lower extremities needed frequent medical care. For a while, he parked a camp trailer on one of the two camper lots at the facility. He was and is a big fan of the VA Medical Center.
We spoke after his recent surgery and he reported doing well. He has three daughters and one son, 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. He should have plenty of time and opportunity with them in this final chapter of his life to make up for his numerous years of dedicated service to his country.
In everything James has done, he has shunned publicity and recognition by way of medals, decorations and the like. He would be rather unhappy to know that I’m paying this tribute to his life of service. However, I can’t think of a better person to remember on Vietnam War Veterans Day than James Peterson, who came from tough beginnings to be a true patriot and fine example. 
Thanks, Brother.

A pair of Omaha state senators on Friday laid out their respective bills to the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, both saying they were open to tweaks that would help green light the measures.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“We have had too many people die on roads, and I am interested in making this work,” State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington during a public hearing at the Capitol. “Let’s figure out a way.”
 Record pace

Nebraska had 251 traffic fatalities in 2024, the highest single-year total since 2007, which had 256, according to the Nebraska Department of Transportation.
DeBoer’s Legislative Bill 600 in part would give the Transportation Department the power to set up speed-detecting systems in highway work zones and to lower speed limits in dangerous areas.
Legislative Bill 616, introduced by State Sen. John Cavanaugh, would authorize the use of automated license plate reader cameras for red light violations and provides for civil enforcement.
Cavanaugh said his goal was to create a noncriminal way to deter reckless driving on city streets. A violation would result in a civil fee that could be waived if the driver participated in a no-cost safety program he called a “rehabilitative stop” class.
Any fees paid by those who choose not to take the class would help cover someone else taking the class, he said. 
No points would be assessed against the violator’s driver’s license. No warrant would be issued. If someone failed to pay the fee or complete the class, a charge would be assessed as a condition of renewing the vehicle’s registration. 
Any evidence or information obtained from the camera is not to be used for any purpose other than that particular statute.
  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“Someone is not going to find themself incarcerated as a result of a red light camera,” Cavanaugh said, adding that the threat of jail should not be the only way to improve public safety.
Acknowledging that the bill needs work, Cavanaugh, a lawyer, chuckled that a pair of typically at-odds parties were unified in their objection to his bill. “That’s a real accomplishment,” he said of the alliance between the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Nebraska Sheriffs Association. 
 ‘Harvest, collect and sell’ 

Bryan Waugh, the Kearney police chief, spoke on behalf of the Nebraska Sheriffs and Police Associations. He said cameras can be helpful in fighting violent and property crime and in alerts for missing persons — and said his city has 28 in use.
But Waugh does not think they are intended for “minor traffic or parking violations.”
“While we appreciate the focus on traffic safety, we believe intermingling this technology for traffic enforcement may negatively impact the effective use of the technology for crime prevention, solving crime and keeping the community safe from crime,” he said.
Waugh said his research shows that cameras targeting red light runners could increase the likelihood of a traffic collision, if people slam on their brakes to avoid getting caught.

Spike Eickholt, representing the ACLU and the Nebraska Criminal Defense Attorneys Association, expressed concerns about license plate reader companies and how they “harvest, collect and sell” license plate data.
His bigger worry, he said, is that traffic infractions in Nebraska are criminal in nature and that those charged or cited have rights, including to a trial.
“I don’t think that the Legislature can make something that is criminal, civil, just due to the enforcement mechanism that happens to be different than an officer actually observing a red light violation and writing a citation,” Eickholt said.
 Behavioral change

Supporters of the change included Timothy Adams, an engineer specializing in roadway safety. He told the committee that 80 people died in the Lincoln and Omaha areas alone at signalized intersections over the past five years.
“These cameras serve as a strong deterrent leading to long term behavioral changes that make our roads safe.”
DeBoer said a multifaceted LB 600 aims to improve safety around highway worker construction areas and at-risk spots and intersections.
As written, DeBoer said, the law would empower the Transportation Department to assess administrative civil penalties to the registered owner of a vehicle recorded by special technology traveling at excessive speed through a marked area. 
For a highway work zone, that threshold would be eleven miles per hour or more over the speed limit. The first offense would be a warning. A second offense within three years would be $75. She said she is open to considering a criminal violation route.
 17-year high 

  Vicki Kramer, director of the Nebraska Department of Transportation. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Vicki Kramer, director of the state Department of Transportation, supported the bill.
She told the committee that in 2024, Nebraska’s roadway fatality count spiked to a 17-year high, despite national statistics for crashes trending down. She said that motivated the department to research counter measures. Among the department’s recommendations, she said, were speed safety cameras or devices in work areas and variable speed limits in danger zones.
“The provisions are not intended to generate revenue, but to influence driver behavior,” she said.
The Judiciary Committee did not take action on either bill.

In an effort to keep up, and keep you all informed, Maine Morning Star is restarting our weekly round-up of notable votes and other actions, particularly those we may not have been able to cover elsewhere. 
Arguably the biggest thing that transpired this week is Gov. Janet Mills officially reconvened the Legislature after the House and Senate voted to adjourn shortly after midnight last Friday in a procedural move that will start the clock to make the funds in the continuing services budget available in 90 days.
However, Republican members of the House argued the reconvening amounted to an “illegal session,” as Rep. Shelley Rudnicki of Fairfield put it during Tuesday’s session. A motion to “adjourn without day,” or without a plan to reconvene, failed 68-77.
The reconvening also prompted discussion in the House Tuesday about whether the censure of Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) would continue. An effort to end the censure failed in a 68-76 vote.
The drama continued into Thursday when Rudnicki introduced an order to censure House Speaker Ryan Fecteau over what she said were breaches in the House rules. That effort split Republicans, ultimately failing 24-119.
Full Legislature
Both the House and Senate have now voted against LD 234, a Republican-led effort to eliminate ranked choice voting. The Senate voted 20-14 in favor of the Judiciary Committee’s recommendation against the bill following the 76-66 vote in the House.
Over the objection of some Republicans that the votes amounted to a “waste of taxpayer money,” and some questions about the difference between the two animal classes, House and Senate backed proposals to designate the wood turtle as the official state reptile (LD 73) and the spring peeper as the official state amphibian (LD 72).
The House and Senate also supported the Education Committee’s recommendation to pass LD 74, which would extend the system of learning results review from five to seven years. 
Lawmakers rejected a bill (LD 444), sponsored by Libby, that would repeal the law setting out the state’s goals for consumption of electricity from renewable resources. Members backed the committee recommendation against the bill 78-65 in the House and 20-13 in the Senate.
The House and Senate both voted under the hammer to reject a bill (LD 387) sponsored by Republican leadership in the House and Senate that would prohibit the governor from “relocat[ing] illegal immigrants into this State or take any other actions intended to authorize, approve or otherwise assist in the relocation or transportation of illegal immigrants into this State.” However, the House sponsor said this action was recommended because there is another similar bill also being considered they plan to support.
Senate votes
On Thursday, the Senate unanimously voted to confirm Michael Duguay, Gov. Janet Mills’ pick to head the Department of Economic and Community Development. 
The Senate also unanimously confirmed the appointment of Amy Dieterich of Auburn as a district court Judge and the reappointment of Honorable Matthew G. Tice of Scarborough for reappointment as a district court judge.
The Senate voted “under the hammer,” meaning without roll call, to back several bills, including: LD 586, “An Act to Provide a Court Authority to Issue Proximity Restrictions in Protection from Abuse Orders;” LD 466, an emergency bill to extend the law governing electric power and service residential rates for military veterans’ organizations; LD 254, “An Act to Designate November as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month;” LD 683 “An Act to Clarify the Law Governing the Minimum Indirect Financial Interest Disclosure Requirement for Liquor Licenses.”
These all now head to the House.

Who the hell asked for this?
That was my response as yet another session of the Kansas Legislature wrapped up Thursday, with lawmakers setting up future fiscal calamity, sticking their noses in national political issues and generally trying to hightail it out of town before the satanists descended.
Each year, Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith and I discuss the character of the session. We chat about the throughlines, the issues, the character. Each year, as you might imagine, varies. Some focus on taxes, others on issues like education or abortion.
What made the 2025 session so unusual, Smith and I agreed, was the extent to which it didn’t have a driving story.
Legislators made a mess of process, closing caucus meetings and rushing through an unprecedentedly short calendar. They pushed through fiscally and morally reprehensible legislation. But at the end of it, as 125 representatives and 40 senators made a mad dash for home, I was left confused.
What did they mean to do? What was the theme, the purpose, the goal?
Sure, they wanted to make the rich richer and leave the poor to rot. That’s always the case. Sure, they demonized trans people and immigrants.
But why? We heard little from House Speaker Dan Hawkins or Senate President Ty Masterson explaining their stances or outlining their path to prosperity. They simply wielded power and plowed through bills.
Perhaps they meant to set up Masterson’s possible gubernatorial bid.
Perhaps they meant to leave Gov. Laura Kelly with a fresh budget crisis when new revenue estimates arrive.
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
My take? I don’t think we’ve seen or heard the last of this session. Sure, members will return for a veto session on April 10. But I think there are more stories to be told and more to be learned about what went down this year. As too many characters in the Star Wars universe say: I have a bad feeling about this.
 
  House Republican lawmakers met behind closed doors on March 18, 2025 (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Closed caucus
On Monday, I wrote about House Republicans closing their caucus meetings for the session.
You might expect such an embarrassing story to generate statements of regret or indignant denials from lawmakers. Instead, House Republicans said absolutely nothing, which suggests 1.) that the column was accurate in all particulars and 2.) they were mortified about it.
Not a word from House Majority Leader Chris Croft, either, despite my repeated attempts to contact him. He sets the policy, so there we go.
Lawmakers might be interested to know who I did hear from: readers.
That’s right, Kansas voters were quite interested to hear about the closed meetings. They left dozens of comments under our Facebook post about the story, and a good number send me email messages asking about the situation.
I plan to write more about the closed meetings. After all, everyone comes back to the Statehouse next month. We’ll see what they do then.
 
Proctor poppycock
The one and only Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, has touted discredited election conspiracies for years.
But I was taken with this recent Twitter post from the representative.

There is nothing more fundamental to our form of government than voter confidence that the results of elections reflect their will. As your House Elections Chair, I’m fighting to fix vulnerabilities in our election system to restore voter confidence–before it’s too late.#ksleg pic.twitter.com/2Q5QV4RgPd

My question to Proctor — I left it as a response tweet as well — is a simple one. What does he mean by writing “before it’s too late”?
Before insurrectionists attempt to overthrow our duly elected president on Jan. 6, 2021? Pretty sure that already happened.
Before deciding to spread doubt and confusion over perfectly legitimate elections administered by a succession of Republican secretaries of state? Pretty sure that already happened as well.
Or does he simply mean before a group of overcaffeinated ideological fanatics decide to do away with elections altogether and install their choice as president or governor? Why aren’t decades of free and fair elections enough for Proctor and his ilk?
Sadly, Proctor didn’t respond to my question. I should have said I needed his answer before it was too late.

Questions teem
Let’s delve into one more batch of legislative questions for this decidedly unmagical March.

Kansas lawmakers broke their promise to add $73 million in special education funding. What other promises will they break next month?
How many satanic activities by satanists at the Statehouse need to occur before we all just realize we like saying the word “satanic” a lot?
What seemingly dead legislation will shudder back to life during the supposed “veto session” next month? I bet folks won’t like it!
Did anyone else notice that hearings against Rep. Ford Carr, D-Wichita, magically stopped after gaining statewide attention and a crowd showed up to protest?

 
Opinion deportation
In the world of opinion journalism this week, I couldn’t help but follow news about Tufts graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was arrested and detained by the Trump administration. Officials want to deport the Turkish grad student, who has legal status.
According to supporters, Ozturk’s offense appears to be writing an op-ed for The Tufts Daily titled “Try again, President Kumar: Renewing calls for Tufts to adopt March 4 TCU Senate resolutions.” (Read the column if you’d like, but I warn you that it’s dry and not particularly interesting.)
Perhaps the administration has further evidence in the case. But if not, I don’t see how such detention can be defended.
The First Amendment forms one of the bedrocks of our democratic republic. Its protections should extend to visa holders, immigrants without legal status or random visitors to this country. Threatening deportation for exercising free speech takes jackhammer to that bedrock. It’s outright 1984 territory.
 
Press box phenomenon
You’d like to think Hawkins would have finally seen the error of his ways in the closing days of the session and allowed journalists to return to the press box in his chamber.
He didn’t.
But as a gift to the speaker and his staff, I’d like to offer two photos from Smith. The first comes from when he entered the back of the chamber. You might notice that the press box mentioned above sits empty. Gosh, it would be so nice if a few journalists could sit there, no?

A few minutes in, the House speaker appears to have noticed Smith’s presence. Soon after, House staffers filtered out to sit behind the press box. It’s a session miracle!
  A few minutes later, House staffers have taken their places in the press box, supposedly showing how little room remains for journalists. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
As the Statehouse goes on hiatus the next couple of weeks, so will Statehouse scraps. I’ll return when lawmakers do!

(Courtesy of Lincoln Electric System)I often oppose new wind and solar energy projects in Nebraska. I’ve appeared in opposition to proposals in Cass, Knox, Lancaster, Saunders and York Counties.
As an attorney, I represent Knox County and a group of Lancaster County landowners. I regularly address the Omaha Public Power District board regarding its foolish net-zero policy.
I am opposed to wind and solar for many reasons, but the main reason is economics. I do, however, agree with the Amish farmer who spoke in opposition to a solar project that was rejected in Knox County. He said, “I don’t think it is a good idea to build a business based on a fad.”
Tax credits tilt playing field
Wind and solar are all about the federal income tax credits. That’s it. Goldman Sachs projected $1.2 trillion in federal payments for renewable energy projects through 2032.
It has little to do with saving the planet. For wind and solar proponents, there is certainly an element of virtue signaling to show others how much they care about the future of mankind.
I’ve long been of the opinion that the theory of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is a scam. It is based on corrupt data that is fed into faulty models by people who have a financial bias in the result.
It is a prediction about the entire climate of the planet in the distant future, a prediction unlikely to be accurate.
Adam Smith created the academic discipline of economics with his “The Wealth of Nations.” In that book, he proved the economic law of natural advantage.
Nebraska has other advantages
The natural advantage of Nebraska is the efficient production of food. Oklahoma and Texas, on the other hand, have the natural advantage of efficient oil and natural gas production.
Nebraska trades food for oil and natural gas with other states. Both states benefit. This is how the United States has become the wealthiest nation in the world.
Gov. Jim Pillen is aware that it is not possible to create additional acres of Nebraska farmland. That’s part of why he has opposed putting solar panels on productive Nebraska ag land.
It is true that participating landowners get three to five times the cash rent for their land to let these projects happen. But many landowners reject the offer because they value something more than the almighty dollar.
I saw neighbors pitted against neighbors in Cass County. I also saw a woman cry before a legislative hearing after she recited the facts of disappearing farmland.
Debt matters
Our country is $37 trillion in debt. For every dollar spent on an approved wind, solar and battery project, the developer gets a significant slice of federal money.
We all pay for the federal debt, even those landowners who get windfall cash rents from renewable energy developers. The other point that I repeatedly make is that as wind and solar are added to the electric grid, electricity prices increase.
Over 50% of Germany’s electricity comes from renewable sources. That’s why Germany’s electricity is three to four times more expensive than the U.S. average. That’s also why Germany’s industrial base has been declining. The economics don’t work.
The OPPD board has been informed about economic studies done by the Center of the American Experiment regarding net-zero policies in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The studies show that electric rates will triple and that there could be forced blackouts in the dead of winter.
The essential problem is that solar and wind are intermittent power sources, but electricity demand is constant. Nebraska’s public power districts are required, by law, to produce only reliable power. Only dispatchable power is reliable.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/03/29/house-members-overhaul-moore-housing-bill-with-simpler-amendments/,"Lawmakers are scrambling to push through a heavily amended version of Gov. Wes Moore's (D) priority ""Housing for Jobs Act,"" which may be the governor's bill in name only at this point.","Houses and businesses lining the streets of Annapolis on March 24, 2025. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).Lawmakers are scrambling to push through a heavily amended version of Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) priority “Housing for Jobs Act,” which may be the governor’s bill in name only at this point.
The bill that originally would have tied increased housing development to job growth in the state now calls for studies, the setting of housing goals and limited guarantees for developers.
The House Environment and Transportation Committee approved the amended version of the House Bill 503 Friday and will send it to the full House next week, when there will be just a week left in the session. The Senate is waiting for the House bill.
“This was the path forward that we found, and I think will provide meaningful changes while also setting, hopefully, a roadmap to the future to make even more meaningful changes,” Del. Dylan Behler (D-Anne Arundel), a member of the committee, said this week. “I know that there were a lot of conversations [between] … the governor’s office and other groups that care deeply about this and focus on lowering the cost of housing for Marylanders.”
With clock ticking, lawmakers still hope to iron out issues on Moore’s housing bill

Despite the changes, the Moore administration said in a statement that it’s “proud” of the amended bill and will “continue to work with legislative partners to pass it into law.”
“Maryland is facing a housing supply and affordability crisis and this legislation directly addresses it by creating regulatory certainty for housing production in Maryland,” the administration statement said.
When introduced, the governor’s bill was framed as an expansion on his housing package from last year. The original version aimed to expedite housing development by requiring counties to automatically approve most qualifying project requests if the state determines there is an imbalance between housing and jobs in the county.
Representatives from the Maryland Association of Counties quickly expressed “significant” concerns over the bill, particularly the language that would have forced counties to approve housing in some situations. MACo officials said in a recent statement that the bill is now more “streamlined” and that many of its initial concerns have been addressed.
Now, the bill creates a housing commission to study the state’s housing crisis and make recommendations to address the lack of affordable units in the state. It also calls on the state’s housing secretary to set a 10-year target for housing production in the state, while creating create subtargets for specific regions in consultation with county governments.
The bill also sets up “vesting rights” for developers, meaning that they would have a guarantee for five years that they can build on a property once a project is approved, and ensures that the developer is governed by the laws and policies issued at the time of a projects application.
MACo Executive Director Michael Sanderson believes the current, “simpler” version of the bill will have an easier time navigating the remaining legislative hurdles than the initial language. He said the administration bill was not helped by the fact that it did not get a hearing until March.

“It’s just kind of unfortunate that this ended up being one of the bills that got a late hearing. Maybe if this whole process had started on Valentine’s day instead of March … we might have been further along,” Sanderson said.
He added that the amendments narrow the goal of the bill to the “essential elements that they (the administration) think could move the needle the most.”
“Nobody loves the idea of a task force or a commission as a resolution,” Sanderson said, “but sometimes on big issues, having the forum where you go hash this stuff out, that might be a more productive way.”
There is a Senate version of the legislation, Senate Bill 430, but Education, Energy, and the Environment Chair Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery) said he is waiting to see how the House settles the bill before the legislation moves in the Senate.
Housing Secretary Jake Day said that despite the language overhaul, the bill still incorporates an overarching goal of improving housing supply in areas that need it.
“I am grateful now that it seems like we are at a place where this can move, and I think many of the most important concepts remain intact — and look to me like they are going to move forward,” Day said. “I know we’re nearing the end, but … I still think it’s a bill that can move the needle on housing production and housing affordability.”

Citing the complete language overhaul, Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore) said the initial bill language was “clearly not ready for primetime.”
“It says to me that the bill was a flawed bill as it came to the committee, if we’re kind of rewriting the whole bill through amendments,” he said. “The significant rewrite … is the committee also acknowledging that there were serious flaws with that initial version of the bill.”
Nawrocki voted against the bill during Friday’s voting session, noting that he had some “heartburn” on the new vesting rights language, which could be a point of contention as it moves through the legislative process. But it still received overall approval in the House committee.
Day hopes that the bill passed this year will inform additional housing legislation in future sessions to help tackle the affordability crisis in the state.
“We’ll have to see what gets passed this year,” Day said. “Time is of the essence, and housing isn’t getting cheaper … We’ve got a lot of work to do on production. I think what comes back in future years really depends on the progress that is made this year.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC01957-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 03:00:52.026229

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)After an hour of robust debate, a Senate committee advanced a House bill Friday that would let some long-serving incarcerated individuals to ask a judge for a second chance at life.
By an 8-3 vote, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee approved the Second Look Act, which would let individuals who have served at least 20 years in prison petition for a reduced sentence.
The bill sponsored by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) passed the House on March 17. Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) sponsored a version in his chamber, but the Senate will work off Pasteur’s bill.
A similar bill passed the Senate last year but stalled in the House.
This year’s bill would apply to anyone sentenced for a crime committed between the ages of 18 and 25, who has served at least 20 years of their sentence. Those incarcerated would need to wait five years to petition the court again if they were turned down the first time, and those sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or a convicted “sex offender” would not be eligible.
Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore and Carroll) said he has reservations about the age restrictions — those 18 to 25 should know right from wrong, he said — but he still voted in favor of it.

“Many will call, many will knock on the door, but not that many will be let out by the judge because it all depends on what you’ve done in the intervening 20 years,” West said after the Senate adjourned Friday afternoon.
“Does the judge really believe that you’ve reformed and you’re longer a threat to society? I think we need to give them [those incarcerated] some consideration,” he said.
Others worried that the bill would give a second chance to individuals charged with murder and other violent crimes.
“I would probably support this bill if it took out murder … and some of the violent crimes,” said Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford), who voted against the bill in committee. “That’s where I think it’s a bridge too far.”
Supporters of the bill have stressed this “isn’t a get out of jail free card” because it doesn’t guarantee everyone incarcerated will be freed from prison.
The bill would apply to an estimated 350 people. If a court decides to grant parole, it can order the paroled individual to “stay away from and refrain from contact with a victim and victim’s family … unless the victim requests otherwise.”
A victim or a victim’s representative would be able to submit an impact statement to the court “regarding the impact of the crime and the proposed sentence reduction.” Those statements can “carry weight” in court, said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the committee, who voted in favor of the bill.
But Sen. Mike McKay (R-Garrett, Allegany and Washington) said the bill would simply “revictimize, revictimize, revictimize, revictimize.”
House grants final approval to Second Look Act, sends bill to the Senate

“I believe that we are in the business of correcting and rehabilitating people, but not at the expense of increasing the amount of time to revictimize,” McKay said before he voted against the bill.
Sydnor, who voted for the bill, said it attempts to strike a balance for victims and rehabilitation.
“This bill is really about mercy and grace for someone who has been incarcerated for a minimum of 20 years and who has shown or demonstrated that they have rehabilitated themselves,” he said. “It’s just a second look. Judges aren’t being forced to release anyone.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) cited families such as Richard and Dawn Collins, who traveled to Annapolis in January to testify against the bill on behalf of their son, Richard W. Collins III. He was visiting a friend at the University of Maryland, College Park, when he was fatally stabbed in a racially motivated hate crime in May 2017. The stabbing took place a few days before he was set to graduate from Bowie State University, where he was in the Army ROTC.
“This bill would undermine the small justice and the loss of her [Dawn Collins] up-and-coming second lieutenant son, going to make a difference,” said Folden, who voted against the measure.
Folden said Richard “told his mother the world would know his name. We know his name because his parents come down here and advocate on his behalf because he’s no longer here.”
Meanwhile, the bill’s racial equity impact note notes that incarcerated Black prisoners could receive the most benefit.
As of Jan. 1, the state Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services reported that 12,675, or 72%, of those incarcerated in the state’s prisons are Black; the state’s Black residents accounted for 31.6% of the state’s overall population in 2023.
Of the total 17,586 individuals incarcerated in the state, about 1,303 are serving life sentences and 331 are those without the possibility of parole.
“Black inmates would experience the most significant impact given their overrepresentation in the State’s incarcerated population,” according to the note.
The full Senate could debate the measure sometime next week. It would have to act before April 7, the last day of the legislative session.

(Photo by Dave Palmer/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)That potential electric bill refund being touted by legislative leaders as part of a larger energy reform package? It could amount to an average of $81 per household, according to legislative analysts.
The provision is one of a laundry list of energy reforms included in legislation that passed unanimously in a Senate committee this week, including language that would expedite the construction of new nuclear energy and — possibly — natural gas power plants in Maryland.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) held up the rebate as the quickest remedy legislators can provide for Marylanders’ utility bill sticker shock.
“The goal was to have a short-term impact, a mid-term impact and a long-term impact and that’s what this energy leadership package really represents,” Ferguson said Friday.
The plan is to use about $200 million from the Maryland Energy Administration’s Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is typically used for energy efficiency projects, Ferguson said.
Each household’s exact refund would depend on their energy usage, and the payment would arrive in two parts in fiscal 2026: Once during the peak summer season and again during winter.
Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) said Friday, after voting in favor of the bill in committee, that she remains concerned that there is no “litmus test” determining which Marylanders ought to be compensated.
“My concern is that someone in a megamansion is going to get a whole lot of money, and someone who’s trying to pinch their pennies will get a paltry amount, but have a greater need,” Kagan said.
But Ferguson said that offering the refund across the board, and basing it on energy usage, was seen as the best way to reach not just low-income ratepayers — who can take advantage of other programs to help with electric bills — but also the middle class.
“We’re really concerned for those who are not eligible for the lowest-income funds, but were not wealthy, and that middle gap is really feeling the pinch,” Ferguson said.
The SEIF funds actually come from the utilities themselves, which can make “alternative compliance payments” when they haven’t purchased enough renewable energy to comply with state mandates.
In fiscal 2024, utilities contributed $318 million to the SEIF fund. It was a large amount relative to prior years, because the alternative compliance fees became less expensive than actual renewable energy credits.
Normally, the funding would go to projects meant to fill in the gap, such as HVAC replacements, lighting upgrades and solar panel installations.
If approved, the refunds would appear on Marylanders’ utility bills as a “Legislative Energy Hardship Credit.” But some legislators want to go back to the drawing board.
Sen. Ronald L. Watson (D-Prince George’s) said Thursday that the name ought to be changed to “consumer relief payment,” or something similar.
“It’s not a legislative hardship,” Watson said. “No, we are reimbursing ratepayers who have paid too much for far too long, and trying to give them something back twice in one year.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/4277388-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 03:00:52.026229

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s top elections administrator said he is “disheartened” by a presidential executive order that could dramatically change elections.
President Donald Trump imposed sweeping changes Wednesday to elections in an executive order. Included in those are calls for voters to prove they are U.S. citizens in order to register to vote and Election Day deadlines for returning mail-in ballots.
Maryland State Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis, in a statement, said the state board “is committed to protecting voters from undue harassment or intimidation regarding when and how they voted. Voting is a protected right that was fought for during the course of our county’s history. The struggle to vote was not easy and must always be protected. Harassment and intimidation not only occurs during times of voting but can take place after the election under different guises.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Maryland adopted a broad mail-in voting program that lets anyone cast a ballot by mail without having to justify the request. Before 2020, voters could only vote by mail — called absentee balloting — under certain circumstances. Residents overseas, including those in the military, were also eligible. All that changed during the pandemic.
DeMarinis said his office is “analyzing the impact of the Executive Order on our military and overseas voters as well as our domestic ones. Mail-in ballots cast and postmarked before or on Election Day are legal ballots that must be counted. Those voters’ voices must be heard. Claiming that the method in which the ballot was cast somehow invalidates the vote is misinformation and the record must be corrected.”
The elections administrator said Trump’s order ignored modern threats to election integrity.
“I am disheartened that the Executive Order did not mention mis/dis or malinformation especially from foreign influences,” DeMarinis’ staetment said. “The rapid pace of technology has allowed some dis/misinformation to deter participation as well as harm faith in our election results.”
As long as we’re bashing Trump executive orders …
Maryland Democrats lined up Friday to attack Trump over another executive order, this one canceling collective bargaining rights for workers at scores of federal agencies.
It was one of 10 executive orders signed by the president this week alone, from attacking the Smithsonian Institution for its “divisive, race-centered ideology” to meddling in District affairs to continuing his fight with “Big Law,” reviewing security clearances and suppressing business with law firms he said “engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.” This week’s targets were WilmerHale and Jennings & Block.

	The “Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs” said that union representation is “dangerous in agencies with national security responsibilities” and that collective bargaining would be ended at agencies with national security missions. The White House then proceeded to give an extremely broad definition of agencies with national security mandates, including the Office of General Counsel at Health and Human Services (pandemic preparedness); the Federal Communications Commission (cybersecurity); the U.S. Agency for International Development (foreign affairs); the Environmental Protection Agency (energy security); and “most components of the Department of Public Safety and Federal Emergency Management Administration” (public safety), among others.
Curiously exempted from list of agencies with security responsibilities were police and firefighters’ unions, which have been generally supportive of Trump’s campaigns. They retained their collective bargaining rights.
Democrats were quick to reply. Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) said in a social media post that the “especially disappointed” to see the president “use the guise of national security to weaken union protections for nearly two-thirds of the entire federal workforce,” while Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) called it an attack on “hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have dedicated their lives to national security, public safety, and the well-being of all Americans.”
Gov. Wes Moore called it an extension of the administration’s attacks on federal workers, who have been laid off by the thousands in recent weeks. “These continued attacks on the federal workforce have already led to countless jobs lost, countless lives disrupted, and a drastic hit to Maryland’s economy,” Moore said in a statement, adding that the state would continue to fight for collective bargaining and workers’ rights.
Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) said, “Donald Trump’s Executive Order terminating union rights for hundreds of thousands of federal workers is destructive, very disturbing, and perhaps and probably, not perhaps, probably illegal.” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), in a social media post, called it “another illegal executive order, this time taking a chainsaw to unions and collective bargaining,” while Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) called it a “brazenly illegal attack on unions.”
The only GOP member of the state’s congressional delegation, Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), had not posted anything about the executive order as of Friday evening.
Blueprint paused, not really
Budget and Taxation Committee Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) calmly read 14 amendments from Senate Bill 429 that are part of the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan Friday. But instead of debating it then, senators asked that it be laid over — held for later action — until Monday.
Guzzone’s committee voted Wednesday on and amended the Senate version of the bill, but also voted to make the House of Delegates version approved earlier this month conform to the Senate version.
Some differences between the bills include a four-year pause in the phase-in of collaborative time for teachers. The Senate agreed with the pause first presented by Gov. Wes Moore (D). The House rejected it and chose to pause for one year.
House approves Blueprint education bill that rejects most cuts proposed by governor

The House also rejected the governor’s proposal on “foundation” funding, or per pupil spending. Under the Blueprint, it was slated to grow from $8,789 per pupil this year to $9,226 next fiscal year, but the administration proposed reducing the growth to $9,063 next year and slowing the pace of growth for several years after. The Senate committee agreed, but the House voted to keep the original Blueprint funding levels.
Another difference between the two chambers deals with the Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, part of the multibillion-dollar Blueprint plan that deals with mental health and other wraparound services for the students. The House chose to fund it at $40 million next year and each year after, but the Senate budgeted $70 million next year and then $100 million for fiscal year 2027 and beyond.
Because of the differences between both chambers, the House will likely reject the Senate plan and force a conference committee to be formed to hash out the differences before the final day of the legislative session April 7.
House approves delay to FAMLI benefit 
House members pushed forward a bill that would delay Marylanders’ access to guaranteed paid family and medical leave, a delay the Moore administration proposed in February amid what it called “huge instability and uncertainty” from the Trump administration.
Benefits from the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program are supposed to be available in 2026, but the House Bill 102 would move that start date back to 2028. The House voted 95-34 Friday for the bill which would not only impose the delay but also create an avenue in which self-employed individuals can partake in the benefit when it launches.
Faced with a $3 billion budget shortfall and rapid-fire policy decisions from the Trump administration, Maryland officials suggested pushing the start date for FAMLI back by 18 months, meaning that payroll collections for the benefit would begin Jan. 1, 2027, and benefits would become available on Jan. 1, 2028.

(Photo by Fiordaliso/Getty Stock Images)I got the phone call at 2:39 p.m. on Oct. 16, 2020. After four anxious days of waiting, I heard the voice on the line say, “I’m so sorry to tell you the tumor we found was malignant – you have cancer.”
As the person on the phone became a muffled “Peanuts”-esque voice, talking about oncology referrals and scheduling staging scans, I remember curling into a ball on my couch, alone with my cat, the room spinning as a myriad of rapid-fire thoughts ran through my head: “I’m only 37. I have cancer?! Am I going to die? How do I tell my parents? My family? Friends? Work? What treatments will I need? Surgery? Chemo? What do those cost? What will my insurance cover?”
With little warning, four days after a routine colonoscopy I had because of a family history of polyps, my life suddenly cleaved in two: Before and after my Stage 3 neuroendocrine cancer diagnosis.
As my brain started the first of countless doom spirals, I tried to accept my life-threatening diagnosis, but I was fortunate never to have to ponder, “Will I lose my job? Can I pay rent? Can I afford groceries?” Thanks to my large employer, I was among the lucky employees in Maryland with access to paid family and medical leave. Only 43% of the workforce have access to paid medical leave and even fewer have access to paid family leave.

I was fortunate to have the time off to confront my situation, but no one should have to rely on luck to fight for their survival or the well-being of their loved ones. That’s why we fought so hard to pass the Time to Care Act. In 2022, the Maryland General Assembly enacted it, creating a statewide Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program. A full 88% of Marylanders support this program, and the Maryland Department of Labor has been hard at work preparing to implement it.
Consequently, I am heartbroken by Gov. Wes Moore’s proposal to delay the implementation of the FAMLI program for an additional 18 months: an unconscionable amount of time for Marylanders who need time to care today.
When you are faced with a life-threatening diagnosis, you are quickly reminded that the future is a luxury. Delaying this vital program harms every Marylander with a serious illness, caregiving for a loved one facing the end of their life, or welcoming new family members.
These Marylanders might not have an additional 18 months to wait for benefits to begin Jan. 1, 2028. During this proposed delay, over 247,000 Marylanders who would have applied for benefits will instead have to make impossible decisions about which bills to forgo, decide if they should miss a day’s pay to sit at a parent’s bedside in hospice care or risk bodily harm by returning to work too soon after giving birth.
Everyone needs time to care, and I am a testament to the unpredictability of when you might need paid leave.
The proposed delay has been justified by “federal uncertainty,” but life doesn’t stop because of uncertainty. I was diagnosed with cancer during a worldwide pandemic but care couldn’t wait. No other state is delaying the implementation of its FAMLI program in response to the federal administration’s recent actions, and Maryland’s FAMLI program does not rely on federal funding.
Maryland was lauded as a national leader when it passed the Time to Care Act, but each year the implementation gets delayed and other states move ahead with starting their paid leave programs, Maryland gets left behind.
By keeping the FAMLI program on its current implementation timeline, the Moore-Miller administration can provide certainty to Marylanders facing the uncertainty of a life-threatening illness that they won’t lose their income while navigating their care.
As a cancer survivor, I believe when facing an uncertain future you center your values, you stand beside each other, and you do the next right thing even if you can’t see far into the distance. We may not be able to predict everything the future will bring, but the next right thing is for Maryland to hold fast to its values by keeping the FAMLI program on its current implementation timeline.
Marylanders should feel secure in knowing that facing life’s best and most challenging times won’t also create an economic tragedy. We can’t delay promised progress because of the fear of some undefined uncertainty. Now is the moment to champion the timely implementation of FAMLI leave in Maryland.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1428788053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-29 03:00:52.026229

Federal immigration officials have moved a University of Alabama graduate student to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Jena, Louisiana.
An attorney for Alireza Doroudi confirmed Friday afternoon after the ICE detainee locator listed where he was detained. For several days, the detainee locator only stated he was “in ICE custody” but did not list any location. The facility in Jena is holding several international students targeted by federal authorities.
David Rozas, Doroudi’s attorney, disputed claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that his client posed a national security concern.

Doroudi, an Iranian national pursuing a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, was taken into custody by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit around 3 a.m. Tuesday, Rozas said in a statement sent on Friday. Immigration authorities cited the U.S. State Department’s revocation of Doroudi’s student visa as the reason for his arrest.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Doroudi “posed significant national security concerns.” The spokesperson declined to provide further details about what the concerns were, saying “That is all we are able to share at this time.”
Rozas challenged that characterization, saying he was unaware “of any allegations concerning significant national security issues.”
“He has not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests,” the statement from Rozas said. “He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering.”
Rozas added that Doroudi’s student visa was still active and that he was in the early stages of applying for permanent residency as a researcher.
Student organizers from the Students for Justice in Palestine, a student organization at UA, said Thursday that Doroudi had no involvement in recent pro-Palestine protests at the university or with the organization.
Doroudi’s fiancé, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal expenses, garnering over $21,000 in about a day. She said in a LinkedIn post that Doroudi’s is set to defend his dissertation next academic year and has been “fully engaged” in academic work and research projects in the department.
“His dedication and achievements have earned him recognition in his field and led to his selection to apply for permanent residency,” she wrote in a post.
The University of Alabama has not provided further details about the situation. Spokesperson Alex House did not respond to messages Friday after initially stating that the university was cooperating with immigration authorities. House did not address whether the university was offering Doroudi any assistance.

(Photo by Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.
The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
 Withholding tribes’ data

As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”
Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.
Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
 State data agreements

In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”
A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
 Tracking disease

In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
 ‘We needed this yesterday’

During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”
There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal judge dismissed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to shutter the Dakota Access Pipeline, finding that the tribe must wait until the Army Corps finishes a key environmental study to bring another legal challenge against the agency.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a Friday order.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, arguing that Corps is violating federal law by allowing the pipeline to operate without an easement. The tribe also claimed that the Corps failed to properly study the environmental impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline or require its developer to prepare adequate spill response plans, among other alleged violations.
The suit is a successor to a lawsuit the tribe filed against the same agency in 2016.
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

In that case, Boasberg in 2020 found the Army Corps had violated federal law by not conducting a full environmental impact study before granting an easement allowing the pipeline to cross underneath the Missouri River. He pulled the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be drained of oil pending the Army Corps’ completion of the study.
An appellate court in 2021 reversed Boasberg’s decision to shut down the pipeline, but did not reinstate the easement.
Boasberg wrote in a 2021 order following that decision that he could not shutter the pipeline because the tribe hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that it posed an immediate threat of irreparable harm.
He noted in his Friday memo that “remarkably little” has changed in the four years since.
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends,” Boasberg wrote at the beginning of the order, quoting Shakespeare’s “Henry V”.
The Army Corps still has not finished the environmental impact study. It published a draft version of its report in late 2023. Once the study is complete, the Army Corps will use it to decide whether to grant the easement again.
One of the main arguments the tribe made in its 2024 lawsuit is that the Army Corps’ yearslong inaction on the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of federal law.
Boasberg wrote previously that, given the pipeline is operating on Army Corps land without proper authorization, the agency in the interim could have done something to enforce its property rights.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in his 2021 order.
But the Army Corps for now is not legally required to do anything but finish the environmental impact study, Boasberg stated in the Friday memo.
He said that other arguments Standing Rock raised in its complaint seek to relitigate issues that were already decided in the 2016 case, and that the legal landscape is not likely to change until the study is completed.
Boasberg noted that Standing Rock can file another lawsuit against the Corps once the study is published. The Army Corps of Engineers in legal filings also argued the tribe cannot sue the Corps over the easement when it had not yet made a final decision on the permit.
The tribe indicated last fall that it had new evidence to present related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
North Dakota, other states and pipeline owner Dakota Access intervened in the lawsuit on the side of the Corps. The intervenors called on the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the pipeline is important to the country’s economy, and that shutting it down would violate states’ rights and make road and rail transit less safe.
“The Dakota Access Pipeline has been operating safely for almost eight years now and is a critical piece of infrastructure for North Dakota and our nation’s energy security,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement regarding Boasberg’s decision.
A spokesperson for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment.
“The Corps has failed to act and failed to protect the tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in an October press conference announcing the lawsuit.
The pipeline, which spans more than 1,000 miles, carries crude oil from northwest North Dakota to Illinois. Its pathway includes unceded land recognized as the Sioux Nation’s in 19th century treaties signed by the U.S. government.

Fourteen incumbent Republican lawmakers lost in the 2024 primaries, with many challengers capitalizing on opposition to Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed multibillion-dollar pipeline project. That produced a large class of freshman Republican legislators, and last year’s Republican leadership group lost support, resulting in a new leadership team when the Legislature convened in January.
Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, said those changes produced bills that pitted Republicans against each other, leading Democrats and some Republicans to work together against legislation they both opposed. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Legislature 96-9.
“Unfortunately this year, a lot of times it was killing bad bills that we were the most successful,” Smith said.

Rep. Drew Peterson, R-Salem, said he ran for a caucus leadership position ahead of the session but “lost by a few.” He said some Republicans who failed to gain a leadership post worked with Democrats on some issues.
“I wasn’t in leadership this year, but we still lead within our group,” Peterson said. “Collectively we could get 36 to 42 votes between the Democrats and Republicans, and we did our job.”
Peterson and Smith were among the lawmakers who participated in a legislative panel discussion at the annual conference hosted by the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota.
As evidence of bipartisan efforts between Democrats and some Republicans, the lawmakers highlighted the amending of legislation dubbed the “locking up librarians” bill, by removing a proposed criminal penalty for distributing harmful or obscene material to minors and instead requiring an appeals process for challenging materials in school and public libraries. The amendment passed the Senate 18-16 before the bill passed the chamber 32-2. The House accepted the amendments in a 36-34 vote, and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the bill this month.

There was also bipartisan cooperation against a failed attempt to stop funding the state’s controversial Future Fund, which is an economic development fund controlled by the executive branch, and several failed bills intended to provide property tax relief to South Dakotans.
Sioux Falls Democratic Rep. Erik Muckey said he most clearly saw the shift within the Republican Party in the Future Fund debate, where he said some Republicans reacted to a lack of oversight for the fund by supporting its elimination without “actually digging into” how it works.
“We’re trying to take down an agency, effectively,” Muckey said, “but we don’t actually know what the agency does, the process to get there or what the consequences of a bill is that we didn’t even all probably read, frankly.”
Rep. Chris Kassin, R-Vermillion, said the push for property tax relief included a determination by some freshmen lawmakers to pass property tax cuts without considering costs. That’s primarily because some lawmakers, he said, were quick to “slam something through” and slow to research and understand a bill’s consequences.
The Legislature ultimately passed Rhoden’s legislation including a temporary cap on countywide assessment increases, with plans to dig into the property tax system further with a summer task force.
Other notable efforts that some Republicans and Democrats worked together on failed, such as funding the replacement of the state penitentiary.
The Legislature lost leadership with deep institutional knowledge because of the primary defeats, said Sen. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, leading to less understanding among lawmakers of the process and why bills failed in past sessions.
Davis said some bills saw several layers of amendments, which hinders how lawmakers and the public vet bills in the committee process.
“That’s a drain on the process and the system,” she said.
One of the new legislative leaders, House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, told South Dakota Searchlight by phone that he saw factions of Republicans working with Democrats during the session. He described the comments made during the panel as part of an attempt to frame the session as “fraught and chaotic.”

The bills highlighted by lawmakers during the panel weren’t bad, he said, but were emblematic of the divide within the Republican Party. The Future Fund and property tax discussions, he said, showed the divide is centered on government involvement in economic development and government spending.
“What some people call bad, others call conservative,” Odenbach said.
Odenbach said the next session will be different as freshman lawmakers have a year under their belts and a better understanding of the legislative process. The divide, he said, will remain.

(Photo via U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission)Data centers used for artificial intelligence and other aspects of the online world are likely to have a significant impact on Pennsylvania’s energy economy in coming years, according to the head of the state Public Utility Commission. 
The PUC unanimously approved Chairperson Stephen DeFrank’s motion Thursday to hold a hearing April 24 on how to protect consumers, while harnessing the opportunities for economic growth, technological advancement, electricity market stability and bolstering national security.
“Balancing concerns like these is one of the primary mandates of the commission,” DeFrank said in the motion, adding that it would be required to provide non-discriminatory access to public utilities, while guarding against undue burdens and costs for existing customers and risk to electric utilities.
At least two large data center projects are in the works that have the potential to affect Pennsylvania’s electrical grid.
Constellation Energy announced in September a $1.6 billion investment to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island in Dauphin County. The  deal wouldprovide carbon-free electricity to supply power for software giant Microsoft’s AI data centers in the region.
This month, Amazon Web Services announced the $650 million purchase of a data center with 1,200 acres of land adjacent to the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant near Berwick, Luzerne County. AWS plans to build a data center campus that would consume as much energy as 900,000 homes.
Jon Gordon, wholesale markets manager for Advanced Energy United, an association of clean energy providers, told the Capital-Star the prospect of many large data centers being located in a region introduces new variables into the economy.
“Forecasting energy demand used to be relatively straightforward. Demand grew in a straight line with economic activity,” he said.
The demand from data centers could affect electricity supply and reliability when added to already increased demand from electric vehicles and heating, the retirement of fossil-fuel generating stations, the push to increase the amount of carbon-neutral energy being used, and delays in getting clean energy generation on line, Gordon said.
“We don’t know how speculative these projects are and how many are actually going to come online,” he said. “In the energy industry, we need to figure out which ones are actually going to get built.”
DeFrank noted such projects may require upgrades to electrical distribution systems to connect to the grid. The PUC must ensure that if utilities pay for improvements to serve projects that ultimately do not materialize that current ratepayers are not left with the bill.
“In such cases, questions may arise about who will ultimately bear these stranded costs. Providing certainty may mean requiring deposits or other finance security, minimum contract terms, or some sort of breakage or termination fee for loads that decide not to proceed with construction,” DeFrank’s motion said.
The PUC also needs to provide large electricity users with certainty regarding how long it will take and how much it will cost to connect to the grid. Users willing to pay for and build system upgrades may be able to connect faster. But utilities may take a conservative approach to large projects, DeFrank said.

Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which operates clinics in the St. Louis region, Rolla and Springfield, and Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates clinics in Kansas City and Columbia, received a letter from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Thursday stating their complication plans did not meet state requirements.
The decision means that almost five months after voters approved a constitutional amendment restoring abortion rights, the most common method to terminate a pregnancy is not available in Missouri.

This rejection was based on the criteria of an emergency rule published the same day by the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office. 
That rule requires the complication plan for any facility prescribing abortion medication to more than 10 women a month must: 

Have an on-call OB-GYN who lives within 25 miles of the clinic available at all times for seven days after a patient takes the medication. This physician would be required to treat any complications that arise as a result of the medication unless the standard of care requires someone else to treat them. 
Provide for patients who live further than 25 miles from the clinic, the name of the emergency room and a physician “within a reasonable distance of the location where the patient will complete the abortion.”
Submit the full names of all physicians involved in the local complication plans.

While three clinics —Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis — have resumed some procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood leadership have said they will not begin prescribing medication abortions without an approved complication plan. 
Leadership with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers is still deciding on next steps, a spokesperson said. 
The Department of Health and Senior Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement in February, department spokeswoman Sami Jo Freeman said complication plans are “important to ensure the safety of patients because medication abortions will likely be completed at home without a physician present.” 
When the clinics submitted their complication plans in February, they did not include the names of any physicians involved. The proposals state that patients could contact the clinic at any time with concerns, including an after-hours line staffed by licensed nurses who can refer calls to an on-call physician. 
“If a potentially urgent complication is suspected based on the patient’s symptoms or the patient is not able to return to the health center in a timely way, the nurse will direct them to the emergency department (ED),” the initial plans submitted by Planned Parenthood read. 
With the patient’s consent, the proposal continued, the ER would be told the patient’s medical history if possible. Planned Parenthood would follow up with the patient the next day.
Across the country, abortion medication is the most common method used to end a pregnancy.
In 2023, nearly two-thirds of abortions in the United States took place using medication as opposed to in-clinic procedures, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group.   
In states where abortion is legal, medication that induces a miscarriage is available to patients in their first trimester of pregnancy. Patients typically take two doses of medication, the second of which is often taken at home. In recent years, a growing number of women have been ordering abortion medication from online providers in the United States and abroad, including to states where abortion remains illegal. 
According to the FDA, mifepristone is safe to use if taken as directed. Cramping and bleeding are common side effects of the medication. Those prescribed mifepristone are urged to call their doctor if they experience heavy bleeding, abdominal pain or a fever. The same guidance applies to those who recently underwent procedural abortions, experienced miscarriages or delivered a baby.   
Since the medication was approved for use 28 years ago, only 32 deaths have been reported associated with mifepristone, according to the FDA. 
Earlier this month, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey issued a notice of an intent to serve a cease and desist letter to the Planned Parenthood clinics, doubling down on his demand that Planned Parenthood stop performing a type of abortion that its clinics aren’t actually offering patients.
Several Planned Parenthood clinics remained open even after the procedure was outlawed statewide in June 2022. The clinics primarily provide family planning services, cancer screenings and STI testing and treatment, including to patients on Medicaid. 
Shortly after Missourians in November narrowly approved Amendment 3, granting the constitutional right to an abortion, Planned Parenthood sued the state, arguing dozens of regulations on abortion providers were no longer constitutional. 
In mid-February, a Jackson County judge struck down most of the regulations, allowing Planned Parenthood to resume in-clinic procedural abortions for the first time in years. 
Abortion returns to Columbia, opening access for mid-Missouri for first time since 2018

The first abortion to happen in Missouri since the procedure was outlawed statewide in June 2022 took place in February at a Kansas City clinic. In early March, procedural abortions returned to the clinic in Columbia for the first time since 2018. 
And on Thursday, the clinic in St. Louis quietly performed its first two abortions since 2022. 
The clinic plans to take additional abortion patients who are earlier than 12 weeks gestation over the coming weeks, but the number of days abortion is provided in St. Louis will depend on physicians’ schedules, Nick Dunne, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood, said Friday.
Staff at the St. Louis clinic did not initially indicate they would bring back procedural abortions this soon. 
“Ahead of the December ruling, our staff had been preparing to start providing medication abortion — including staff training, as well as ordering supplies and medications,” Dunne said in a statement. “Recognizing more recently that we were likely to face additional hurdles from state officials on medication abortion, our medical and patient services teams pivoted to allocating staff, equipment, and other necessary resources in order to begin offering procedural abortion again.” 
Planned Parenthood likely won’t be able to begin offering procedural abortions at its clinics in Rolla or Springfield until additional physicians are hired, Dunne said, adding that Planned Parenthood is “working aggressively” to expand their physician numbers.
There are currently two long-term staff physicians and one contracted physician at Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which also oversees the clinic in Fairview Heights. The two long-term physicians are both based in the St. Louis area.

The audits, aimed at evaluating security and safety standard compliance at the Ionia Correctional Facility, Baraga Correctional Facility and Richard A. Handlon Correctional Facility, found some overlapping issues with security that State Auditor General Doug Ringler said in the reports could lead to harm for those who are incarcerated, as well as staff and visitors.
The reports each offer recommendations and possible remedies to the issues presented such as evaluating procedures by the Department of Corrections, or MDOC, on metal detector usage, and improving safety checks for those in the prison.
While the shortcomings outlined in the audits are serious, they are fixable and MDOC has started to address the issues outlined and take proper measures for accountability from the employees who falsified records, MDOC Legislative Liaison Kyle Kaminski told lawmakers on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Corrections and Judiciary Thursday.
“We’re not trying to minimize the findings of those audits. We take them very seriously. We’re going to learn from them.. We agree that those findings are problematic,” Kaminski said. “We had started to institute some changes even before the audit was done… While it covers three facilities, we take it as a lesson that we need to apply to all 26 facilities.”
Lawmakers on the committee expressed sympathy for the national staffing shortage state prisons are facing, noting that lawmakers have been confronted in recent years with the task of creating policies to alleviate some of the strains that sector of the workforce endures.
Corrections officers have incredibly difficult jobs, but these lapses in performing duties to ensure public safety can’t stand, House Appropriations Chair Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) said in a statement Friday.
“These findings are deeply troubling and highlight a dangerous lack of oversight in our corrections system,” Bollin said. “When officers are failing to conduct thorough searches of inmates, vehicles, and staff entering the prison, it creates a major security risk…We must prioritize improving staffing levels while also ensuring that all security measures are enforced consistently.”

About 38% of the prison cell searches correction officers logged at the Ionia Correctional Facility that auditors reviewed between May and June of 2023 were falsified, meaning no officers even entered the cells they said were checked, according to an audit report. And still, officers only documented about 80% of the minimum number of cell or bunk checks, with about one third of actual checks performed lasting less than one minute, calling into question the thoroughness of the checks performed.
Issues with falsifying records of checks, not performing the appropriate number of checks and the reality of those checks being done in a matter of seconds, were cause for concern for audits, especially as they were able to carry contraband through all the metal detectors they tested.
Auditors were able to carry in a pair of 6-inch needle nose pliers, a 7-inch pair of scissors, a 3-inch seam ripper and 4-inch seam ripper, according to an audit report.
At the Richard Handlon Correctional Facility, also in Ionia, auditors were able to get a welding rod, a flat piece of stainless steel and a 5-7 inch-long piece of scrap metal through metal detectors in July of 2023, according to an audit report.
Auditors found that corrections officers at Baraga Correctional Facility in the Upper Peninsula falsified cell search records about 25% of the time and nearly half of the cell searches that were observed were completed in less than a minute in an audit.
The falsification of records is not reflective of the majority of corrections staff, Kaminski told lawmakers Thursday, though the issue is being taken seriously and those scenarios were referred for investigation and potential discipline. 
“That type of falsification certainly will not be tolerated and at the same time, it’s resulted in us changing some of our internal quality assurance processes to say, ‘Okay… we can no longer feel like… just because it’s documented, that it’s sufficient, that it occurred, we’re going to have to go back, look at video, do other things to try to determine exactly what was done and how well it was done,” Kaminski said.

(Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources photo)FRANKFORT — The first Black member of a board overseeing Kentucky’s wildlife management agency apparently lost his seat under a GOP-backed law that a Senate leader said was justified by political Facebook posts.
The Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate did not confirm the reappointment of Jerry Ferrell to the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission when it adjourned Friday. Under previous state law, Ferrell would have been allowed to serve on the commission until the end of the year. But under Senate Bill 245, a new law passed over the veto of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear that only impacts Ferrell this year, he is required to vacate his position with the legislature’s adjournment.
Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, had said SB 245 was spurred in reaction to political Facebook posts purportedly shared by Ferrell that Stivers considered to be inappropriate for a sitting member of a state board. Stivers specifically mentioned a Facebook post purportedly shared by Ferrell that showed a majority of U.S. Supreme Court justices in “KKK hoodies”. 
Ferrell previously told the Lantern he believed SB 245 was targeting him for social media posts he’s shared with his political views, commentary he believed is separate from and not relevant to his work on the Fish and Wildlife Commission. Ferrell was also concerned his removal was a part of a larger “culture” against diversity. 
Stivers had denied Ferrell’s removal had anything to do with race, saying he didn’t know Ferrell’s race when the issue of the Facebook posts was brought to him. Ferrell told the Lantern on Friday he was skeptical that Stivers wasn’t aware he is Black. 
Ferrell, a veteran, said he was angry about the situation, arguing he didn’t believe “people really understand what it means to be Black in this country.” Ferrell said he was considering his options on how to challenge the removal.
“He wants me out of there. He got his wish,” Ferrell said. “My family has been in service all their life, and that’s what caused me to serve and still serve.” 
The commission is made up of nine unpaid members who oversee the KDFWR’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees, and federal grants. State law directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department.
Ferrell’s removal would leave one vacancy on the commission.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)BOX ELDER — A new state law brought a degree of certainty Friday to a situation filled with unknowns for the Douglas School District.
The law, signed by South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, authorizes a $15 million, zero-interest loan to the district from the state’s housing infrastructure fund. The money will help pay for the construction of a third elementary school.
The extra school is needed because the federal government is developing B-21 stealth bombers, and some of them will be stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, which neighbors the school district’s Box Elder campus.
The construction and extra personnel needed to accommodate the new planes are expected to grow the base and the surrounding area by thousands of people. But the school district doesn’t know when the planes will arrive.
“We know they’re coming probably in the next three to four years,” said Superintendent Kevin Case, “but we don’t have an exact timeline.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)

The district needs a building large enough for 640 students, Case said, which will cost an estimated $62 million. The $15 million loan will help pay for that, and the district anticipates contributing $5 million or more of its own money. The rest will hopefully come from federal funds that South Dakota’s congressional delegates are working to obtain, Case said.
Douglas is uniquely financially hindered by the presence of the vast base, which is not subjected to property taxes. The district gets payments from the federal government to compensate for the lost tax revenue, but Case said it’s not enough to fund a major building project.
Rapid City-area lawmakers have worked for years to win state grant funding for the district. Some other lawmakers opposed the idea, saying it would set a bad precedent and encourage other districts to seek state funding for local projects.
The alternative proposal legislators adopted this year will tap into the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The Legislature created it two years ago with state dollars and federal pandemic relief money, to help spark housing development projects across the state.
Half of the $200 million fund was made available as grants, and all of that money has been awarded. The other half was made available as loans, but demand has been low. More than $80 million was still available as recently as December.
Sen. Helene Duhamel, R-Rapid City, sponsored legislation earlier this year that went through several amendments before it finally reached Gov. Rhoden’s desk in the form of a loan from the housing fund. The legislation gives the state Housing Development Authority permission to make the loan, with a repayment period of 20 years.
The district can use the money for any expenses related to the new school’s construction. Under regular program rules, a loan from the fund can only be used for things like roads, sidewalks, or water and sewer lines to support housing developments.
Rhoden signed the bill Friday in the Vandenberg Elementary School gym at Box Elder.
“We’ve talked about this issue for a couple of years now, as legislators well know,” Rhoden said. “And this, I believe, is the right solution to move forward.”

(Lily Alexander)Kylie Pucella, 21, a trans woman and senior at the University of New Mexico, began hormone therapy when she was 18. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, she has worried that the legal protections for her care in New Mexico — often described as a safe haven for LGBTQ+ people — might not last amid presidential executive orders that target transgender rights.
She’s not the only one.
“People are really scared about losing their access to care,” Adrien Lawyer, co-founder and executive director of the Albuquerque-based New Mexico Transgender Resource Center told Source. “But in New Mexico, that’s very unlikely to happen.”
That’s because the state created a legal framework well in advance of federal rollbacks of trans rights. But that hasn’t stopped legal challenges here, nor fully assuaged the fears of people who consider the care lifesaving.
The care
Gender-affirming care typically includes medication and surgical options that help people feel more aligned with the gender they know themselves to be, according to Dr. Molly McClain, a physician who provides gender-affirming care in the state. Medications include ones to suspend puberty, as well as hormone therapy to initiate puberty aligned with someone’s gender, McClain said. People 18 and older also have surgical options.
“The very important thing for everyone to recognize is that the way that someone feels affirmed in their gender is really, really individually dependent,” McClain said. “So not everybody needs to be on medications, not everybody needs to get surgery, and everyone has their own journey that they are embarking on.”
In New Mexico, most medical practices are doing their best to continue providing gender-affirming care while paying attention to the federal changes, McClain noted.
“I think we have a lot of protections here and a lot of support that kids in other states don’t — a lot of people who see them and hear them and love them,” McClain said.
The legal landscape
In 2023, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Act into law, which in part prohibits public bodies from restricting or discriminating against a person’s right to access gender-affirming care. The act defines gender-affirming care broadly, according to Jazmyn Taitingfong, a reproductive rights and gender equity attorney with ACLU of New Mexico.
“It’s described as psychological, behavioral, surgical, pharmaceutical and medical care services and supplies to support a person’s gender identity,” Taitingfong said. “So that’s a very wide definition, and that’s on purpose so that it protects people from discrimination from public bodies.”
The same year, Lujan Grisham signed protections for reproductive and gender-affirming health care providers and patients into law, preventing public bodies from releasing information or using their resources to assist outside investigations that seek to impose civil or criminal liability on medical providers who provide this care in New Mexico.
“The reason that is so important is that many people are being forced to flee their home state to get certain types of health care — mainly gender affirming care and abortion health care,” Taitingfong said. “And so that is a level of protection if people go back to their home state.”
After taking office in January, Trump signed an order halting the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care for youth under 19 years old. While a federal court blocked the other, NPR reports some hospitals across the country have stopped performing gender-affirming surgeries and providing other care nonetheless.
According to Trans Legislation Tracker, eight anti-trans bills were introduced in the most recent legislative session, one of which would have largely prohibited health care providers from providing gender-affirming care to minors, and opened up doctors to liability. The New Mexico Attorney General’s Office commented that many of the provisions of that bill may have been unconstitutional.
Ultimately, none of the bills made it through the legislative session.
New Mexico’s protections have been long in coming, Lawyer said, noting that LGBTQ+ advocates have worked for decades to create statewide protections.
“We’ve had activists here for a long, long time — 30 years — trying to proactively create a legislative climate at the state level that’s incredibly protective, and it’s worked,” Lawyer said.
Fear persists
Despite the legal protections New Mexico offers, McClain said she worries about the impact of the federal climate on her trans patients and their families.
“What I’m seeing for all of these families is just a much higher level of stress and of fear,” McClain said. “I think we’re going to see a huge uptick in all the things that make trans and nonbinary kids sick already.”
Heather Johnson, also a trans senior at UNM, said she is concerned about the future of insurance coverage for hormone therapy. Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released a proposed rule that would prohibit individual and small business health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act from covering gender-affirming care as an essential health benefit, according to KFF.
“As soon as insurance denies it, it’ll at least triple in price,” Johnson said. “A lot of this stuff is rather expensive, and insurance takes care of a fair amount of it. And so the real fear is that we’ll just be priced out of the medication we need to live.”
Johnson said the care allowed her to live a life that feels normal.
“It’s legitimately a life-saving care,” she said. “Without it, I wouldn’t be here, I guarantee that.”
For Pucella, access to hormone therapy allowed her to become a full version of herself. While she feels relatively safe in New Mexico, she worries that could change as national anti-trans sentiment and federal action continues. 
“I’m not really sure if — given the climate of things if they keep on going the way they’re going — there really is going to be a safe haven anywhere in the U.S. for trans people,” Pucella said.

House Bill 460 is a 2026 budget enhancement for the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. 
Vocational Rehabilitation is a state/federal program that seeks to help people with disabilities secure and retain employment, according to the division’s website. At the time that the division’s financial troubles came to light last year, Vocational Rehabilitation was serving about 8,000 Idahoans with disabilities. 
A year ago, at the very end of the 2024 legislative session, the former administrator of Vocational Rehabilitation suddenly told the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee that the division was out of money and would be unable to pay its bills, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, is a powerful legislative committee that sets the budgets for every state agency and department every year.
  Federal government notified the state of Idaho that grant was considered high risk 

Since the financial problems came to light publicly, the federal Rehabilitation Services Administration (which is part of the U.S. Department of Education) notified the state that the Vocational Rehabilitation grant was considered high risk because of significant concerns about the division’s financial accountability, the Sun previously reported.
In September, the Sun reported Vocational Rehabilitation was offered $10 million in emergency federal funding to help the division pay for people the division has already committed to helping. In order to fully access the federal funds, Idaho would need to provide $2.7 million in state funds.

The supplemental funding includes $2.7 million as a state match to allow Vocational Rehabilitation to access $10 million in emergency federal funds intended to help the agency stay afloat and $1.7 million for client services that have already been provided but are not eligible for federal reimbursement.
Idaho’s state government runs on a fiscal year calendar. The current 2025 fiscal year ends June 30, and the 2026 fiscal year begins July 1.
Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as co-chair of JFAC, acknowledged the division’s financial concerns Friday and said Vocational Rehabilitation is under new leadership.  
“I must give praise to the interim director, who stepped into a difficult situation and is trying to make sense of what’s going on, but it’s a very complicated situation,” Horman said. 
Without any debate, the Idaho House voted 49-20 to pass the Vocational Rehabilitation budget bill.
House Bill 460 heads next to the Idaho Senate for consideration.

On Friday, the Protect Utah Workers coalition, which consists of 14 labor unions, announced it has collected about 130,000 signatures from voters around the state, nearing the threshold to qualify for a ballot referendum. 
“But that is not enough. Not even close,” said Jessica Bruner, director of the Utah Public Employees Association. “We still have a lot of hard work to do to meet the legislature’s complex requirements and guidelines. That means we need to keep up this momentum for two more weeks and gather as many signatures as we can before mid April.”
Bruner spoke from the steps of the Utah Capitol on Friday, alongside a coalition of teachers, electricians, firefighters, city and county workers, and police officers, all of whom have HB267 in their crosshairs.  
Sponsored by Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate terms of employment. 
That means a teachers union, for example, can no longer negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees.

The bill passed both the House and Senate, despite public outcry and bipartisan opposition. On Feb. 14, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed it, though he told reporters he wasn’t happy with the finished product, wishing lawmakers and unions had been able to reach a compromise. 
“Talk about unpopular bills, that was certainly one of them. I think we had 10,000 emails on that one,” Cox said during his monthly PBS news conference last week. 
The sponsors say the bill is meant to protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members — but it was met with staunch criticism from labor advocates.
Now, those same opponents are trying to gather enough signatures to trigger a referendum, where voters could decide whether to overturn the bill on the November 2026 ballot.

That’s a monumental challenge. Of the 26 states that allow ballot referendums, Utah’s process is one of the most restrictive, requiring signatures from at least 8% of the state’s voters in 30 days. In addition, the law requires signatures from 8% of voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
The lieutenant governor’s office will then verify the signatures and, assuming the coalition has complied with state code, ballot language will be crafted for the next general election, where the fate of HB267 is up to voters. 
“I love the referendum process. I love that we have it. I think it’s really important. I think it’s one of those checks on the legislative process,” Cox said during the news conference. “When it does happen, it sends a really important message.” 
The governor said at the time he thinks the coalition “has a chance” to meet the signature threshold. 
The 8% statewide threshold means advocates need slightly more than 140,000 signatures — at nearly 130,000 so far, the coalition is getting close. But there will inevitably be errors, so the coalition is shooting to go well beyond the minimum requirement. 
“We need to double that number before our deadline on April 15,” said Bruner. “We know that we have well-meaning people signing this petition who may not be registered to vote, or put down an incorrect address. They might fill out the form incorrectly, or their signature or handwriting may be illegible. … Although we have nearly 130,000 signatures and overwhelming support, we must keep this momentum going.”

The coalition received an assist this week, with the state’s largest police and firefighter unions throwing their support behind the referendum effort. 
“House bill 267 has stripped the voice of our heroes to advocate for their needs,” said Kevin Murray, president of the Utah Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 5,200 law enforcement officers across the state. “Without a voice, we are unable to advocate for safe working conditions or competitive wages and benefits to attract qualified candidates to protect our communities.”
“We tried to not let it get to this point, but this is where we’re at,” said Jack Tidrow, president of the Professional Firefighters Association of Utah. “We need the public’s help to get us across the finish line.”

Volunteers around Utah who have helped gather signatures say they see little to no opposition, with people from all walks of life signing the packets. 
“Everyone is signing. I’ve had maybe two people say no to me,” said Greg Burrow, interim executive director of the Utah School Employees Association. “Politics is not a part of this at all. People are upset with the Legislature. I don’t think it’s just this issue, I think they believe the Legislature has overstepped on multiple issues and this is a way to make sure their voices are heard.” 
Meanwhile, the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity kicked off its “Decline to Sign” campaign last week. The group, which spoke in support of HB267, says the labor coalition has been spreading misinformation related to HB267 and is urging Utahns not to throw their signatures behind the effort. 
“The messaging that they need these collective bargaining rights when so many are already not using it, is just fundamentally wrong,” said Americans for Prosperity-Utah state director Kevin Greene last week, pointing to other school districts, fire and police departments, and municipalities that don’t collectively bargain and haven’t seen stagnant wages or unsafe work environments.

(Photo by Shelby Kleinhans for Source NM)State lawmakers sent Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham a bill that would, if enacted, allow immigrants authorized to work by the federal government to become police officers in New Mexico.
Currently, New Mexico law limits policing jobs to people with U.S. citizenship.
Senate Bill 364 would open these jobs up to applicants who have work authorization from the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, part of the federal Department of Homeland Security.
According to a spokesperson for the governor, she has not yet decided whether to sign SB364.
“The governor is going through each bill that made it to the 4th floor and there is a process where she evaluates each one. She has until April 11 to decide,” Deputy Director of Communications Jodi McGinnis Porter told Source NM on Friday.
SB364 co-sponsor Sen. Cindy Nava (D-Bernalillo) told the Senate Judiciary Committee the bill would remove “outdated restrictions” in state law and allow immigrants with federal work authorization to be police officers and sheriff’s deputies.
The bill, if enacted, would allow legal permanent residents and beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to become police officers, if they meet all the standards and qualifications, Nava said. She told the House Judiciary Committee it would open the door to more than 51,000 New Mexicans to apply for police jobs.
“These are individuals who are desperately needed by our police departments and sheriff’s offices,” said Nava, who is a DACA recipient herself.
The Albuquerque Police Department has indicated that its 885 sworn officers are 74% of the budgeted capacity, according to the Department of Workforce Solutions’ analysis of the bill. 
Using national survey data from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the department estimates New Mexico has between 749 and 1,947 empty but funded positions for patrol officers, supervisors and detectives.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
SB364 was sponsored by Nava, House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque), Senate Majority Whip Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque), Senate Judiciary Chair Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces), and Sen. Craig Brandt (R-Rio Rancho).
SB364 passed the Senate on March 13 and the House of Representatives on March 21. It passed unanimously through the Senate Tax, Business and Transportation Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, and passed with bipartisan support through the House Judiciary Committee.
Jessica Inez Martinez, director of policy and coalition building at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, was an expert witness on SB364 and told the House Judiciary Committee that legal permanent residents must go through a lengthy process to achieve that status and then in order to maintain it, must not commit specific crimes. DACA recipients, to maintain their status, can’t commit any crimes, she said.
“They would go through the process to do the background checks like every other candidate that is going through the law enforcement process,” she said.
She also noted people who achieve legal permanent residence can also become citizens within three to five years. DACA recipients cannot achieve citizenship but can get work authorization, she said.
Rep. Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque) said she had thought that noncitizens can’t carry firearms and asked how that would work under the bill. Sen. Brandt responded by reading from a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice that outlines exceptions to that prohibition, including DACA recipients who are certified police officers, who may possess firearms and ammunition issued to them by the police department for official use.
If an officer’s job requires them to be armed 24/7, then they are allowed to take the gun home, but if their job only allows them to carry while on shift, then they lock the gun up in the department’s armory every day, Brandt said.
In her presentations to legislative committees about the bill, Nava spoke in detail about her brother, who is a DACA recipient like her and moved away from New Mexico to work for the police department in Blue Island, Illinois.
Jeffrey Farr, chief of police in Blue Island, told the House Judiciary Committee via Zoom that his department employs seven DACA recipients and started hiring them about two years ago because they found it “increasingly difficult to communicate with the community that we are supposed to serve.”
“Each of them have played a vital role in the success of our police department,” Farr said. “I highly encourage you to pass this law.”

That makes six vetoes this year, adding to the two rejections Cox issued this week, turning down a bill that allowed him to appoint the chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court, and another legislative proposal that would have permitted the state to reroute property tax revenue for schools for other purposes.
It’s a different, stronger approach than last year’s when Cox issued vetoes on seven bills he said could have been “a phone call” since they were unnecessary.

However, some things remained the same as last year — like the governor’s usual plea to see fewer bills during the 45-day session. The Legislature passed 582 bills in 2025, not a record-breaking number, but still more than what passed in previous years.
“To further illustrate the nature of the concern, there have been 646 education bills passed in the last five years, representing ~23% of all bills passed,” Cox wrote in his veto letter. “While many of these bills greatly benefit our students, parents, and educators, this additional regulation creates a significant burden upon local education agencies and their genuine efforts to be in compliance with the new statutory expectations within short timeframes.”
Cox vetoes bill that would have given governor power over appointing Utah chief justice

The increase also represents an additional burden for the public, state entities and local governments, Cox said. Something he, again, hopes to avoid next year.
As the list of vetoes is still fresh, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said lawmakers will discuss how to best proceed during the next couple of weeks.
“Utah stands out as the top state in the nation because of our ability to come together and chart the best course for our future. While there may be differences of opinion and we do not always agree, I appreciate the governor’s commitment to working collaboratively to build an even brighter future for our great state,” Adams said in a statement.
In addition to the full vetoes, Cox rejected certain line items from appropriation bills, excluding money directed to legislative proposals that didn’t pass. Those provisions would be addressed in a special session, he said.
Here’s what Cox vetoed on Thursday night:
SB197, Property Tax Amendments
Sponsored by Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, the bill was a proposal to phase out the Circuit Breaker program, a property tax relief program for low-income senior and indigent residents in Utah. Under the legislation, McCay said, people who have assets but are unable to pay their share of taxes on them could defer their property taxes until a later date, whenever they sell their homes.
“The property tax circuit breaker program is growing significantly and that amount of money has been difficult to try to plan for and balance,” McCay told the Senate in February. 
The bill passed the House and Senate with a fair amount of opposition from lawmakers of both parties. A group of senior citizen, housing and low-income advocates and the Utah County tax administrator spoke against the bill and asked for a veto.
Cox said in his veto letter that a number of county government leaders had concerns about the administrative challenges the policy would entail. They also worried about what this would mean for seniors in the state.
“While S.B. 197 contains well-intentioned goals of reforming and streamlining property tax relief programs, it risks cutting off the most vulnerable of Utah’s expanding senior population from a critical tax relief lifeline, while also adding administrative burdens on counties,” Cox wrote. “A more prudent approach would be to revisit these reforms as part of a comprehensive, coordinated review of Utah’s tax system.”
HB306, Precious Metals Amendments
Sponsored by Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan, the legislation would have made Utah the first state in the country to allow vendors to receive payment in gold or silver from the state. The bill also directed the state treasurer to start a competitive bid process for a company to create a payment system, integrated in the state’s accounting structure, to facilitate electronic payments backed by precious metals. 
Utah 1st in the nation to pass these 5 bills: Flags, fluoride, gold and more

The proposal followed HB348, a 2024 bill that allowed the treasurer to invest up to 10% of Utah’s rainy day funds in precious metals and created the Utah Precious Metals Study Workgroup.
“While Utah has been implementing last year’s H.B. 348, Precious Metals Amendments, under which the state treasurer may invest in precious metals, there are significant problems that make H.B. 306 operationally impracticable,” Cox wrote. “Additionally, I am concerned that a specific entity offered to fund the bill, which could jeopardize the required competitive process in the bill.”
Treasurer Marlo Oaks had supported the bill, arguing it would open up another choice for financial transactions in the state.
“H.B. 306 gives state vendors the option to be paid in precious metals, while ensuring the physical assets backing the system are stored in Utah and subject to regular audits,” Oaks said in a news release. “This not only supports a secure and transparent system, but also takes an important step toward making transactional gold a viable option for all citizens.”
According to the release from the treasurer’s office, Kevin Freeman, founder of Economic War Room, and who also served on the Utah Precious Metals Workgroup, wrote a roadmap for states to implement transactional gold and silver systems.
“This isn’t just about gold,” Freeman said about the bill. “It’s about liberty, privacy, and economic justice. I’m proud to see constitutional currency come to life in this historic legislation.”
HB315, Elected Official Vacancy Modifications
Sponsored by Rep. Andrew Stoddard, D-Sandy, the bill would have allowed breaking a tie among three or more candidates in elections for midterm vacancies in municipal offices through a “game of chance.” 



Let us know what you think...


 


According to the bill, the local council would be able to hold a game in which “the outcome is determined by chance” and “each participant has equal odds of winning.” 
But, that language may be problematic for a state like Utah, which includes in its constitution a lottery prohibition. 
“In light of the language of the Utah Constitution that the ‘Legislature shall not authorize any game of chance,’ I am vetoing the bill out of an abundance of caution to avoid creating potential legal issues for the state in this area,” Cox wrote in the letter.
SB106, Utah-Ireland Trade Commission 
Sponsored by Sen. Wayne Harper, R-Taylorsville, the proposal appropriated $10,000 to create a trade commission between Utah and Ireland composed of six legislators and five appointees from the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity.
The bill initially failed in the House during the session’s last week, with many lawmakers questioning the need for such an entity. But it was brought back the same night, passing comfortably. 
“While I understand the intent of this bill, I continue to be wary of creating new commissions in statute. Thanks to your outstanding work, we are now under 400 boards and commissions in the state,” Cox said. “Let’s not go backward on this when it is not necessary to do so!”
Cox also expressed concerns about creating a trade commission for a specific country when others, which are more significant trade partners for the state, don’t receive the same treatment. 
“We don’t need to create a new commission when I can do everything that this bill calls for without a new statute or a new trade commission,” Cox said. “I do these things on behalf of the state of Utah regularly.”

[&#8230;],"A view of the Ten Lakes Wilderness Study Area in northwest Montana. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)A Senate joint resolution urging Congress to release over a million acres of wilderness study area in Montana from consideration of inclusion into the National Wilderness Preservation System brought significant opposition this week.
Montana lawmakers can only urge federal action on these parcels of land since only Congress has the authority to classify the land.
The National Wilderness Preservation System protects about 111 million acres of land across the country. No action has been taken yet on the measure, Senate Resolution 14, which was brought by Sen. Tony Tezak, R-Ennis.
Proponents of the resolution said it would open up the areas to more uses, like ranching and logging. Opponents argued the resolution was a full-fledged assault on public lands. 
The resolution would involve a little more than a million acres.
The Wilderness Study Area Act was passed in 1977, and none of the land under consideration has been formally designated as wilderness. 
Tezak believes the land should be, “returned into public lands management decisions of our local forest service and Bureau of Land Management districts, rather than their current state of being managed as a wilderness study area dictated by Washington, D.C.
The 1977 law requires a review of potential wilderness areas within five years. The resolution addresses this specifically, as well as a 2000 law that created more study areas on Bureau of Land Management land.
“The vast majority of Montana lands identified in the Montana Wilderness Study Act have never been formally recommended by the Secretary of Agriculture for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System and no law has been signed by the President to designate these lands as wilderness,” the bill reads.
Opponents of the bill included Wild Montana, Montana Chapter of Back Country Hunters and Anglers, Trout Unlimited, and many individual residents. The Blackfeet Tribe, Fort Belknap Indian Community and the Chippewa Cree Tribe of Rocky Boy also opposed the resolution.
“We see this as a destructive attempt to undermine the hard work the localized community, including the Blackfeet Tribe, has done to protect these areas,” said Patrick Yawakie, who was representing multiple tribal communities.
Proponents for the bill included the Montana Stock Growers Association as well as several ranchers. 
“We are supporters of multiple use of public lands, and know that management of WSAs can curtail livestock grazing, something our organization cares deeply about,” said Ellie Brighton, who was representing the Montana Stock Growers Association. “Many existing WSAs did not have substantial support from livestock producers, and we support a collaborative approach.”
Opponents of the bill pointed to the slow pace of the federal government for not resolving the issue.
“The problem with creating lasting solutions for WSAs is not with the locally developed collaboratives or the balanced proposals that they’ve developed,” said Noah Marion, representing Wild Montana. “The problem is with Washington, D.C., and their inability to pass legislation in a timely manner. There have been many bills in DC to resolve the status of WSAs, including one in the late ‘80s that resolved many of them. That was pocket vetoed.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20211002_1646142-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-03-28 19:04:48.322770

Phil Murphy's energy agenda while Democrats pointed the finger at the state's grid operator.","With energy prices rising, Republican officials blamed Gov. Phil Murphy's energy agenda while Democrats pointed the finger at the state's grid operator. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers’ first hearing on soaring electricity prices oscillated between criticism of Gov. Phil Murphy’s energy agenda, condemnation of the state’s grid operator, and desperate calls for New Jersey to avoid shrinking its existing generation supply.
Throughout Friday’s nearly six-hour hearing of a joint committee that included members of the state Senate and Assembly, Republican members pressed officials on the impact of Murphy’s push to shift New Jersey’s electricity generation to renewable sources, arguing it is to blame for spiking electricity costs.
“I can’t help but get the impression today that we’re here because all of a sudden the rates went up and people are like, ‘Wow’ — you know, like it wasn’t foreseen or that it couldn’t have been predicted,” said Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris). “Many of my colleagues have been sounding the alarm on the governor’s misplaced energy master plan and the costs associated with it for five years.”
Witnesses and Democratic legislators put the blame elsewhere, citing market rules for the state’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, that excluded some power plants from the supply sold in recent price-setting electricity auctions and other reforms that slowed the organization’s review of pending generation projects.
Utility customers will see their monthly electricity bills rise by roughly $25 beginning in June as a result of a February generation auction, which followed surging prices at a separate capacity auction held in October.
Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly have been particularly anxious about the planned increases, since all 80 seats in the body are up for grabs in this year’s elections (Democrats in that body hold a 52-28 majority).
“It’s not a secret that we at the BPU and in New Jersey and other states have felt that PJM has made decisions that lean toward fossil fuel generation and the states that have large-scale fossil fuel generation,” Christine Guhl-Sadovy, president of the Board of Public Utilities, told the committee.

Demand for power in New Jersey grew slowly for decades before surging in recent years as load forecasts — which predict how much power New Jersey and 12 other states on PJM’s grid will need in future years — began to account for artificial intelligence data centers proposed throughout PJM’s service area.
These data centers are incredibly power-hungry, though Asim Haque, a senior vice president at PJM, warned that officials are still trying to determine the overall scale of that demand. It isn’t always clear, he said, which data center proposals are authentic.
“The industry is legitimately struggling with what is real on these data centers. It is not an easy issue to unpack,” he said.
PJM operates the electric grid for a region that stretches from New Jersey down to North Carolina and from parts of Illinois over to Washington, D.C. It coordinates the movement of electricity from gas, coal, wind, and other generators and distributes it to the utilities serving the roughly 70 million people who live in its service area.
Beginning in 2019, Haque said, PJM’s interconnection queue — the list of new generators seeking to connect to its grid — saw changes. Where past projects were typically large, newer projects were smaller and more renewable, and their sheer number increased the interconnector’s backlog.
PJM is expected to finish transforming its interconnection queue early next year and anticipates wait times for projects will then fall to between one and two years. But it could still take years for new generation to come online even after the interconnector gives the green light.
Lawmakers of both parties — and Republicans in particular — have urged for a reversal of state policies that seek to increase generation from renewable sources and phase out fossil ones. But some witnesses said Friday that generation from some renewable sources like solar and battery storage would come online fastest.
Once they received interconnection approval, some battery projects have come online in less than two years, said Abe Silverman, assistant research scholar at John Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute.
A new gas plant would likely take between five and seven years to stand up, and because even small amounts of new generation can relieve demand pressures on electricity, additions of a few hundred or thousand megawatts can significantly reduce electricity costs for consumers.
“Even small amounts of new megawatts can really have an outsized impact on prices, and we should be scouring the couch cushions for anything we can deploy in the next 18 to 24 months,” Silverman said.
Natural gas should still play a role in New Jersey’s energy mix, witnesses said. Natural gas accounted for 49% of electricity generated in New Jersey in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while the state’s two nuclear plants accounted for 42% and renewables made up roughly 8%.
Interest in gas projects from investors and consumers — including data centers that are a major driver of increasing energy needs — has waned in recent years, Silverman said, and projects on PJM’s waitlist are increasingly renewable.
New Jersey Rate Counsel Brian Lipman added some proposed changes — like pending legislation that would require utilities to join a regional transmission organization like PJM to deny them additional profit for voluntarily joining one — could reduce how much New Jerseyans pay for electricity.
Greater oversight of organizations receiving ratepayer money, whether through subsidies funded on utility bills or groups like PJM, could also help control costs, he said.
“One the things I would strongly recommend is we require those taking ratepayer money to open up their books. Let the BPU and rate counsel see their books,” Lipman told the panel. “In fairness to utilities, they don’t get to spend a penny that I can’t look at and see what they spent it on, where they spent it.”
The impact of surging electricity prices could be keenly felt, Lipman said, especially as the seasons shift into sweltering summers or frigid winters.
“I am not being sensationalist when I say people will die,” Lipman said in written remarks prepared for the committee. “Heat-related deaths will increase as we make air conditioning more unaffordable. Likewise, we just completed a brutally cold winter. If heating becomes unaffordable, people will freeze.”

The high-profile killing late last year of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has focused even more attention on so-called prior authorization, the process by which patients and doctors must ask health insurers to approve medical procedures or drugs before proceeding. There had been protests and outrage over the company’s practices for months before Thompson’s death, and UnitedHealthcare has been accused in a class-action lawsuit of using AI to wrongfully deny claims.
As more patients and doctors voice their frustrations, states are responding with legislation designed to regulate prior authorization and claims reviews. So far this year, lawmakers in more than a dozen states are considering measures that would, for example, limit the use of AI in reviewing claims; exclude certain prescription medications from prior authorization rules; ensure that emergency mental health care is not delayed for more than 48 hours; and require that insurers’ review boards include licensed physicians, dentists or pharmacists with clinical experience.
Insurers have long required doctors to obtain their approval before they’ll pay for certain drugs, treatments and procedures. They argue it is necessary to rein in health care costs and limit unnecessary services. But many doctors and patients say the practice has gotten out of hand, causing delays and denials of care that are harming and even killing people.
In a survey last year by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors said that insurers’ prior authorization practices delayed “necessary care” for their patients. Twenty-nine percent said such delays had led to a “serious adverse event,” such as hospitalization, permanent injury or death.
In 2023, insurers selling plans on the marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act denied a combined average of 20% of all claims. Of the 73 million in-network claims they denied, only 1% were appealed, according to KFF, a health policy research group.
 The federal role

Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice took a firmer hand against health care corporations alleged to be engaging in behavior resulting in limited and more expensive care for patients. The administration also approved rules requiring that beginning in 2026, Medicare and Medicaid plans create a streamlined electronic process for reviewing claims, making decisions more quickly and providing specific reasons for denying care.
But it’s difficult to hold insurers accountable, according to Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.
“Each part of the health care industry — hospitals, pharmaceuticals, insurers — they all have a lot of concentrated power,” McBride said in a phone interview. “And unless somebody actually takes it on directly, it’s going to stay that way. I think the Biden administration tried to take it on, but didn’t make a lot of progress.”
It’s unclear whether the Trump administration and Congress will reverse course. During his confirmation hearing on March 14, Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, defended the use of artificial intelligence in reviewing claims.
“AI can be used for good or for evil, and it to a large extent depends on who’s using it and for what purpose,” Oz told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. “I think AI could play a vital role in accelerating preauthorization.”
In the past, Trump has supported measures to help patients, such as increasing hospital price transparency and lowering prescription drug prices, McBride noted. But “Republicans and conservatives generally are anti-regulation,” he said. “My gut feeling would be that they back off on the Biden push on this.”
States have limited power to act on their own. They have authority only over state-regulated health plans, which include Medicaid, plans for state workers and policies residents purchase from the ACA marketplaces. About 90 million people are covered that way. State laws do not apply to the 156 million workers, retirees and dependents who get their coverage through employer-sponsored health plans, which are regulated through a federal law known as ERISA.
Furthermore, health insurance companies are large and have deep pockets, allowing them to easily absorb state fines.
But Kaye Pestaina, the director of the program on patient and consumer protection at KFF, said states have an important role to play.
“Much of the focus around prior authorization at the federal level has kind of originated from state protections, so I imagine there will be continual activity by state legislatures to come at the problem,” Pestaina told Stateline.
 What states are doing

Pestaina said states are trying a number of solutions. For example, states such as Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have given their insurance regulators more authority to directly access claims denial information, in order to overturn decisions or potentially enforce state rules. And these efforts have largely had bipartisan support.
In Pennsylvania, Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill pushed through bipartisan legislation in 2022 to streamline prior authorization practices for state-regulated health plans after hearing numerous complaints from patients and doctors.
The legislation created an Independent External Review organization that allows Pennsylvanians to submit an online form to request a review if their insurer denies a service or treatment. If the review organization decides the service should be covered, the insurer must do so. Before then, patients could turn only to a federal review process, which may have been more challenging to navigate and taken more time.
“Our reforms created clear rules, clear timelines for the prior authorization process, and it removed ambiguity or uncertainty from the system that at times, insurers could exploit and providers could be confused over,” Phillips-Hill told Stateline. “Prior to that reform, if you had a denial from your insurer, you had very little recourse.”
The program began in January 2024, and in its first year the Pennsylvania Insurance Department overturned half of 517 denials, which amounted to claims from 259 people.
Jonathan Greer, president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said his trade group worked with lawmakers to come to an agreement on how to change the prior authorization process in a way that worked for insurers and patient advocates. Greer says he thinks Pennsylvania could be a model for other states.
“Prior authorization, I think unfairly, has been characterized as a reason to say ‘no’ by insurers,” Greer said. “The purpose of prior authorization is to make sure that you know the care that you get is consistent with the care that you need.”
In North Carolina, Republican state Rep. Timothy Reeder is hopeful that his prior authorization bill will make it across the finish line this year. Reeder’s bill would set tight deadlines on insurers’ claim decisions and require companies to have licensed practitioners on their claim review boards. Insurers would also have to publicize a list of services they require authorization for.
“I’m not saying that we need to get rid of it completely,” Reeder told Stateline. “There is a role for some oversight to make sure that things are covered. But right now, I think the system is out of balance.”
But some state laws have proven to be less effective than advertised.
In 2021, Texas enacted a first-of-its-kind law creating a “gold card” standard, under which physicians whose care recommendations are approved by insurers at least 90% of the time are exempt from the prior authorization process. But as of the end of 2023, only 3% of Texas physicians had earned gold card status, according to the Texas Medical Association.
That’s why the group is pushing legislation that would require insurers to report which preauthorization exemptions they granted and denied and how many claims went to independent review. Dr. Zeke Silva of the Texas Medical Association’s legislative council said it would be “in the same spirit” as what Pennsylvania has done.
“Our focus with the [Texas Medical Association] is our physicians being able to provide the best care possible. And we want that to be free of burden,” Silva told Stateline. “We want to minimize third parties coming in and inappropriately denying care that our physicians and our patients think is in their best interest.”

Instead, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission attempted to strike a balance, approving some of the company’s proposed changes to customers’ gas and electric bills, while significantly slashing its capital spending plan under a series of motions approved Friday afternoon.
The various changes to bills for both gas and electric customers take effect April 1.
Soaring utility bills brought a standing room-only crowd of residents, advocates and lawmakers to the commission’s Warwick offices earlier this month, with many urging the commission to reject rate increases and to offer more relief to vulnerable residents. But the regulatory panel is powerless to influence at least some of the components of customers’ bills, including the supply rate. State law prevents regulators from denying seasonal usage rates as long as they reflect the prices Rhode Island Energy pays to third-party suppliers.
Seasonal fluctuations in electric prices, dictated by regional demand and global conflict, have been particularly volatile in the last few years, peaking in the winter of 2022. But summer savings are again in store, with the price per kilowatt-hour set to drop nearly 39% over current winter rates. For the average residential customer using 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, this translates to a $31 monthly savings on supply-side charges.
However, lower supply charges will be partially offset by higher customer fees relating to transmission fees, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, which are set based on federal and state laws. And, customers will pay more to support the company’s capital investments in the electric and gas infrastructure — though far less than what Rhode Island Energy wanted.
State regulators spent nearly all of the three-and-a-half hour hearing Friday picking apart the company’s fiscal 2026 gas and electric capital budgets, which pay for maintenance and repairs meant to ensure reliability and safety.
Chairman Ronald Gerwatowski criticized PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, for substantially increasing yearly capital spending, far above the annual hikes proposed under former utility operator National Grid.
Indeed, the company’s proposed electric fiscal 2026 capital budget which starts April 1 is more than double what National Grid spent in fiscal 2022, the last year before the utility business was sold. And Rhode Island Energy’s proposed fiscal 2026 gas capital investments are $16 million more than what was spent under National Grid in fiscal 2022.
PPL in a call with its investors earlier this year said it hopes to invest more than $1.3 billion into Rhode Island’s electric grid over the next four years, and nearly as much on the natural gas side.
“While it is positive that PPL and RI Energy wish to invest in Rhode Island, there are significant rate implications in the future tied to these ambitious investment goals,” Gerwatowski said.

Flattening the pancake tower
He likened the various charges built into customers’ bills as individual pancakes, which must be considered not only on their own, but as a plate.
“It is the cumulative effect of the entire pancake tower that strains affordability,” he said. “Unfortunately, many of the pancake costs, we have no control over. But the company does have control over the pace of its investments.”
The proposed $247.9 million in electric investments includes $88 million in fiscal 2026 spending on “smart meters,” which was approved separately in 2023.The remaining $160 million would pay for repairs to electric poles and wires, substations, and tree-trimming, among other costs.
Commissioners shaved $29 million off the proposed electric budget, including $24 million from general “soft costs” associated with electric grid repairs, and $5 million from the budget for major projects. The final $131 million electric fiscal 2026 budget marks an 18% cut to what Rhode Island Energy proposed, excluding the fixed smart meter costs.
The proposed $223 million in fiscal 2026 gas capital spending rankled commissioners more.
“I almost fell out of my chair when I saw that number,” Gerwatowski said of the gas spending plan, noting that it was more than the $221 million in federal grants helping pay for the Washington Bridge rebuild.
Commissioner Abigail Anthony said the company’s witnesses failed to provide “compelling evidence” that the spending hikes were necessary, rather than discretionary. Especially as the state contemplates shifting away from reliance on natural gas to meet its decarbonization mandates.
The final $179.5 million gas capital budget authorized by commissioners marks a nearly 20% cut over what Rhode Island Energy proposed, with cuts scaling back the scope of gas main replacement to only those lines in immediate need of an upgrade.
The original fiscal 2026 electric capital spending plan would have translated to $1.01 average monthly increase for electric customers, while the $223 million gas capital budget was set to bring a $78.58 average annual increase for gas customers. Bill charges under the reduced spending plans approved by utility regulators Friday have not yet been calculated.
Greg Cornett, president of Rhode Island Energy, expressed disappointment in the cuts to capital budgets in an emailed response Friday.
“Our focus remains on delivering safe, reliable service and maintaining the strength of our energy infrastructure,” Cornett said. “While we are disappointed that the public utility commission has reduced our requested investments, which we developed in consultation with the Division of Public Utilities & Carriers, we will continue to remain focused on safety and reliability to meet the needs of our customers. Ongoing investment is essential as the energy landscape evolves, and we remain committed to working within the approved framework to maintain our infrastructure for the future.”
Customers in seven municipalities — Barrington, Central Falls, Narragansett, Newport, Portsmouth, Providence, and South Kingstown — can opt out of Rhode Island Energy electric prices and participate instead in a community aggregation plan that leverages bulk buying power to secure lower-priced electricity for residents. The default community summer electric rate of 10.014 cents per kilowatt-hour is 0.5% less than Rhode Island Energy’s base residential electricity supply rate. Community aggregation electric rates take effect May 1.
About 25% of the 780,000 Rhode Island Energy customers already opt out of the company’s default electric prices.

(File photos) The Republican judge who is seeking to throw out more than 60,000 votes in order to win a seat on the state Supreme Court dressed in a Confederate uniform while a member of a UNC-Chapel Hill fraternity, the Associated Press reported. 
Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin was a member of Kappa Alpha, a fraternity that claims Confederate General Robert E. Lee as its spiritual founder, the AP reported. The wire service obtained a photograph of Griffin posing with other fraternity members at its “Old South” ball in 2001 and a 2000 photograph of Griffin and other fraternity members in front of a Confederate flag. 
While Griffin told the AP that his attendance at the ball is not a reflection of who he is today, opponents of his efforts to throw out more than 60,000 votes in his Supreme Court race see a clear line between his past embrace of Confederate symbols and his voter challenges. Griffin is suing the state Board of Elections in an attempt to invalidate enough votes to unseat incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. Riggs holds a 734-vote lead, which was affirmed in two recounts. Griffin claims the state elections board is counting illegal votes. 
In a statement to the AP, Griffin said his attendance at the “Old South” ball was inappropriate. 
“I attended a college fraternity event that, in hindsight, was inappropriate and does not reflect the person I am today,” Griffin said in his statement to the AP. “At that time, like many college students, I did not fully grasp such participation’s broader historical and social implications. Since then, I have grown, learned, and dedicated myself to values that promote unity, inclusivity, and respect for all people.”
Griffin was the fraternity chapter president in 2002. 
In a 1998 News & Observer “scholars of the week” feature, Griffin, then a high school student, named Robert E. Lee one of three people on his “ideal guest list.”
The state Republican Party is supporting Griffin’s lawsuit. The party’s spokesman, Matt Mercer, did not respond to an email seeking comment, though in an exchange of insults with former Joe Biden spokesman Andrew Bates on social media, Mercer referred to “visiting the wayback machine.”
The state Court of Appeals heard arguments in Griffin’s case last week. The three-judge panel did not indicate when they would issue an opinion. 
Opponents of Griffin’s attempt to erase more than 60,000 votes see a connection between his lawsuit and his past mimicry of Confederate traditions.

“These latest revelations about young Jefferson Griffin only reinforce the deeply problematic character flaws that we see in him now,” said Dawn Blagrove, executive director of the advocacy nonprofit Emancipate NC. 
“It appears even as a child and a young man, he cared nothing about the feelings or constitutional rights of his fellow Americans. He was not committed to inclusion. He was not committed to diversity, and he was not committed to seeing all sides of the situation and having empathy,” she said in an interview.  
“What we are seeing today about Jefferson Griffin from high school and from college has a straight line to the Jefferson Griffin that we see today who is challenging legal votes of 60,000 people,” she said. “And just like the Confederates lost the Civil War, Jefferson Griffin will lose this election.”
Rob Stephens, an organizer with the NC Poor People’s Campaign, said some would argue it doesn’t matter what someone did when he was 20. But here, “Griffin’s campaign is drenched in that same ideology and worldview,” Stephens said. “He’s living out this fantasy of plantation society where the elite are able to control the lives and the futures of everyone else in the racial caste system.”
Military and overseas absentee voters one of the categories of voters Griffin is challenging. But he’s only challenging those votes from a handful of heavily Democratic counties. 
“He wants to go where there are Black voters,” Stephens said. Anyone who denies it “is delusional or is lying to us or lying to themselves,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Griffin-and-NC_SupCourt-1024x596.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma lawmakers advanced bills expanding college scholarships, recess time and school tutoring while approving limits to virtual school days and diversity programs before a key legislative deadline this week.
Bills had to pass their chamber of origin by Thursday, needing approval of the full House or Senate to continue being considered this year.
A variety of legislation impacting schools and students survived the deadline, including measures that are top-of-mind for House and Senate leaders.
House votes to expand Oklahoma’s Promise, recess, school board powers
One of those priority bills is House Bill 1727 to extend the Oklahoma’s Promise college scholarship to children of classroom teachers who have worked in public schools for 10 years or more. The House sent the legislation from Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, to the Senate with a 71-20 vote.
HB 1491, another bill House leadership touted, also heads to the upper chamber after passing 80-16 on Wednesday.
The measure from Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada, would allow two members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education, and of any district school board with five or more members, to place an item on a meeting agenda by submitting a written request. On school boards with four or fewer positions, a single member could add an agenda item.
The bill emerged after recent appointees to the state Board of Education complained that only the board’s chairperson, the state superintendent, has authority over what items are discussed during meetings. 
Johns said he learned it’s been an issue “all the way back to Sandy Garrett,” referring to the former state superintendent who served from 1991 to 2011.

HB 1493, called the Growing Minds, Active Kids Act, is one of the few education bills from a Democrat to pass the full House. Lawmakers approved the legislation from Rep. Jacob Rosecrants, D-Norman, by a vote of 73-12.
Students in pre-K through fifth grade would be required to have 30 minutes of daily recess in addition to the 60 minutes of physical education a week that state law already requires in elementary schools. Current Oklahoma law strongly recommends 20 minutes of daily recess for elementary grade levels but doesn’t require it.
Rosecrants’ bill would strongly recommend 30 minutes of daily recess for grades 6-8.
District school boards could split the elementary and middle-school recess time into segments.  
“There is a prevailing feeling … that you’re really not learning unless you’re in the classroom, and I couldn’t push back more against that,” Rosecrants, a former teacher, said while discussing the bill on the House floor. “Real learning comes from doing. Real learning comes from being outside. That’s how I taught whenever I was in the schools, as well.”
Senate approves anti-DEI bill, online school day limits, tutoring funding
Senate lawmakers on Thursday agreed to codify Gov. Kevin Stitt’s executive order prohibiting state funds from supporting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at higher education institutions.
Questions and debate over the legislation, Senate Bill 796, consumed two hours. The bill’s author, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said equity programs have “the opposite effect of equality” because they raise “one group of people over another based on a perception of what we think historically has happened.”

“Nobody’s denying history,” Pugh said during the Senate debate. “This isn’t about history. This is about our future. And if we ever want to heal, the last thing we need to do is mandate that when someone shows up on campus, we tell them that it’s your fault. History is your fault, and we’re going to fix it for you by making outcomes more equitable.”
Stitt signed his executive order in December 2023 to outlaw college DEI programs, which cost 0.29% of all higher education spending in the state. Student-led programs were unaffected.
Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, said the executive order shut down the women-in-politics program that inspired her to run for office. The University of Oklahoma closed the National Education for Women’s Leadership program last year, citing a need to comply with Stitt’s order.
One of the Senate’s two Black members, Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, debated at length against the bill. She contended it ignores Oklahoma’s history of racial segregation that today makes DEI programs necessary.
“The discrimination continues to happen when you do not want to be diverse,” Goodwin said. “When you don’t want to be equitable, then you champion inequity. And when you don’t want to be inclusive, you want to be exclusive. It’s real simple.”
The measure passed along party lines 39-8.
Senators then took up SB 758, which would limit the use of virtual school days in Oklahoma.

The authors, Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond, and the Senate’s top lawmaker President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, amended their original legislation to change the criteria permitting online learning days for brick-and-mortar schools.
Schools could have up to two online learning days per academic year if the state superintendent approves a virtual instruction plan that the district and its school board submit.
A district’s virtual instruction plan must include how it would serve students with disabilities, provide school meals and transport students to CareerTech classes.
Schools also could rely on virtual days if the governor has issued a state of emergency and the district’s school board approves use of online instruction.
The bill passed 33-14.
“Senate Bill 758 provides the necessary guardrails to keep our schools focused on direct engagement between students and teachers while maintaining a degree of flexibility for truly exceptional circumstances,” Paxton said in a statement.
A bill funding high-dosage tutoring of math and reading passed unanimously through the Senate on Wednesday.
SB 245 from Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, was inspired by a similar program state Superintendent Ryan Walters established through the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
Walters has said the vast majority of students who participated saw academic improvement.
The bill would offer tutors, who are either school employees or contractors, $1,600 total for each cohort of up to four students they meet with for at least three 30-minute tutoring sessions a week. The tutoring sessions would take place after school hours for at least 10 weeks in the fall semester and no less than 12 weeks in the spring. 
The tutors could earn another $1,000 for each academic grade level increase that each student improves in reading or math in one school year.
Students would have to be at least a half grade level behind in reading or math to participate. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee expects the program will cost $5 million, Deevers said.

Tony Evers vetoed a Republican bill Friday that would have undone recent changes to Wisconsin’s state testing standards — taking the state back to those used in 2019 and tying the standards to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).
Lawmakers introduced the bill after changes were approved by state Superintendent Jill Underly last year, who said the changes would better align tests with educational standards and were developed with the help of teachers and other stakeholders as a part of a standard process. However, lawmakers accused Underly of lowering standards for kids. Evers had criticized the process for the changes as well, saying that there should have been better communication between Underly and other stakeholders. 
Evers said in his veto message for AB 1 that while he has criticized the processes for the recent changes, he vetoed the bill because he objects to lawmakers “attempts to undermine the constitutional authority and independence of the state superintendent.” 
Evers noted that the state superintendent is responsible for supervising public schools under the Wisconsin State Constitution and the Legislature is overstepping, and lawmakers had opportunities to provide input to the review and revision. The bill, he said, would “essentially strip control over school scoring and standard metrics away” from the superintendent and give it to the Legislature.
Underly said in a statement that she commends the veto. She said the bill was “deeply flawed as it relied on the NAEP – a federal assessment that is currently being cut by the federal government and is not aligned to Wisconsin’s rigorous standards – to influence local school policies. Most importantly, it undermined the authority of the state superintendent as outlined in Wisconsin’s Constitution.” 
Lawmakers used the veto as an opportunity to criticize Evers and incumbent Superintendent Jill Underly — and to call on Wisconsinites to vote her out of office next week. Underly is running for her second term and faces education consultant and school choice advocate Brittany Kinser, who has cited the changes as a reason that she entered the race, on Tuesday. 
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said in a statement that Evers “failed” students by vetoing the legislation. 
“In January, the governor slammed State Superintendent Underly for lowering standards, but when he had a chance to fix it he chose politics over students,” LeMahieu said. “If 2025 is going to be the ‘Year of the Kid,’ Wisconsin voters will have to make changes at the Department of Public Instruction.”
Kinser said in a statement that “the decision to restore high standards now rests in the hands of Wisconsin voters” and she would “restore high standards” if elected.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House voted overwhelmingly against a bill that would have changed which organizations could conduct charitable gambling.
The bill failed in the House on a 87-4 vote.
Senate Bill 2035 would have changed the definition of public spirited organizations and removed adult amateur athletic and tourism organizations from being able to conduct gambling. Those organizations would have still been able to be the recipients of donated gaming proceeds.
The bill would have also excluded clubs and organizations that contribute directly to its officers or members as a primary beneficiary.

An amended version of the bill would have allowed organizations that support a designated convention center or visitors bureau to continue to operate charitable gambling sites.
The House Education Committee voted unanimously, 13-0, for a do not pass recommendation.
“The committee urges you to vote no based on the lack of cooperation between all the parties involved in coming to some kind of agreement on this issue,” said Rep. Matt Heilman, R-Bismarck, on the House floor.
He said the last question the committee asked the Attorney General’s Office, the office that oversees charitable gambling, was whether the office coordinated on the proposed changes in the bill with the charitable gambling industry and the answer was: No.
“The charitable gaming industry is a massive industry in our state and a key component to many smaller communities,” Heilman said. “Potentially changing the definition in this bill, without all the stakeholders giving their input, would be unfair to the charitable gaming industry.”
He added another reason the committee voted against the bill was the lack of a grandfather clause that would have exempted current charitable gambling organizations.
The bill had passed the Senate in January on a 27-20 vote.

(Video capture courtesy of the Iowa Supreme Court)  An Iowa magistrate who questioned in court whether a defendant was a “wetback” is now facing potential sanctions from the Iowa Supreme Court.
In a harsh, almost brutal, verbal exchange with the Iowa justices on Thursday, Magistrate David J. Hanson said he had not realized the term “wetback” was offensive — a claim the chief justice immediately rejected — before pivoting to a critique of the U.S. Senate hearings, years ago, on the nominations of U.S. Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas.
The Iowa Judicial Qualifications Commission, which hears complaints about judges’ conduct, has recommended that the Iowa Supreme Court suspend Hanson, a part-time magistrate who is based in Fayette County and practiced law for more than 36 years. The recommendation is tied to comments made by Hanson in two separate criminal matters.
Hanson was appointed to the position of magistrate in January 2022. On Aug. 5, 2022, he refused to sign an arrest warrant for a 17-year-old girl in a sexual abuse case in which the alleged victim was a male. According to court records, Hanson reviewed the matter and, with regard to the alleged victim, stated in writing, “The boy will automatically think, ‘Alright! I’m gonna GET some!’”
In denying the warrant application, the commission alleges, Hanson turned to the internet to conduct his own form of “research” and found information that supported his view of the victim’s “innate physical advantage” to conclude that if the victim had wanted to, he could have overpowered the defendant.
The commission argues Hanson’s decision was based on “stereotypical views and observations as to how a male victim of sexual assault should react when allegedly assaulted by a female offender,” and that the order “is unfitting of a judicial officer because it expressed bias (and) included unnecessary and inappropriate commentary about parties.”
Hanson later described his refusal as a “ruling in anger over what I thought was a specious request for an arrest warrant, and I own up to that. If I make a decision and somebody don’t like it, well, I’m sorry.”
In July 2023, Hanson was presiding over a case in which an individual was charged with driving without a license or insurance. A law-student intern who was prosecuting the case later complained that during the proceedings Hanson asked, “Is this guy a wetback? An illegal?”
According to the commission, Hanson also asked whether the prosecutor was sure the defendant, who wasn’t present at the time, hadn’t stolen someone’s identification.
The intern later complained that Hanson’s conduct made her “extremely uncomfortable” and raised concerns that Hanson, due to his use of a “racist slur,” was biased. Hanson later said he didn’t recall the incident and told the commission it could “make whatever decision it wants to make, and I will roll with the punch and take whatever you give me … So just do what you think is right.”
The commission recommended the Iowa Supreme Court impose a 90-day suspension without pay and require Hanson to submit to educational training on anger management and bias.
Chief justice cites ‘damage’ to victims
At Thursday’s hearing before the Iowa Supreme Court, Hanson told the justices that with regard to the allegations made by the victim in the sexual abuse case, “I honestly thought, ‘This is a lie. It reads like bad pornography.’ I hate pornography. Pornography is lies … I still, to this day, am convinced that the arrest warrant request, the complaint, was resting on lies.”
Chief Justice Susan Christensen appeared to bristle at Hanson’s comment and questioned his equation of pornography with lies.

“Sir, are you aware that things that happen to people are pornographic in nature? And sometimes, in order for there to be an arrest warrant, someone might have to give details that are really ugly to give (and) heartbreaking to hear? Just because you’re giving the adjective ‘porn’ — what if those things actually happened to that person? Because it qualifies as porn in your mind and you hate porn, you think it’s a lie?”
“I seriously questioned it,” Hanson replied. “The other problem I had was the utter lack of interest, as far as I could tell, in the policeman attempting to corroborate what the young man said.”
Hanson then likened the decision he faced in that case with what he called the “travesty” of the testimony that was given during the U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings for Justice Kavanaugh in 2018, and for Justice Thomas in 1991.
“Those were lies,” Hanson said, pounding the podium as he addressed the Iowa justices. “Televised lies! And I was appalled by that, and I thought, ‘I will not be an instrument of anyone seeking to destroy someone without any backing up of what (the alleged victim) said here.’ We’re talking about a couple of teenagers who I didn’t encounter and who apparently did some illegal things while they were in the process of it — because that’s what the fact pattern indicated — and I thought, ‘I just don’t see how this is, this is, happening.’”
Christensen appeared to express frustration with Hanson, suggesting he didn’t appear to recognize the issue wasn’t whether he had the right to deny the request for an arrest warrant.
“Do you understand the issue we’re dealing with is the light that you just put the entire Iowa Judicial Branch in?” Christensen asked. “And for you to say, ‘I didn’t say anything that was offensive’ — I am just going to pick one thing out (of the written warrant denial): that any self-respecting young male in this situation would leave the situation and that he probably thought, ‘Alright, I’m gonna get it.’ Now, I am speaking as a former juvenile judge. The amount of damage you did to any juvenile, and especially a male juvenile, to ever be brave enough to step forward say something happened — you may not have believed him. But the way you wrote it and denied it knocked him flat, no doubt. And anybody else who reads this now-public document, how can that not be offensive?”
“Well,” Hanson said, “all I can say is that when this was first run past the Judicial Qualifications Commission, they didn’t see fit to discipline me. I didn’t know what was right or wrong.”
Chief justice: ‘You really think we have to spoon-feed you…?’
As to the second matter involving the case in which Hanson used the term “wetback,” Christensen asked Hanson, “Do you think the term ‘wetback’ is offensive?”
“I’ve learned since using it that it is,” Hanson said. “I grew up in west side, working class Waterloo, and it was fairly common.”
Christensen cut Hanson off, shaking her head and telling him, “You definitely, that one, I am gonna call ‘foul’ on that, that you didn’t know it was offensive.”
Christensen also indicated that at some point during the disciplinary process Hanson appeared to have suggested that someone simply give him a “list of words” considered offensive so that he could avoid saying them in the future.
“Yeah, I think I said that,” Hanson told Christensen.
“You really think we have to spoon-feed you how to say appropriate things in your capacity as a judicial officer?” Christensen asked.
Hanson argued that if he was going to be held to a certain standard, “I need to know what the standard is,” adding that he is “perfectly prepared to meet that standard.”
Christensen then asked Hanson whether he’d ever read the Code of Judicial Conduct prior to beginning his work as a magistrate, indicating the code articulates the standards he must uphold.

Justice Christopher McDonald asked Hanson why, the sex-abuse case, he couldn’t have denied the request for a warrant by simply citing a lack of evidence as opposed to “going out of your way, in my view, to be offensive.” Hanson said he didn’t intend to be offensive and was simply trying to explain the rationale for his decision.
Hanson told the justices he is agreeable to taking whatever educational courses the court might prescribe for him but asked that he not be removed from the bench due to the heavy caseloads in Fayette County.
Christensen questioned that approach, noting that the magistrates who preside over the minor cases heard in associate court represent the only element of the Judicial Branch with which most Iowans will ever have contact.
“You’re suggesting that you continue to work before any of this sensitivity training?” she asked Hanson. “If we put you back out there to continue to preside over cases, knowing what you have put in writing, and knowing what you have done with this black robe that comes with such a responsibility and (knowing) what you have already shown us you’re capable of — how can we do that?”
“I suppose you could remove me entirely,” Hanson said.
Christensen said she was waiting to hear some indication from Hanson that he regretted his actions. In response, Hanson said was sorry “from the depths of my soul” that he had offended others.
Justice David May noted that judges and magistrates are required to ensure that all attorneys and court personnel, in addition to themselves, don’t use racial slurs in court. “I don’t know how to trust you with that responsibility,” May said.
“You are a judge in a robe sittin’ on a bench,” Christensen told Hanson. “I cannot fathom the amount of courage it took for that young law student to rat you out (on behalf of) that 15-year-old student — or, rather, that alleged victim — who was looking for an arrest warrant.”
The court has yet to rule on the commission’s recommendation of a 90-day suspension.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hanson.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Courtesy of Vizguerra family)Lawyers for Jeanette Vizguerra intend to amend her habeas corpus petition, alleging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained her in retaliation for speech that’s protected under the First Amendment.
The amendment would set off new administrative deadlines and could delay the oral arguments in her case for up to a month.
Vizguerra, a nationally known immigration rights activist who lives in Denver, has been in ICE custody at an Aurora facility since March 17, when she was arrested outside her job at Target. Her attorney, Laura Lichter, said in federal court in Denver Friday that public statements and media reports since then make it seem like Vizguerra’s arrest and detention are in response to her activism and public criticism of the country’s immigration policies.

Lichter has until April 8 to amend the petition against Vizguerra’s detention to reflect the First Amendment claim. The government then has 21 days to respond.
A previous order from U.S. District Court Judge Nina Wang blocks attempts by the federal government to deport Vizguerra until oral arguments can be considered. Those arguments were originally set for Friday afternoon.
Vizguerra, 53, has lived in the United States since 1997 after her husband was threatened at gunpoint in Mexico, her home country. Her immigration case stems from a 2009 charge for having a false Social Security number. She was granted an offer of voluntary removal in 2011, left the country in 2012 and came back in 2013, when she was arrested for crossing the border without proper documentation.
She has since been granted several stays of removal, and she took sanctuary in two Denver churches during the first Trump administration to avoid deportation, which made her a high-profile figure in the immigration rights movement.
Federal prosecutors claim that a reinstated order of removal for Vizguerra from 2013 is valid and grounds for her deportation. Vizguerra has argued the order was not properly executed.

Olmscheid/ Senate Media Services.Minnesota Senate Democrats released two-year budget targets Friday that would enact nearly $2.5 billion in cuts over the next four years as the state faces a multi-billion dollar deficit unless lawmakers take action.
The Senate Democratic caucus’ targets say they would leave $2.4 billion on the bottom line over the next two years, and would avert a deficit in the following two-year cycle.
But there’s a major caveat: They don’t account for inflation, which is expected to drive up costs by around $1.1 billion in the upcoming budget, although some economists expect even faster inflation given the Trump administration’s tariffs.
That means cuts will be more widespread and deeper than reflected in the targets, as agencies will face rising costs without money appropriated to cover them. State workers — whose compensation typically comprises the bulk of many agency budgets — are sure to demand pay raises that keep up with inflation, for instance.
Budget targets are guidelines for legislative committees that determine how much money each committee has to spend or needs to cut for the 2026-2027 budget. Targets are subject to change, and often do, as lawmakers create their biennial budget in the remaining weeks of session. The Legislature must pass a budget by June 30, though the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 19.
Minnesota’s increasing costs are outpacing revenues and could cause a projected $6 billion budget deficit in fiscal years 2028-2029. 
Senate Democrats want to avoid the deficit by forcing agencies to eat the cost of inflation. That could lead to staff reductions, program cuts and other cost-saving measures.
The Senate Democrats’ budget targets cut spending on health and human services, environment, energy and transportation, while cutting education in the second biennium.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, said in an interview that the budget targets are based on the latest forecast and don’t take into account cuts at the federal level. Murphy said the state’s $3.2 billion in budget reserves will help Minnesotans fare whatever future federal cuts, freezes and uncertainties affect Minnesota.
“We’ve kept the budget reserve … intact so that we have some cushion and the ability to manage at least some of what we might get from the trifecta in Washington, D.C., that seems hell bent on making deep cuts that could hurt families, schools, communities and our health care system,” Murphy said.
Murphy didn’t offer specifics about how lawmakers will achieve the cuts included in the budget targets.
The Senate Taxes Committee, according to the targets, has a target cutting $365 million from their budget, i.e., by either raising taxes or cutting tax subsidies or Local Government Aid, which is in the Taxes Committee’s purview.
Gov. Tim Walz has proposed lowering the state’s sales tax from 6.875% to 6.8% — saving Minnesotans 75 cents for every $1,000 they spend on taxable goods.
Walz has also proposed taxing professional services that are currently exempt from sales tax, including legal, banking, brokerage and accounting services. Combined, the sales tax changes would generate around $185 million over the next two years.
Murphy would not say whether Walz’s sales tax proposals would be included in the Senate Taxes Committee’s budget target.
The biggest increases in the Senate DFL’s targets include $100 million for the Higher Education Committee and $106 million for the Judiciary and Public Safety Committee.
Murphy said that in higher education, lawmakers will earmark some funds to the Minnesota State Grant program — i.e., college financial aid — which is facing a $211 million budget shortfall.
For the Judiciary and Public Safety Committee, much of the money will go toward the courts and Department of Corrections, Murphy said.
The Minnesota House, which is tied 67-67 between Republicans and Democrats, will present joint budget targets early next week, a House DFL spokesperson said.
Republicans and Democrats had a long running debate about how to treat inflation in state budgets. For many years, Democrats sought to include inflation in the state’s projected costs as a more accurate depiction of the budget outlook.
Inflation is reflected in the rising cost of everything from construction to gasoline to fleet vehicles — and especially in areas where the government spends the most: health care and education, and especially wages. By not including inflationary costs, Democrats argued, the budget forecasts were giving the public a deceptive picture of the government’s ability to provide services.
So, in 2023, Democrats passed a bill to require inflation to be included in both sides of the ledger in the budget forecasts of Minnesota Management and Budget, which is the state’s budget agency.
“If we want to create an honest and responsible budget for Minnesota, we need an honest picture of our state’s finances,” said Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, in 2023. “Just like a weather forecast, we want a budget forecast that has the most accurate information available to us, which will allow us as policymakers to make the most informed decisions possible with our budget. No business would make budget decisions based on budget projections that factor in inflation on the revenue side of their business, but not the expenditure side. Neither should state government.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/250210_AO_0070.jpg_1739384633-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)At the urging of the Secretary of State, West Virginia could tighten laws on acceptable forms of photo identification that can be used at polling places.
The House of Delegates passed a Republican-sponsored measure, House Bill 3016, on Friday that would require a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. It would eliminate several current options accepted at polling places that can validate identity, including a Medicaid card and utility bill.
“What this bill seeks to prevent is voter fraud of any kind to the extent that it’s able,” said Del. J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, who said the Secretary of State’s office said people have voted illegally with a photo ID. “We did hear that,” he said. 
The measure, sponsored by Del. Erica Moore, R-Roane, passed the House with a vote of 84-8. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.
It’s one of several GOP-backed elections bills this session, some supported by Secretary of State Kris Warner, that Republicans say are in order to protect election integrity. House Democrats say conspiracy theories have driven the measures that could keep people from accessing the polls. 
West Virginia has abysmal voter turnout. Opponents of this legislation worry that it will make it difficult, particularly for older West Virginians and those who don’t drive or lack access to the internet, to vote in the state. 
“No evidence exists that a photo voter ID requirement would address any problem. Like non-citizens voting, voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent,” the West Virginia Citizens Action group said in a statement. 
Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, emphasized that the state already has voter ID laws. 
“We haven’t had any issues,” he said. “I think this is likely to disenfranchise some of our older members of our society, and for what? We’re preventing a problem that’s not taking place.”
Bill supporters said West Virginia voters will still have options for proving identification on election days, including a voter registration card with a photo that can be obtained free of charge from a county clerk’s office. A resident must request this option. 
“This bill clarifies that if you request a voter ID from the Secretary of State, it is free of charge,” Akers said.
Del. Gary Howell, R-Mineral, added, “There is no excuse not to have a photo voter registration card, which is a photo ID that can be used to vote, and it secures our election.” 
The measure permits voters 65 and older to use an expired ID, including an expired driver’s license, as long as it was valid on their 65th birthday. Additionally, poll workers may allow a voter, whom the poll worker has known for at least six months, to vote without presenting a valid ID.
Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, said the bill would result in fewer legal West Virginians voting in-person on Election Day or during early in-person voting. 
“Now, the Republican supermajority is … turning their attention to in-person voting,” he said. “Fewer votes will be cast.”
“This is one of a series of bills that restricts West Virginians’ access to vote,” Hansen continued. “We should be passing bills that actually expand people’s right to the ballot and not restrict it.”
Akers said that if people can’t access a photo ID, they can vote using an absentee ballot without a photo ID.
“The ability to vote is not minimized at all,” he said. 
The House already passed House Bill 2117, which would prohibit people from mailing or handing out more than 10 absentee ballot applications to people who did not ask for them, including people who may hand out the applications in nursing homes. 
It would also change how the state handles absentee ballots, including setting a deadline of 7:30 p.m. on Election Day for absentee ballots to be received.

The federal government, under President Donald Trump, announced Tuesday it was revoking $11.4 billion of unspent, leftover, post-pandemic COVID-19 relief funding from state and local governments, $80 million of which is coming from New Hampshire.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” Andrew Nixon, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ director of communications, said in a statement. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”
Gov. Kelly Ayotte told WMUR and others Wednesday that she’s asked the Trump administration to reconsider the decision but was told it is irreversible. State officials believed they would have until the end of 2026 to spend the funding.
“As I understand it, at the federal level, they’re just saying these were pandemic funds and they were only meant to be temporary,” Ayotte, a Republican, said. “And the pandemic’s concluded and we’re gonna claw them back.”
This worsens what was already an extremely difficult budget year for New Hampshire. The state has dealt with years of lagging business tax revenues, is set to be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement money to victims of a yearslong child abuse scandal in its juvenile detention centers, and was already running out of pandemic-era federal funding. Amid these challenges, Ayotte unveiled her $16 billion two-year budget proposal in February. Since then, legislators have been proposing further cuts to that proposal after the House Ways and Means Committee decided her revenue projections were too optimistic by hundreds of millions of dollars.
This week’s cut from the federal government creates a new hole in the state budget that lawmakers will have to figure out how to address. Ayotte said she disagrees with the federal government’s decision to revoke this funding so abruptly.
“Of course I think it is much easier for states if resources have been appropriated for a period that at least we fulfill that period,” Ayotte said.
Effects felt in Tilton
On Friday, U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan met with leaders of community organizations from across the state in Tilton at Archways Community Resource Center to discuss how this will affect their programming, which also relies on the funding that was cut.
“This is about the administration taking away critical things from the American people who need them to give more tax cuts for billionaires who are already billionaires,” Hassan, a Democrat, said.
Archways, as well as several other organizations at the event Friday, were using the federal funding that was revoked to provide a number of services, including those aimed at treating substance use disorder as well as helping people get the Medicaid and SNAP benefits they qualify for.
“These are not just nice things you do for the community,” Michelle Lennon, president and CEO of Archways, said. “There’s evidence that it saves money and it saves lives.”
Lennon said a lot of people don’t realize how difficult it is for those who need welfare services to obtain those services. Her organization relies heavily on federal funding to help people receive their services.
“The assumption is that the resources are readily available, and I can tell you, 99% of the time, they are not,” Lennon said. “The assumption is that, ‘Oh, you can go to town welfare when you’re in trouble and you’re good.’ And it doesn’t work that way. It is so complicated. Rejections come fast and furious, sometimes to the point where we have to engage with legal aid to get people the help they are entitled to as American citizens.”
Among the specific programs being cut is the Health Disparities Grant, which funds employees at Archways who help impoverished people navigate the state’s health care system.
“We have to train our workers in terms of navigating that (system),” Mark Watman, vice president and COO of Archways, said. “These are people who are trained, and it’s still difficult. To have individuals out there trying to navigate this on their own, this is going to be disastrous.”
Watman said the programs that have been supported by this funding “help families survive.”
“The lack of these resources is going to have very practical implications on the health and survivability of New Hampshire families,” he said.
Several leaders of community organizations present Friday said these cuts will devastate their operations at the same time that need in their communities is rising.
“Now that they’ve done this, it’s like, ‘Oh my god, they can do anything to just wreck us overnight,’” Joelyn Drennan, assistant vice president of impact at Granite United Way, said. “And that is super concerning to me, because we are seeing the needs rise, and we’re having such a hard time keeping up with the capacity now.”
“It is one thing to plan for budget cuts in future budgets,” Hassan said. “We go through that at the state level, at the local level, at the federal level all the time. … This is different. This is the administration cutting already committed funds, laying off people in the middle of a budget, doing things that really are going to harm the people of this state and make our communities less able, less resilient to deal with the challenges that they’re facing.”
Hassan said she’s fighting back by spotlighting the importance of the services being cut in New Hampshire, and she’s trying to persuade her Republican colleagues to help the Democrats oppose these actions.

Republican legislative leaders originally hoped to adjourn the 2025 legislative session on March 21. 
But once again, the unfinished 2026 budget is preventing legislators from adjourning. 
One of the only requirements of legislators in the Idaho Constitution is to set a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenue.

When a reporter with the Idaho Capital Sun asked House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, early Friday afternoon for his best guess when the legislative session will end, Moyle said he has no guess and it just depends.
“I would have liked to stay and finish Saturday – I’m not going to lie – push it through and be done,” Moyle told the Sun. “But now it makes it harder, because when you come (back in session) on Monday, they’re going to want to stay the whole week and I don’t want to stay the whole week.”
 Idaho Senate showing signs of disagreements on the floor 

Moyle said his hopes of working into the weekend were dashed when the Idaho Senate wrapped up its daily floor session before noon on Friday and Senate leaders announced their intention to adjourn until Monday while the Idaho House of Representatives was still in session.

Before adjourning for the weekend on Friday, the Idaho Senate showed signs of disagreement and dysfunction, including members of the Senate limiting debate, some senators refusing to answer each other’s questions and, finally, a freshman senator forcing a clerk to read a bill aloud on the floor. For nearly every single bill that comes before the Idaho Legislature, legislators almost always skip the formal full reading of a bill to save time.
“No, guess (when we will finish) because we could have been done today or tomorrow, so it just depends on what happens,” Moyle said.
Moyle said he expects the Idaho House to continue taking up budgets on Monday when legislators reconvene.
“We’ll wait for (the budgets to reach the floor) in here,” Moyle said. “They’ll have them ready for us by Monday, the staff will keep working (drafting the budget bills). They’ll be ready to go… It’s just, we gotta get them done, right? We gotta get them passed. If they don’t pass, some of them have to come back (and be reconsidered). Some of them don’t.”
Major budgets that could reach the floors next week include the colleges and university budgets that seek to reduce funding for Boise State University and the University of Idaho by $2 million each and the budget for Gov. Brad Little’s office. 
The Idaho Senate is scheduled to reconvene at 9:30 a.m. Monday, while the Idaho House of Representatives will reconvene at 10:30 a.m. Monday.
Monday will be the 85th day of the 2025 legislative session. There is no requirement to adjourn legislative sessions by a certain date. However, most sessions run for about 80 to 95 days. 
The 2024 legislative session lasted 94 days, and adjourned for the year April 10.
The 2021 legislative session, which was marked by an extended recess, was the longest in state history. It ran for 311 days and did not adjourn officially until Nov. 15 – just eight weeks before the start of the 2022 legislative session.

(C-SPAN screengrab)Nevada Republican National Committeewoman and former political candidate Sigal Chattah  has been nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as interim U.S. Attorney in Nevada, her office confirmed Friday.
The interim status will be removed if she is confirmed by the Senate.
In a post on X, Nevada Republican Party chairman Michael McDonald said Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi “have the warrior they need in Nevada. Sigal will rigorously advocate for the President’s priorities and investigate corruption throughout the Silver State.”
Chattah did not respond to phone calls or texts seeking comment on her nomination.  
“Sigal is a fierce defender of personal liberties, best known for her work reopening churches in Nevada after their unconstitutional shutdown,” the Nevada Republican Party said on X. 
During her unsuccessful run in 2022 for Nevada attorney general, Chattah declared her Democratic opponent, incumbent Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Black man, “should be hanging from a f–king crane”; longed for fewer “pronoun badges” and transgender individuals in America, while describing them with an offensive slur; and invited comparisons with Sen. Joe McCarthy and former Pres. Donald Trump by calling for the imprisonment of political foes. 
Chattah insists she never considered apologizing to Ford for what was widely viewed as a racist comment.  
“I think he’s a corrupt public official and I think he’s betrayed Nevadans. I’m not going to apologize for that,” she said. 
While campaigning in the AG race, Chattah told the Current that if elected, she’d be a bipartisan nightmare for anyone engaged in public corruption, adding she’d “absolutely” investigate Trump as well as Nevada’s fake electors. “I don’t care whether you have an ‘R’ or a ‘D’ by your name. If you’re in a criminal enterprise, public corruption, you’re getting investigated.”
As a candidate, Chattah pledged to “protect Nevadans’ lawful right to keep and bear arms” and “uphold the Constitutional rights to peaceable assembly and petition the government for a redress of grievances.”  
In an opinion column in January, Chattah blamed President Barack Obama for “gross abuses of the Patriot Act,” resulting in the proliferation of domestic terrorism rooted in Islam. “At best, this encore administration has four years to correct the course of the last 15 years of homegrown Islamic threats to America.”

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — An activist facing deportation after leading pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia University’s campus will remain in custody as a federal judge decides whether New Jersey’s federal court system is the proper venue for his case.
Judge Michael Farbiarz said after a Friday hearing that he would decide “as quickly” as he can on whether Mahmoud Khalil’s plea to be freed from detention should be heard in New Jersey or moved to Louisiana, where he’s currently being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump administration wants the case heard in Louisiana.
Attorneys for Khalil and the federal government appeared before Farbiarz Friday for nearly 90 minutes to argue over which court has jurisdiction over the case. Khalil’s wife, Noor, who is eight months pregnant, sat in the first row of the crowded courtroom that was filled with media, attorneys, and Khalil’s friends.
The judge’s decision on jurisdiction will come before any hearing on Khalil’s petition to be released from detention.
Khalil, a Syrian native, is a green card holder who has not been charged with a crime.
After immigration officers arrested Khalil in New York City March 8, he was transferred to the Elizabeth Detention Center in New Jersey. That’s where he filed his bid to be released — known as a writ of habeas corpus — with a federal court in Manhattan. Khalil was then taken to a detention center in Louisiana.
Last week, Judge Jesse Furman in the Southern District of New York said he doesn’t have jurisdiction over the case because Khalil filed his petition for release while he was in New Jersey, so Furman transferred the case here. The Trump administration opposed moving Khalil’s case to New Jersey.
Khalil has been held in Louisiana for roughly three weeks, and is set to appear before an immigration judge April 8.











































































































Bahar Azmy, one of Khalil’s lawyers, told Farbiarz that Khalil’s arrest is rooted in the government’s aim to “retaliate” against his free speech. Khalil was an outspoken leader of anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus last spring.
Azmy accused federal prosecutors of “forum shopping” to get the case before a more sympathetic judge. Azmy noted that Rumeysa Ozturk, a student at Tufts University who was taken into custody by immigration officials this week, was sent to a Louisiana detention center despite a court order barring the transfer.
A ruling in the government’s favor in Khalil’s case could have a “chilling” effect as more university students are picked up by immigration enforcement officials who would feel free to send them far from their families and legal teams, he said.
August Flentje, an attorney representing the Trump administration, noted that Khalil was only in New Jersey for “a few hours” before moving to Louisiana.
Flentje told the judge there is no intention to move Khalil again right now, and that it “made no good sense to transfer the case to this court, where Mr. Khalil is not detained.”
“Our view is, for jurisdictional certainty, this case belongs in Louisiana,” said Flentje, who declined to speak to reporters outside the courthouse.
The Trump administration has said that Khalil and other students involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests should have their visas or residency statuses revoked because they showed support for terrorist organization Hamas.
Azmy told reporters after the hearing that argument has “dangerous” implications.
“This is a case where the United States government has created a policy targeting Palestinian activists, and specifically for Mahmoud Khalil, for arrest, detention and potential removal because the United States government disagrees with his constitutionally protected right to dissent from U.S. foreign policy,” he said.
During the hearing, hundreds of protestors rallied outside the courthouse in support of Khalil, waving Palestine flags and holding signs reading, “ICE off our campuses” and “Release Mahmoud Khalil!”
Khalil’s legal team praised the judge for his “smart” questions and said they believe the ruling will be in their favor. One of his attorneys, Ramzi Kassem, said the goal is to get Khalil released in time to witness the birth of his first child.
“Every day matters, and that’s why we’re leaving no stone unturned,” he said. “We have a number of motions pending with the court, and we hope the court will agree with us on jurisdiction so that we can move forward on those motions.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)At the beginning of the 60-day legislative session, housing advocate Winter Torres remembers feeling like the issue of housing affordability and homelessness had reached such a crescendo that lawmakers were jumping over each other to introduce bills.
By the session’s midpoint, housing advocates watching the session closely said they were tracking more than 60 bills, a huge increase over previous years. Lawmakers introduced nearly 200 bills mentioning the word “housing” this session. That’s the most since at least 2005. 
“There’s never been bills like this,” said Torres, who runs an eviction diversion program in Santa Fe and also tracks housing-related legislation on her website during the session. “People just came out of the woodwork with them.”
But now that the session is over, Torres said she can’t help but feel like the Legislature missed a chance to catch up to other states’ efforts to reform housing policies and address the crisis here before it gets worse. 
The state lacks more than 32,000 housing units, homelessness is on the rise and federal cuts threaten to deprive housing aid to thousands of New Mexicans.
“I feel disappointed,” she said. “Some of the other advocates may have a different view, but I feel like, you know, we had our shot.”
Legislative leaders have touted this year’s session as building on recent record investments in making housing more affordable and building more of it. Lawmakers last year appropriated nearly $200 million for various housing projects and programs. 
This year, lawmakers have earmarked at least $140 million for housing programs, including up to $80 million of that for Albuquerque and Bernalillo County.
Outside of the budget, both chambers of the Legislature also passed 21 bills mentioning “housing,” including Senate Bill 267, which caps late and application fees for renters, and House Bill 571, which creates incentives for municipalities that reform their zoning codes in ways that expands the construction of affordable housing.
Another bill creates a new governing subdivision to oversee the New Mexico State Fair grounds and empowers it to study the feasibility of building new housing there. 
Torres said she doesn’t want to minimize those significant bills, but the way other bills were moving early on in the session made their eventual deaths more frustrating. For example, a House bill that would have prohibited landlords from turning away tenants who carry Section 8 vouchers failed early in committees in at least the last two previous sessions, but this year made it all the way to its final Senate committee, Senate Judiciary, where it never received a hearing. 
Other House bills she tracked also died in Senate Judiciary, their final hurdle before the Senate floor, including ones that would have expunged old eviction records or given mobile home park tenants a chance to buy their park if it goes up for sale. 
New Mexico governor once again tries to create Office of Housing

“Fundamentally, I think the way we do sessions is an extremely irresponsible way to make law, when we are so far behind the rest of the nation on so many things, and the rest of the world just keeps speeding up,” she said. “We’ll never catch up.”
Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) sponsored several housing bills and joined a working group with other lawmakers to discuss and propose housing-related legislation. She said the Legislature was abuzz with housing-related energy at the beginning and is proud to have supported another year of significant investments in housing and homelessness. 
Still, Cates also said significant legislation she supported languished without hearings, primarily in Senate Judiciary
“That’s where everything dies, Senate Judiciary,” she said. “It’s ridiculous.”
Sen. Joseph Cervantes, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, did not respond to a request for comment on Friday afternoon from Source New Mexico.
Other prominent housing-related bills that died this session include one that would have created a new  Office of Housing, Planning and Production in the executive branch. Advocates say the office is necessary to collect better data and coordinate various government agencies into a unified statewide strategy. That bill also made it to its final committee hurdle, Senate Finance, without being heard.
“Our priority bill SB205…had amazing support, compelling testimony, and endorsements from diverse organizations around the state. We won bipartisan support in four committee hearings and passed the House 49-17,” Daniel Werwath, housing policy adviser to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, wrote in an email to supporters on the last day of the session. “Sadly, in the last few days of the session, the Senate Finance Committee chose not to hear our bill and denied us a vote on the Senate floor.”
Werwath declined an interview request with Source New Mexico until after the governor decides which bills to sign, but his same email pointed to the money in the budget for housing and also HB571 as reason to call the session a success. 
“While we failed to win statutory authority for the Office, this doesn’t change our work,” Werwath wrote. “With record funding and mandates to work on statewide housing regulatory frameworks through HB571 …we will continue to work to ensure that state investments in housing are delivered quickly, efficiently and with a focus on innovation and outcomes.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9539-1024x964.jpg,,,2025-03-28 18:04:08.603765

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — On the last day of the legislative session, the League of Women Voters of Kentucky renewed its calls for more transparency in how the General Assembly makes laws and sets policies.
Gathered in the Capitol Rotunda Friday, speakers highlighted the “Democracy Principle,” or the idea that citizens have a right to be involved in the legislative process and have their voices heard and considered. Citizens are being shut out of the process, the League contends, because the General Assembly uses fast-track maneuvers to speed bills into law, often counter to its own rules, and with little public notice or participation.
  The League of Women Voters of Kentucky highlighted the Democracy Principle during a Capitol rally. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)
The Kentucky chapter of the national organization has been tracking what it says are legislative maneuvers that undermine democracy and in 2023 issued a report,“How Can They Do That? Transparency and Citizen Participation in Kentucky’s Legislative Process.” It analyzed seven 60-day legislative sessions between 1998 and 2022 and found many instances when  the General Assembly did not follow its established process to give Kentuckians time to review and comment on proposed legislation. 
Ahead of the 2025 session, the League updated its report and found Kentuckians are still regularly shut out of legislative decisions that affect them. 
On Friday, the League pointed to six bills in the 2025 session as examples of fast-tracking, including House Bill 4, which eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion at Kentucky’s public universities.  The League also pointed to  Senate Bill 202, which began as a short, insignificant “shell bill” and quickly changed to ban the sale of hemp-derived beverages in the state until summer of 2026. The bill then was changed into its final form which places a 5 milligram limit on “intoxicating adult-use cannabinoids” in a 12 ounce beverage. 
Some of the “fast-track maneuvers” used to move legislation, the League said, included giving bills floor readings before they were heard in committee, introducing a committee substitute at the last minute, having an irregularly scheduled committee hearing, and giving a bill a floor vote the same day it was heard in  committee.
Ridhi Penmecha, a high school student and member of the Kentucky Student Voice Team (KSVT), said during the Friday rally that students advocating in Frankfort have encountered obstacles that make it “nearly impossible” for them to engage in the legislative process, despite their eagerness to be heard. Shortly after this legislative session began, KSVT filed a lawsuit alleging the state and General Assembly “have failed to maintain the level of commitment to education required” by Kentucky’s Constitution and past court decisions. 
“We’re not just being excluded from the present, but we are being cut out of shaping the future,” she said.

In her closing thoughts Friday, Becky Jones, the LWVKY’s first vice president, responded to a comment Republican Senate President Robert Stivers made Thursday on the Senate floor. He said if people “want to change the policy in this state, then they will change the makeup of this body.” 
“On that we agree,” Jones told the crowd, who then applauded. 
In recent months, the League has faced gripes from Kentucky Republicans who question whether it  is truly nonpartisan and who say the group is made up  largely of liberal Democrats.  The GOP holds a veto-proof supermajority in the House and Senate. 
When asked if she’s concerned the conversation about legislative transparency is becoming hyper-partisan, Jones told reporters “it could” and said that would be “an unfortunate circumstance.” She emphasized that the League does not endorse political parties or candidates. 
“It’s unfortunate when being political gets misconstrued with being partisan,” Jones said. “There is nothing partisan about protecting the process. That is political, just like fighting for the right to vote was a very political action, and that’s the foundation that we stand on.” 
The national League of Women Voters was founded after the 19th Amendment was ratified to help women navigate their new access to the ballot. 
In a Thursday press conference, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear echoed complaints by Democratic lawmakers about a lack of transparency in how Republican leaders moved legislation in this session.  Republicans have rebuked the notion, saying that time is limited in  a short 30-day legislative session, such as the one that adjourned sine die on Friday.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Each year, pregnancy centers in South Carolina administer more than 10,000 free pregnancy tests, more than 5,000 ultrasounds and more than 1,600 tests for sexually transmitted diseases and infections, according to administrators.
Statistics from these centers, which aim to deter pregnant women from having an abortion, come as some legislators question how the centers have spent millions in state dollars funneled to them in the last three state budgets.

Due to lax reporting requirements for these and other non-profit recipients of state dollars, the only information made available previously is that the money paid for “provision of pregnancy related care and resources,” as written on a form provided to the state’s Medicaid agency.
Now, in addition to $8 million in the last three budgets and $2.4 million proposed in the coming budget year, legislators are considering state income tax breaks for South Carolinians who make donations to these centers.
Speaking in favor of the tax credits that could encourage more private donations, as well as state budget funding, Kathryn Wade, chairwoman of the association that represents 18 such centers around the state, said the association divided past dollars among 15 of its member centers.
The statistics on services Wade provided are from 2022, before the centers received state money and before the Legislature enacted the state’s so-called “fetal heartbeat” law that essentially bans abortions six weeks into a pregnancy, though that timeline is the subject of a legal challenge before the state Supreme Court.
How SC Supreme Court defines ‘fetal heartbeat’ could reset abortion ban at 9 weeks

“We’ve only increased in our ability to provide these services,” Wade told a Senate panel last week.
Wade went on to say that when the centers received the state funds, legislators and state agency personnel gave little guidance on how the centers could spend it.
“The first year was probably the most difficult because we were scared to spend it on anything,” Wade said.
Her comments to senators came the day after Rep. Heather Bauer criticized the meager information provided in state-mandated reports.
“It’s very vague at best. I think we deserve to know what they’re using their money on,” the Columbia Democrat said. “How many people have they helped? What kind of resources and programing are they giving these people? And I’d like to see evidence of what outcomes they have for pregnant women in our state.”
Bauer gave the example of a travel van, owned by non-profit A Moment of Hope, which parks in the parking lot of Columbia’s Planned Parenthood clinic and seeks to divert and dissuade women from entering the clinic.

But according to A Moment of Hope director Mark Baumgartner, his organization is not a member of the pregnancy center association, and therefore not a recipient of state funding.
But he told legislators the tax credits under consideration would be beneficial to his group, which he said has worked with nearly 400 pregnant women since its foundation in 2012. That includes the ultrasound van, as well as church-based teams who, for a year during a woman’s pregnancy, drive her to doctors’ appointments, throw her a baby shower, do weekly check-ins and invite her to prayer groups and church functions.
When it comes to the pregnancy center association, Wade said the group has “reported what we were instructed to report.”
The association also hired an executive director to oversee where the money is going and an attorney who drew up a contract with member centers saying they would not spend the funds on executive salaries.
In addition to testing and ultrasounds, Wade said the centers offer parenting and prenatal classes, which she valued at $2.6 million annually. The centers also hand out donated diapers, cribs and clothing.
A dozen of the centers, Wade said, are staffed by registered nurses, physicians assistants or nursing assistants. The state funding, she said, has prompted more centers to consider adding ultrasounds to their list of services, as well as researching the potential for opening more centers in rural areas.
“Ultrasounds and pregnancy tests do not equate to medical help,” Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Vicki Ringer told legislators in opposing the tax credits. “We have got to provide better health care for women who are pregnant and for the babies than they have.”
And when it comes to state income taxes, the only credits currently given for charitable contributions are related to donations of venison to food pantries and monetary donations to a fund for education of special needs children.
The bill, which the full Senate Finance Committee advanced Tuesday to the Senate floor, would add pregnancy centers, maternity homes, foster care and adoption charities and organizations that aid victims of human trafficking to that short list.
The state’s fiscal analysts estimate the tax credit could reduce state revenues by $10 million annually. That estimate only accounts for donations to crisis pregnancy care centers and adoption and foster care charities.
Planned Parenthood provides ultrasounds, pregnancy tests, and STD testing, as well as birth control, cancer screenings and vaccines. But because it also provides abortions, donations to the organization are ineligible for tax deductions.
“There are 33,000 nonprofits in South Carolina and we’ve cherrypicked one group to give contributions to,” said Ringer, who was spokeswoman for the state’s tax collection agency before joining Planned Parenthood.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1132562606-scaled-1-1024x724.jpg,,,2025-03-28 17:05:01.568880

(Photo by Kris Hanning/University of Arizona)When Stephanie Russo Carroll, a citizen of the Native Village of Kluti-Kaah in Alaska, set out to earn her doctorate in tribal health 15 years ago, she focused her research on tribal cultural and health programs within six tribes.
She needed vital statistics data, such as birth and death rates, for each of them. But getting that data from the state, which houses vital statistics, was difficult — and in some cases, the data she needed was missing.
“Health outcomes data were unobtainable,” Carroll recalled. In one case, her team had to try using breastfeeding rates as a proxy to estimate birth rates. But even getting those for all six tribes was impossible.
For the next two decades, Carroll would continue to push for U.S. tribes — which are sovereign nations — to own and maintain control over their data, including health statistics.
The concept, known as data sovereignty, is important amid the harrowing health disparities seen in tribal people, rooted in forced assimilation dating back more than a century. Often, data gathered by and about tribes has been shared with state and federal agencies; but those same agencies haven’t always shared their tribal-related statistics in return.
The reasons vary, from systemic issues within the health care system to mistaken assumptions by some federal officials about what data be securely sent to tribes without risking privacy violations.

The lack of tribe-specific data has hindered tribes from fully taking care of their members and clouded their work on public health responses to disease outbreaks such as syphilis and COVID-19, on maternal and infant health outcomes, and on chronic issues such as diabetes, heart disease and substance use.
Data sovereignty is especially relevant now, as the Trump administration scrubs federal health websites of data that recognizes and tracks metrics among the country’s various racial and ethnic groups, including what little data there is on tribal members.
States govern their own health data systems. But the same isn’t true for the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes.
Now an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, Carroll co-founded the U.S. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network and directs the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance. Both are groups that work to research and strengthen Indigenous data governance, accuracy and data-driven policy.
“If you don’t know who has been sick or hospitalized,” Carroll said, “how can you make sure you have the right care systems for your community?”
Withholding tribes’ data
As part of its slashing of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Trump administration removed numerous racial, ethnic, adolescent and maternal health datasets from the websites of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While some of the data has been reinstated, the swift deletions raised alarms in tribal communities.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, said the youth behavioral risk surveys were reinstated, but were missing key race and ethnicity search features that tribes use to track mental health conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native teens.
“Now, we can’t search, disaggregate by Native youth,” she said. “That information is about our children, and it is the legal right of both now the tribal epidemiology centers and the tribes to have access to that previously gathered information.”

	Despite their public health authority, tribes and tribal epidemiology centers, which support tribes with health data tracking, say federal and state health officials have long withheld or denied requests to direct access of health data related to their tribes, including coronavirus data during the pandemic.
Such data is tied to treaty rights obligations and shouldn’t be lumped together with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently under attack by the Trump administration, Echo-Hawk said.
“Our treaty rights are tied to having information around tribal people. So, if you’re going to uphold our treaty rights, you need to say: ‘This number of Native people are experiencing this issue,’ or ‘This number of Native people exist,’” she said.
It wasn’t until 2021 that the CDC conducted its first comprehensive life expectancy profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives; it showed that in 2019, their life expectancy was seven years lower than that of white people.
“All of the data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being,” Echo-Hawk said.
When tribes receive federal grants — whether for transportation, housing or education initiatives — there are grant reporting requirements.




All of data is a story. It’s a grandmother, it’s a son, it’s a story of a community’s well-being.


– Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Public Health Institute



Under those rules, tribes send raw data to federal agencies, but they often don’t get that data back, said social demographer Desi Small-Rodriguez, an assistant professor of sociology and American Indian studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-founded the data sovereignty network with Carroll.
“It’s a one-way data highway coming from tribal governments — leaving tribal governments and going into the feds — and it’s not coming back,” said Small-Rodriguez. She also directs the Data Warriors Lab, working with tribes — including her own Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana — to develop legal mechanisms to ensure data ownership.
She said the federal government should provide funding, as part of its treaty obligations, to pay for expensive data support such as secure storage systems, high-performance computers and analytics staff.
“As part of our treaty rights, we have a right to health care and education. We have a right to clean water and air — and data form the basis for all of that,” she said.
State data agreements
In January, the Tulalip Tribes in northwest Washington state secured a data-sharing agreement with the state department of health. It gives the tribes access to the state’s disease reporting system, allowing them to extract some data directly. Tulalip plans to eventually secure access to more datasets.
It’s the first agreement of its kind in the state, said Summer Hammons, legislative policy analyst in the Treaty Rights and Governmental Affairs Department of the Tulalip Tribes, which has at least 5,000 members. Hammons grew up on the reservation.
She hopes it will help the tribe direct resources and funds where they’re needed — whether it’s more cancer screenings or vaccinations against diseases such as measles, as other states grapple with outbreaks of the virus.
“It allows us to collaborate and lead on outbreak investigations related to tribal members,” Hammons said. “It’s a clear outline that tribes own their data in partnership with the state, because the state’s the one that’s collecting it. But we want to tell our story, and we want to be able to work with DOH [department of health] to be mindful of our stories and to also get better access to the statistics.”

A few other states — Alaska, Arizona, Oregon and South Dakota — also have limited-scope agreements with tribes.
Gary Ferguson, Unangax (Aleut), is the director of integrative medicine at Tulalip Health Clinic. He said he hopes the data will help the tribe track health care interventions over time.
“We don’t know what’s working. We don’t know what’s not working,” he said. “We want to celebrate our wins.”
Tracking disease
In recent years, the nation has seen alarming surges in congenital syphilis, a preventable infection passed through pregnancy to newborns. Nearly 40% can be stillborn or die as a newborn. Babies can also suffer lifelong blindness or deafness. Tribal babies suffer the highest rate.
Officials at the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, which tracks tribal public health across four states, were denied syphilis data from local public health departments for years until the group leaned on the CDC for assistance.
It wasn’t until then that, finally, last year, one state — South Dakota — agreed to share American Indian and Alaska Native syphilis cases as soon as they’re reported, said Sarah Shewbrooks, the group’s lead tribal epidemiologist.
Shewbrooks hopes the access in South Dakota will pave the way for more agreements in the other Great Plains states.
‘We needed this yesterday’
During COVID-19, American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely to be infected and compared with white people, had double the risk of in-hospital death and three times the rate of severe infection, research shows. Yet even then, data weren’t telling the whole story.
Echo-Hawk’s organization published a report card in 2021 that scored each state’s collection of Natives’ COVID-19 cases. In total, the nation averaged a D+. This year, she published a follow-up for epidemiologists on addressing the misclassification of Native people, who often are listed as “white” or “Hispanic” in health settings and death certificates. Many states also inconsistently or don’t report tribal affiliation on death certificates, which can make tribe-specific death rates elusive.
A report in 2021 from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found that some officials from the CDC and the Indian Health Services agency didn’t recognize that they were required by law to share data with tribal epidemiology centers, the centers told investigators.
In the GAO report, investigators detailed logistical barriers, including federal agencies’ reluctance to share COVID-19 data because of concerns around privacy and security in data transmission.
“This is one of the best examples of what structural racism looks like,” said Shewbrooks. “Because when you look at the infrastructure for public health systems and public health data, tribes and [tribal epidemiology centers] were never included in that infrastructure.
“COVID really put it up there as: No, we needed this yesterday.”
Shewbrooks said that as part of her work she’d go to funeral directors, who may fill out death certificates, throughout the region to educate them on proper classification of American Indian people. “I even had one say to me once, ‘I just always code them by how they look. I never ask what their race is.’”
“A lot of them didn’t know that this is data that gets really used,” she said. “Vital records data is just super important, foundational work in a lot of epidemiological work.”

	There is no national standard for tribal health data, explained Cheryl Ellenwood, who is a citizen of the Nez Perce Nation and also Diné (Navajo).
Ellenwood, an assistant professor in Washington State University’s School of Politics, Philosophy and Public Affairs, experienced firsthand the data disconnect when both her parents died of COVID-19.
Four years ago this month, her mother, Annie Benally Ellenwood, an enrolled Navajo tribal member from New Mexico, died at age 71 in a hospital in Idaho. Annie Ellenwood’s death, however, wouldn’t show up in primary statistics of COVID-19 deaths in Navajo people — her tribe isn’t listed on her death certificate.
“I was very hurt by this, because my mother died because of COVID-19, and I wanted her death to count and mean something,” Ellenwood said.
“It still feels very life and death, like we are fighting to demonstrate the impact of so many things on our people,” she said.

The attorney general’s office will be able to enforce the act so Colorado voters don’t need to depend on the federal government to enforce the VRA.

Gonzales sponsored the bill in the Senate, where it will need to pass one more vote before it goes to the Colorado House of Representatives for further debate. House sponsors are Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat, and Rep. Junie Joseph, a Boulder Democrat. Democrats hold strong majorities in both chambers.
Gonzales introduced several clarifying amendments, one of which says that if a voter files a complaint about a violation in a county other than the one where they reside, the Denver District Court would adjudicate the matter. 
Over an hour of debate was spent on Republican amendments to the bill to require the secretary of state to notify county clerks, the governor and the attorney general of any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive election information, such as voting machine passwords. 
Before the 2024 election, a worksheet containing election equipment passwords was inadvertently posted to the Colorado secretary of state’s website. While county clerks said that election security in the state remained strong following the breach, many were upset that Griswold did not inform them about the breach until after the Colorado Republican Party learned about and announced it.
The Senate adopted a version of the amendment that requires written notification within seven days of discovery of any such breach, after a proposal to require immediate notification was withdrawn. If a breach occurs within three weeks of an election, the secretary of state must send notice within 48 hours. 
Another amendment the Senate approved, introduced by Minority Leader Paul Lundeen of Monument, requires a process to ensure voters who cannot vote in person in primary elections — such as military personnel who are overseas — can still participate. Gonzales supported the amendment.

Getty imageA proposal to protect access to in-vitro fertilization has been sent to the governor as Georgia lawmakers are proposing a similar measure to protect the right to contraception.
Bipartisan calls to shore up access to IVF began in the wake of an Alabama Supreme Court ruling last year that declared frozen embryos children. The ruling temporarily closed clinics there and created uncertainty nationally.
Georgia’s bill, House Bill 428, glided through the Legislature thanks to support from the state’s most powerful Republicans, including House Speaker Jon Burns, who made the bill one of his priorities for the year.

“We’re one step closer to codifying access to IVF and ensuring that every family in our state facing infertility will never have a question about their access to this life-changing treatment,” Burns told reporters Friday.
The House finalized the bill Friday after the Senate tweaked it this week. Both chambers overwhelmingly passed the measure, and Gov. Brian Kemp has said he supports adding protection for the fertilization treatment.
The bill, sponsored by Statesboro Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, defines IVF in state code and says a person cannot be prevented from obtaining the treatment.
Franklin has openly shared his personal story as he has shepherded the bill through the legislative process. He and his wife Lorie struggled to build their family but are now expecting their first child because of IVF.
The bill’s final passage also happened days after House lawmakers held a more than two-hour hearing on House Bill 441, which would expand Georgia’s law to completely ban abortion and charge people with murder for terminating a pregnancy.
Several doctors who spoke at the hearing warned lawmakers that the proposal would end IVF treatment in Georgia. 
When asked about the hearing and that bill’s prospects Friday, Burns told reporters that there’s “nothing that we can’t talk about in the House.” 
“We’ll continue conversations about a wide range of subjects over the remainder of this session and the years to come,” Burns said. “Like all Georgians and like all individuals, we don’t necessarily agree 100% on everything, but I think we’ve worked towards a common good and a common goal, and that’s to make sure we ensure and protect life in Georgia.” 
New proposal would protect access to contraception
A new House bill filed this week mirrors the IVF bill and extends protections to contraception.  
Rep. Sharon Cooper, a Marietta Republican who chairs the House Public and Community Health Committee, said Friday that she filed House Bill 872 because she thought contraception was being left out of the broader conversation about reproductive rights. She said she sees it as a proactive measure.
Contraceptives are commonly used by girls and women throughout their lifetime and for a range of purposes, whether it’s for acne, managing pain, spacing out pregnancies or other reasons.
“They play a major role in a woman’s life,” Cooper said.
Cooper’s bill was filed Thursday with more than a dozen signatures of Republican women lawmakers, including Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones. With the last day of the 2025 legislative session set for next Friday, rushing it through this year would be a tall order, but it will remain in play for next year. 
Jones, a Milton Republican, said the bill is more about addressing the perception that access to contraception could be in jeopardy.
“This certainly makes it clear that contraception is not up for grabs,” Jones said. “It’s very important to women all over Georgia, and we stand with them, and we are making it clear, whether it passes this year or next year, that the right to contraception is protected and honored in Georgia.” 
Democratic lawmakers and advocates began raising alarm bells about access to contraception after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. 
At the time, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion that the justices should reconsider all the precedents that rely on the substantive due process legal reasoning that kept abortion legal nationwide for nearly half a century. He specifically cited the 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut ruling that recognized married couples’ right to use contraception.
In Georgia, Democrats filed bills last year attempting to protect access to contraception and IVF in the wake of the Alabama ruling.

U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta, an Obama appointee in the District of Columbia, found unlawful a 73-million acre offshore oil and gas lease sale, one of the largest in history, that the Interior Department held in March 2023. Oil and gas leases are contracts in which private companies rent tracts of federal land or water from the government usually for the purposes of drilling or extracting raw materials.
The court ruled in favor of groups that had sued the Interior Department, finding that the agency failed to adequately consider the potential harms of climate changing emissions from fossil fuel production arising out of the lease as well as the impact to the nearly-extinct Rice’s whale, which lives exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. The most recent scientific survey in 2017-18 estimated that only about 50 of the endangered whales are still alive, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Gulf energy industry could face challenges with some of Trump’s promises

The judge ordered additional briefing from the parties regarding what remedies the court should impose.
The Interior Department, through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management under the Biden administration, had previously canceled the lease sale nearly three years ago. However, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia, inserted a provision into the Inflation Reduction Act that forced the Interior Department to resurrect the sales along with two others that were similarly canceled. Separate litigation remains ongoing to decide the fate of the two other sales, one in the Gulf of Mexico and the other in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).
The next Gulf oil and gas lease is scheduled for auction in 2025, and two others are proposed to take place over the next five years. After leases are sold, it typically takes many years before platforms and other infrastructure are built and drilling begins. 
For various reasons, some companies purchase leases and don’t use them at all. Hundreds of oil and gas leases currently sit idle as fuel prices have been relatively stable for several years on the global energy market. The last oil and gas lease auction in ANWR this year drew no bids.

The lawsuit accuses longtime Billings Police Chief Rich St. John, both in his personal and professional capacity, of robbing Anderson Towing Company of due process, and helping former District Court Judge Russ Fagg in a vendetta against the company, which recorded several interactions and has presented them as exhibits.
Fagg, an institution in Billings along with his family, is at the heart of the lawsuit, having had a Mercedes sedan registered to his father towed after a traffic accident.
That led to a profanity-dotted encounter with several employees of Anderson Towing, allegations of price gouging, and “playing the judge card.” According to the lawsuit, that situation has led the state’s largest police department to ban a company from ever working for the city again.
A former police officer has also filed depositions in the case alleging Fagg and high-ranking members of the approximately 150-person department are close friends, going on annual horseback riding trips, and that Fagg has used those connections to conspire against the company, based on the premise that towing company was price gouging, something the company denies in the lawsuit.
The current controversy began on Feb. 8, but some of the allegations stretch back into November 2024, when the city suspended the towing company for two weeks.
Anderson Towing received a call from the Billings Police Department in the middle of the day for a traffic accident at the intersection of 6th Avenue North and North 27th Street in Billings, and the pictures show a Mercedes sedan and a good amount of snow. The company towed the vehicle, and two days later Fagg came to retrieve the car on Feb. 11.
That led to a dispute that started when the company informed the former judge that it only accepted cash or a cashier’s check, and he insisted on paying by credit card or personal check.
“That’s the kind of bullshit that you didn’t tell me a half-hour ago,” Fagg said.
“Sir, I didn’t speak to you, so please don’t cuss at me,” an employee told him.

The general manager shortly intervened and told Fagg the company’s policy was a result of “being burned too many times.”
During the conversation, the towing company officials also told Fagg the vehicle’s registration was expired and that the car was registered to someone else, later identified as Fagg’s father, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court. The towing company said it couldn’t release the vehicle without the proper paperwork to prevent vehicle theft or releasing a vehicle to the wrong person.
The towing company said it could retrieve an updated registration from the Montana Motor Vehicle Department, but would carry an additional $100 fee. Fagg then insisted on speaking with the towing company’s owner, according to the lawsuit, and made the following statement: “I hate to play this card — I was a district court judge for 22 years. I’m a lawyer in this town. There’s no damn way I am going to skip out on this bill.”
Eventually, Fagg paid the bill for $1,737.47.
The next day, Fagg, a former state legislator and unsuccessful candidate for federal office, filed a formal complaint against the company with the Montana Office of Consumer Protection in Helena.
“Judge Fagg’s complaint did not mention his credit card and personal check being rejected. Instead, he solely complained about the charges,” the lawsuit said.
The day after, Fagg wrote the City of Billings Police Department on his law firm’s letterhead, requesting Anderson Towing be removed permanently from the Billings Police Department’s towing rotation list. In the letter, he referenced conversations he had with Assistant Police Chief Shawn Mayo, and also his status as a “22-year state judge.”
On Feb. 14, the general manager of Anderson Towing reviewed the bill and agreed to refund $500 as a traffic control fee that was not necessary during the work on the accident. However, when he offered to refund the money, Fagg refused.
On Feb. 25, St. John notified Anderson Towing it had been permanently removed from the towing rotation, due in part to the complaints.
The lawsuit said that the chief of police has violated the company’s due process rights and state law, and seeks compensatory damages, reinstatement, attorney’s fees and possible punitive fees for depriving the company of its constitutional rights.
  Bad blood in the world of towing 

According to state law and the lawsuit filed on Thursday in federal court in Billings, the state mandates qualified towing companies formally ask (in writing) to be placed on a city, county or state towing list and must be placed on an equitable rotation. Those companies are overseen by a state board, the Tow Truck Complaint Resolution Committee.
In November, Anderson Towing was the subject of a complaint involving work the company had done in Gallatin County. In that decision heard by the resolution committee, it gave the state, county or local companies permission to suspend Anderson Towing for as long as six months due to the committee’s decision that it had engaged in price gouging. Anderson Towing says in the lawsuit and told the committee it disputes that finding . The lawsuit claims the committee sanctioned Anderson Towing, in part because Joanne Blyton, the manager and owner of Billings Towing and Recovery, was a competitor of Anderson and a comparable towing bill from her company was higher than the bill at issue for Anderson.
Nonetheless, a decision or sanction from the committee allows cities, counties and the state to sanction the company, although it doesn’t mandate any entity to necessarily enforce the sanction. It is a discretionary punishment. Still, the City of Billings Police Department suspended the towing company from its rotation from Nov. 1 through Nov. 14 for the sanction, but then reinstated the company.
  Permanently suspended 

In a four-page letter to Anderson Towing after the incident with Fagg, St. John said the company would be permanently removed from the list and city officials were not going to reconsider the decision. However, the company said it was already sanctioned for the previous incident, and was back to working for the city.
St. John told the Daily Montanan on Friday he had not seen the court filing, but that Anderson Towing was removed because of both formal and informal complaints.
“In general Anderson Towing was removed from the BPD wrecker rotation list for similar complaints referenced by the MHP,” St. John said via email.
The letter from St. John, sent certified mail to Anderson Towing and submitted as an exhibit to the federal court, said the city had completed an investigation of the company on its own.
“The City of Billings cannot allow Anderson Towing to unnecessarily and unreasonably charge Billings citizens for tow services,” the letter said.
Using the decision by the towing committee and the complaint by Fagg, St. John said the City of Billings sought the input of “two other tow truck operators” to come to its conclusions.
“This decision is permanent and will not be reconsidered,” St. John said, claiming the company had engaged in “willful and consistent failure by Anderson Towing to treat Billings citizens in a fair and equitable manner consistent with recognized tow truck standards.”
The lawsuit claims a city cannot decide to remove the company and sanction it without due process and without going through the state committee, set up to work through complaints and avoid favoritism.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin will lose more than $210 million in federal funds that were to be used for mental health, substance abuse prevention and bolstering emergency medical services, state officials said Friday.
The money involved is Wisconsin’s share of $12 billion to combat infectious disease and other serious health problems that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has summarily cut off, NBC News and the New York Times reported this week.
In Wisconsin, the funds were to be used for suicide prevention; substance abuse prevention; public health departments, programs and laboratories, including EMS services; and the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, the office of Gov. Tony Evers said Friday.
The governor’s office discussed the health funds cutback along with  other programs targeted for reductions or considered vulnerable under the Trump administration, including education funding, farm programs and in the Department of Veterans Affairs. On Thursday, the Trump administration announced it will cut 10,000 employees from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“Reckless cuts by President Trump and Elon Musk to help pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires are causing devastating consequences for Wisconsin’s kids, families, and communities and services they depend on every day,” Evers said in a statement released Friday.
“With threats to Medicaid and Medicare, cuts to researching cures for Alzheimer’s disease and cancer, efforts to undermine food and drug safety, and continued attacks on the Affordable Care Act, the Trump Administration is jeopardizing health and access to health care in Wisconsin and across our country,” Evers said.
State Rep. Greta Neubauer (D-Racine), the Assembly minority leader, said Friday that the cuts “will be devastating for Wisconsinites who rely on these essential programs.”
“President Trump and Elon Musk are selling out Wisconsin families and communities, threatening our health and safety just to pay for unnecessary tax cuts for their billionaire friends,” said state Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison), the ranking Democrat on the Assembly Health, Aging and Long-Term Care Committee and chair of the Assembly’s Democratic caucus.
“This reckless move by the Trump Administration, coupled with cuts to vital medical research and threats to the future of Medicaid and Medicare, will have a devastating impact on the health of our state,” Subeck said.
Evers said his administration will explore “every legal option available to us” to fight the cuts.
The $12 billion that HHS cut this week was authorized by Congress through COVID-19 relief bills enacted in the first two years of the pandemic. The funds were later allowed for public health needs outside the pandemic, the New York Times reported this week.
The World Health Organization reports that “COVID-19 continues to circulate widely . . . presenting significant challenges to health systems worldwide. Tens of thousands of people are infected or re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 each week.”
The UN-affiliated public health agency emphasizes continued surveillance of the viral pandemic. “It is vital that countries sustain the public health response to COVID-19 amid ongoing illness and death and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, adapting it to the requirements based on the current COVID-19 situation and risk,” WHO says.

No structures have been damaged, and no injuries or deaths have been reported, officials said during a Friday media briefing, one week after the first of the two fires started.
Together, the fires in Greenville and Pickens counties had burned more than 10,600 total acres as of Friday morning, officials said. Both fires, which officials said were manmade, remained 0% contained. A statewide burn ban remains in effect.
Four teenage hikers have been questioned by police about the Table Rock fire, and “charges are pending,” according to the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office.

The fires prompted mandatory evacuations for people nearest the flames. About 1,400 homes were evacuated as of Thursday morning, according to Greenville County Emergency Management. A shelter set up at Marietta First Baptist Church had about 20 people staying there Friday morning, said Kim Stenson, director of the state Emergency Management Division.
The fire is the largest mountain wildfire in state history, surpassing a 2016 fire in the same area that burned 10,000 acres.
“We’ve never had a fire quite like this,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.
Downed trees and other debris knocked loose when Hurricane Helene hit the state as a tropical storm in September are complicating matters, said Scott Phillips, head of the state Forestry Commission. Firefighters are struggling to get equipment onto paths blocked by the storm. Some trees fell across established fire breaks, meaning crews have to saw through logs to keep the fire from spreading even further.
Dried-out timber also created more fuel for the fire. While that hasn’t been the primary concern yet, it could become a much bigger issue of the flames reach areas where timber cleared from roads still sits in stacks, Phillips said.

The debris “is going to change the way we have to attack fires in the mountains of South Carolina and in the Hurricane Helene-impacted areas,” Phillips said.
High winds combined with recent dry conditions have made the fires particularly difficult to contain. Crews have been working to create perimeters cleared of debris that the fire can’t cross, but the wind has carried embers from the Table Rock over barriers as wide as 40 feet, Phillips said.
“With these fires and the conditions we’re facing in the state right now, the dryness of the fuel, the extreme low humidities, the high winds that we’re having, containment is very, very difficult to achieve,” Phillips said.
Embers ignited parts of Table Rock State Park earlier this week, Phillips said. Table Rock, Caesars Head and Jones Gap state parks remained closed Friday, according to the state parks department.
State Law Enforcement Division and National Guard teams had dropped more than 700,000 gallons of water on the fire by Friday, agency directors said. Air tankers dropped thousands of gallons of fire retardant along the northern edge of the fires Thursday, according to the Forestry Commission. Among them was a very large air tanker, which the commission used for the first time in the state.
SLED has also been helping police monitor evacuated neighborhoods to prevent looting and keep roads clear of spectators who have been congregating, said SLED Chief Mark Keel.
Much of the firefighters’ focus has been on protecting nearby structures, officials said. One way of doing that is through burnout operations, in which crews intentionally light fires they can closely monitor to reduce the fuel leading up to buildings, slowing the uncontrolled wildfire.
The fires are visible from miles around, said House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, who lives about 7 miles from the blaze in Pickens. His home isn’t within the current evacuation zone, but he can see the glow of the fire on the side of the mountain from his front porch, he said.
Upstate SC wildfires burn upwards of 2,000 acres

“There’s smoke everywhere,” Hiott said.
The high winds died down slightly Friday, helping matters somewhat, officials said. The National Weather Service is predicting rain Sunday and Monday, which could help firefighters control the blaze.
“Pray for the men and women out here, and pray for rain,” Hiott said.
A fire near Myrtle Beach that ignited last month continues to burn. At about 2,000 acres, that fire is about 85% contained and has damaged no structures or killed any people, Phillips said.
This month, the Forestry Commission has responded to more than 370 fires that burned more than 18,000 acres total, Phillips said. That’s “orders of magnitude” more than the commission usually sees in a month, and more than it has seen in some years, he said.
April is typically the busiest month for forest fires, Phillips said.
“This is going to be a long season for us as we move forward,” he said.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Minneapolis on Thursday has become the fourth U.S. city to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing software, joining San Francisco, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, in a growing wave of legislation aimed to protect renters from rental price-gouging.
While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.
The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote. Colorado’s House approved a similar bill this week, and it’s now headed to the Senate.
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)House Bill 118, a proposal to solidify the Alaska Governor’s Council on Human and Sex Trafficking into a permanent fixture of the state government, is a deeply concerning one, fraught with potential for continuing abuse and a demonstrated lack of necessity and accountability. 
A close examination of the council’s track record, its potential for misuse, and the actual landscape of human and sex trafficking cases in Alaska, as revealed by recent data, paints a clear picture: A council is not the solution Alaska needs and should not be granted permanent status.
One of the most damning indictments against the council is its blatant lack of transparency. Community United for Safety and Protection, or CUSP, an advocacy group for survivors, has repeatedly encountered significant challenges in accessing public meetings and obtaining meeting minutes. 
In testimony to the Alaska House Judiciary Committee, CUSP members, including myself, outlined obstacles to participating in council meetings. In 2022, we were unable to join an online meeting, not informed about another, and denied access to requested public records. In 2023, we waited 30 minutes to be admitted to a meeting but were never let in, and another meeting was rescheduled at the last minute, limiting public participation. One CUSP member was only admitted after using a variation of their first name.
This conduct is in direct violation of Alaska’s Open Meetings Act. 
A state council dedicated to such a critical issue should hear from those with lived experience and expertise.
There is reason for concern that the council could create conflicts of interest for its members, who are handpicked by the state’s governor. While direct financial compensation for council members is barred under the bill, the individuals who have been appointed so far have had affiliations with organizations and projects that stand to receive state funding or grants. 
This creates an inherent conflict of interest, as the council’s decisions could be influenced by the potential for financial gain for its past members’ associated entities rather than the best interests of trafficking survivors. 
This potential for self-serving practices, shielded by a lack of transparency, is a significant reason to oppose the council’s permanent establishment.
Examining the actual prevalence of sex trafficking in Alaska, as documented in a CUSP report, “Prostitution and Sex Trafficking Charges in Alaska, 2020-2024,” further weakens the argument for the necessity of this council. 
The report reveals a startlingly low number of actual sex trafficking charges of adults at the state and federal levels, with only three state cases identified over the nearly five years of the research period and no federal charges. 
The data suggests that the legal framework is often applied in ways that do not align with the common understanding of forced labor and exploitation in the sex industry. 
Many federal cases labeled as sex trafficking of minors were essentially child molestation cases where payment was involved. An antitrafficking review report highlights that antiprostitution and sex trafficking laws, as they stand and are enforced, often fail to address the root causes of exploitation and can even harm marginalized individuals.
Given the council’s consistent lack of transparency, the potential for conflicts of interest, and the questionable application of sex trafficking laws in Alaska, the argument for making the council a permanent entity crumbles. 
Alaska’s ability to combat sex trafficking has remained unchanged despite the council’s inactivity for over eight months, further proving its irrelevance. Organizations like CUSP, composed of sex workers and sex trafficking survivors, are actively engaged in providing feedback and advocating for effective policies based on their lived experiences. Their exclusion from the council’s processes highlights a fundamental flaw in its structure and purpose.
Instead of solidifying a non-transparent and potentially self-serving body, the Alaska Legislature should prioritize evidence-based solutions and accountability. 
There is a need to reevaluate how sex trafficking laws are applied, focusing on genuine cases of force, fraud, and coercion, and separating child sexual abuse from prostitution statutes. 
Empowering and listening to the voices of those directly affected by the criminalization of prostitution and sex trafficking, rather than relying on an insular council, is crucial for developing effective strategies to address these complex issues in Alaska. 
Rather than institutionalize a council that lacks transparency and has demonstrated a failure to meaningfully address trafficking, the state could direct resources toward survivor-led initiatives, evidence-based harm reduction strategies, and comprehensive social services that address the root causes of exploitation. The passage of HB118 would only perpetuate ineffective policies while causing additional harm to the communities it claims to protect.

Hundreds of Catholics conducted a counter-protest in opposition of Satanic Grotto’s presence in Topeka. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The bullhorn-powered war of words between satanists and Catholics boiled over into brawling and a handful of arrests Friday during an extraordinary event at the Kansas Capitol that pushed boundaries of free speech and the separation of church and state.
After about two hours of speeches, prayers and sign waving among hundreds of people mostly segregated by barricades staffed by law enforcement officers, Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart, with supporters and reporters in tow, entering the Statehouse to conduct what he had described as a black mass. He was warned at the door to the visitors’ center that any formal protest inside the building that violated a permit limiting his religious expression to the lawn or steps of the Capitol would result in his arrest for trespassing.
In the rotunda, Stewart began the rebellious form of a mass and was interrupted by three people intent on stopping was could be interpreted as a mockery of their faith. An unidentified man and woman, with young kids at their side, physically intervened to stop Stewart. He turned away from them. Counter-protester Marcus Schroeder joined the fray and twice reached to take papers from Stewart’s hand. Stewart responded by punching Schroeder in the face twice. More than half a dozen Capitol Police wrestled Stewart to the floor to make the arrest.
“I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting,” Stewart repeatedly yelled.
Schroeder, who wore a shirt declaring “Death is not welcome here,” wasn’t arrested by Capitol Police. In an interview, he defended his maneuvering to thwart Stewart.
“I tried to take his papers. He punched me in the face,” he said.
After the area cleared, two other satanists tried to pick up where Stewart left off and were taken into custody. One other person was cuffed and taken away by law enforcement outside the Capitol on Friday. An individual grabbed Stewart by the legs in a bid to stop Stewart from stomping on crackers intended to represent those used in a Catholic mass to represent the consecrated body and soul of Christ. In that brief exchange, Stewart also punched the guy before law enforcement stepped in.
  Hundreds of Christians upset with an organization’s plan to conduct a satanic black mass at the Capitol delivered a robust counter-protest to emphasize their disdain for followers of Satanic Grotto. Both sides of the debate used bullhorns to punctuate their messages, creating a blended sound that was difficult for anybody to hear clearly. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
“He was was trying to tackle me to get to the cracker underneath,” Stewart said. “I was able to kind of fend him off. I do think he may have picked up the crumbled cracker and ate it. Did I get physical with him? Yes.”
  The opposition 

The colorful display of affection and affliction for organized religion culminated attempts by Gov. Laura Kelly, Attorney General Kris Kobach, leaders of the Kansas Legislature and Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, to derail the demonstration planned by Satanic Grotto.
Kelly had the group’s permit amended so no protest could transpire inside the Capitol. Legislative leaders modified policy regarding use of the Capitol to specifically target Satanic Grotto. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, said the First Amendment didn’t protect offensive speech or violations of law.
Francis Slobodnik, a Topeka representative of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, told hundreds of Catholics gathered on the south side of the Capitol that state public officials shouldn’t have allowed satanists to assemble on public property. He said the event reflected a misguided understanding of freedom of speech and religion and a lack of appreciation for how a black mass represented worship of Satan.
“Today’s horrific event, the first of its kind in the history of Kansas, is a sacrilege,” Slobodnik said. “Of course, there have been terrible crimes and injustices that have happened in our state over the years. However, nothing in our past compares with what is happening today where God is being directly challenged on the state Capitol grounds. The state Capitol represents all of us.”
He praised the people present at the rally to stand in opposition to Satanic Grotto, referring to them as the Navy Seals of the Catholic faith. He said these activists were willing to confront God’s enemies head-on as if on a field of battle. He said the great sin perpetrated by Stewart and other worshipers of Satan meant that others had to step into the void.
“Satanists do not realize that Satan hates all of God’s creation, including them,” Slobodnik said. “Their reward for worshiping and serving him will be eternal fire.”
  And, an exorcist 

Former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who served in the Kansas Senate before elected to Congress, said he consulted with a priest with experience in exorcism to figure whether he should participate in a television interview with Stewart.
“Father had a simple question: ‘Why would you do this? What do you hope to gain?’ I stumbled around in my answer,” Huelskamp said. “I wanted to share the truth about Christ. The truth about the Eucharist. His summary response was quite stunning to me. He said, ‘There is no good that could come from being in the same room with a Satanist.’”
Huelskamp said it was suggested his participation in the interview with Stewart might serve interests of Satan. The former Republican congressman woke ill the next day, and cancelled the interview. In the end, Huelskamp said he decided it was important to run to the fire created by Satan rather than shrink from it. He said it was the same as making his views known about the evil of abortion and defending the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman.
“I am quite stubborn and hardheaded,” he said. “We cannot be silent. We are required, if we call ourselves Christians, if we call ourselves Catholic, we are publicly required to defend the faith and to stand up for the truth.”
In an interview amid calm before the storm of his arrest, Stewart said he was convinced Catholics assembled around him didn’t understand why Satanic Grotto was at the Capitol to talk about religious oppression.
“What we only want is the rights that every American has,” Stewart said. “I’ve heard people say we’re setting a precedent. Well, if the precedent is freedom of religion for everyone in public spaces, yes, that’s what we’re trying to establish. We are dragging this issue out in the light and we’ll let the people look at it. The issue is that we’re not all being treated the same here.”

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill advancing in the Senate would make it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia except for the narrow circumstances when the procedure is legal in the state.  
The Senate Judiciary Committee referred Senate Bill 85 to the full Senate on Thursday. Senators are expected to vote on the bill next week. 
With few exceptions, abortion has been illegal in West Virginia since 2022. Abortion by telehealth is also illegal in the state. 
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, one of the bill’s sponsors, said the intent of Senate Bill 85 is to stop the flow of abortifacients into the state for the purpose of illegal abortions. The bill attempts to enforce the state’s abortion ban on out-of-state entities or physicians who would send the medication to West Virginia residents.
The penalty for violating the law would be three to 10 years in prison for a person who is not a licensed medical professional. Licensed medical professionals would face the revocation of their license, according to the bill. 
While the legislation is an attempt to stop out-of-state providers from breaking West Virginia law, federal courts are likely to decide the issue of enforcement, an attorney for the judiciary committee said.  
Louisiana last month charged a New York doctor with a felony for allegedly sending abortion pills to a pregnant minor in the state, according to reporting by the Associated Press.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused to extradite the doctor to face the charges. New York has a shield law to protect abortion providers who prescribe the medication to patients in states where abortion is outlawed. 
Kelly Lemon, a nurse midwife, testified that some medications labeled as abortifacients have a lot of other uses in health care. Lemon said the state’s existing abortion laws have already led to some of her patients not being able to get misoprostol for managing a hemorrhage and delays in care for treating a miscarriage. 
“My biggest concern with this bill is that it’s going to further create barriers to how we can get these medications to people when they need it,” she said. The bill, should it become law, would cause delays in care and drive health providers out of the state, she said.
Rucker responded that the bill indicates that pharmacists filling a valid prescription issued by a licensed medical professional or a physician performing a procedure for a legitimate reason are not breaking the law. 
Kristin Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, testified that the bill would close a lot of loopholes for charging physicians and entities that send abortion medication to states where the procedure is not legal. Hawkins said there are websites where people can get abortion pills sent to them, seemingly without a doctor’s review.
Emily Womeldorff, director of policy and campaigns for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said the bill is part of an ongoing effort to create fear and stigma around reproductive health care.
“This bill is a gross overreach of state authority,” Womeldorff said. “It’s threatening enforcement against health care providers that are located outside of the borders of West Virginia, and our government does not have jurisdiction over health care providers that provide care outside of our state borders.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, was the only lawmaker to speak against the bill, calling it bad policy that would harm a woman’s ability to get medical care.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)It’s a lot of money — $7.3 billion.
Those are the federal dollars accounted for in the main budget bill for the state of Montana, nearly half of the $16.4 billion total for the next biennium.
Now, some of those dollars might be at risk, or at least subject to stricter scrutiny.
President Donald Trump, newly sworn into a second term, has embarked on an aggressive plan to cut federal spending with help from billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.
Montanans have already seen some results — both praised and criticized.
Supporters see red tape slashed and less bureaucracy ahead, but others see dollars for food banks disappearing, U.S. Forest Service workers laid off, and closed bathrooms on federal lands.
In the meantime, the 2025 Montana Legislature is in session, and lawmakers are combing through billions of dollars in House Bill 2, the big budget bill, along with statutory appropriations.
So what happens to the state budget if federal dollars to Montana start drying up?
“I don’t want to speak too soon, but I definitely think that we might have to come back for a special session, because you can’t craft a budget when a large percentage of it is dependent on those federal dollars,” said Rep. Donovan Hawk, D-Butte, at a recent press availability.
He and other Democrats said they’d like to have more open discussions to plan ahead for federal cuts and even a possible downturn in the economy.
  Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad. (Provided by the Montana Legislature)
In the meantime, Republican Chairman of House Appropriations Llew Jones said he’d like to squirrel away reserves — a strategy he said can be controversial because some people would rather spend the dollars on social services.
Jones, of Conrad, also said he’s planning to put “triggers” in legislation to bring the Legislative Finance Committee back to Helena for closer budget scrutiny if changes in Washington, D.C., meet certain thresholds and become more than just “noise.”
“I would like to not run red ink,” Jones said.
Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office did not respond to an email about how the cuts at the federal level might affect the way the governor is thinking about the budget.
However, Jones said the separate finance teams for the governor and the legislature have a good working relationship — not always in agreement, but not adversarial — and will communicate about any hardships.
He said it may be that the budget for the current biennium ends up skirting any emergency, and the 2027 legislature ends up dealing with a drop in federal dollars.
So a special session isn’t a given, although legislators such as Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, have sounded warning bells about the possibility, specifically related to Medicaid expansion.
Federal money currently pays for 90% of Medicaid expansion, a program set to continue in Montana with a bill signed this week by Gianforte.
“We’re going to be back here, and I’m going to tell you, ‘I told you so,’” said Glimm during an earlier debate.
‘Sugar high’ won’t last forever
Federal dollars account for different portions of the budget for different agencies.
They’re a big chunk of the budget of the Department of Public Health and Human Services’ budget — an estimated $4.7 billion out of $7 billion for the biennium as proposed in the governor’s budget.
That’s an estimated 67%.
At a recent press availability, Rep. Mary Caferro, D-Helena, said one concern she has is that the rules for balancing the budget don’t include doing so without cutting things like health services.

Caferro said the state has plenty of money, and in the meantime, the Trump administration has been unpredictable, and she’d like to see preparations.
Federal dollars from the Covid-19 pandemic buoyed the state budget, but only temporarily.
“This sugar high, as they call it when they talk about human services stuff, is not going to last forever,” Caferro said.
She said a bill she’s sponsoring calls for a Medicaid stabilization fund and would help on one front.
House Bill 880, scheduled to be heard Monday in House Appropriations, would capture any excess money from the state for Medicaid that the health department didn’t use, Caferro said.
Usually, she said, that unused money goes back to the general fund, but HB 880 would set it aside and allow the governor to tap it to avoid cuts if needed.
Jones said protecting the health department is one reason he would like to ensure the state has adequate reserves, and in multiple places.
He said lots of money goes to education, but the state can’t cut a teacher’s salary halfway through the year, and some constitutional protections apply.
“(But) nothing says that you can’t cut provider rates. That just sucks to be you,” Jones said of the situation he wants the state to avoid.
The most recent special session took place in 2017, and the Montana Budget and Policy Center said the health department experienced some of the deepest cuts.
“The loser, when you run in red ink, is DPHHS,” Jones said. “It will be again if there’s not reserves.”
‘Scary’ worst-case-scenario
Federal dollars are a smaller part of other agencies’ budgets. For example, they’re just 5% for the Montana University System, albeit still $37 million.
“The Federal Special Revenue funds authorized in HB 2 cover programs like GEAR UP, Perkins and TRiO programs,” said Galen Hollenbaugh, spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, in an email.
GEAR UP stands for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs.

According to the Montana University System, the grant serves students in 7th through 12th grades to improve high school graduation and college enrollment rates, and it will have served 8,800 students altogether, including 5,800 Native American students, in its duration.
Perkins supports career and technical education, and TriO helps first generation, low-income or disabled students.
At the Department of Environmental Quality, federal dollars make up an estimated 37%, or $52.9 million of $143.9 million, based on the governor’s proposed budget for the biennium.
As proposed, federal funds account for 9% of the Department of Justice budget, $31 million out of $338 million for the same period.
At the Office of Public Instruction, federal money for the biennium is $368.7 million, or about 13.6%.
At a recent press availability, Rep. Eric Matthews, D-Bozeman, said legislators received assurances from OPI that funding streams for education remain intact in Montana for the moment, but he said uncertainty exists.
Even though the money from the federal government isn’t “a hugely significant portion” of the overall education budget, Matthews, who is a teacher, said schools already are behind due to inflation, and they’re already having a hard time hiring teachers and support staff.
He said cuts could make it more difficult to keep up with inflation and hire educators. Federal dollars fund special education, and he said it would be hard to provide services to students with IEPs, or Individualized Education Plans.
“It would just open up all sorts of potential for lawsuits from parents,” Matthews said. “The worst-case-scenario is pretty scary.”
Earlier this month, Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen said the Trump administration has assured her the money that’s supposed to flow to Montana will continue to be sent to the state.
Big budget, big reserve
Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said the budget started with a $552 million cushion.
But the governor proposed a “very healthy” budget, he said. If legislators approve a big tax cut and “seismic shifts” take place at the federal level, he could see the need to hit the “reset button” in a special session.
“In the big picture, change flips pretty darn quick,” Regier said at a press availability this week.
The triggers that Jones is working on would call for additional Legislative Fiscal Committee meetings if Congress passes a law or the president signs an executive order that means income from the feds hits a certain problematic threshold or the general fund runs into trouble.
That way, he said, lawmakers can figure out if they can work through it in the moment, if they need to have a special session, or if they can hold off until the next regular session, starting in January 2027.
To try to keep the budget steady, Jones also said he’s a “reserve freak,” although he said some legislators in his party disagree with his approach and would rather see spending decrease if federal money dries up.
He said a sizable portion of state income is volatile, 70% from income tax, so to him, that means setting more aside.
“The more variable you make it, the more reserves I want, because the more it gets reactive to recession,” Jones said.
To prepare, he said he requests support from the Legislative Fiscal Division: “I want you to model the amount of money we need to keep on hand to survive a 20-year recession without slashing and burning everything.”
Jones said it means roughly three to six months of income, similar to what a financial manager will tell a household. For the state, though, it’s $1.2 billion, and he said some criticism comes with that high amount.
“They say, ‘Geez, you’re keeping $1.2 billion in reserve. How dare you?’ Well, we’re a big budget,” Jones said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos04-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 16:03:23.156185

Doroudi, an Iranian national pursuing a PhD in mechanical engineering, was taken into custody by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit on Tuesday around 3 a.m., Rozas said in a statement sent on Friday. Immigration authorities cited the U.S. State Department’s revocation of Doroudi’s student visa as the reason for his arrest.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Doroudi “posed significant national security concerns.” The spokesperson declined to provide further details about what the concerns were, saying “That is all we are able to share at this time.”
Rozas challenged that characterization, saying he was unaware “of any allegations concerning significant national security issues.”
“He has not been arrested for any crime, nor has he participated in any anti-government protests,” the statement from Rozas said. “He is legally present in the U.S., pursuing his American dream by working towards his doctorate in mechanical engineering.”
Rozas added that Doroudi’s student visa was still active and that he was in the early stages of applying for permanent residency as a researcher.
Student organizers from the Students for Justice in Palestine, a student organization at UA, said Thursday that Doroudi had no involvement in recent pro-Palestine protests at the university or with the organization.
Doroudi’s fiancé, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani, started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal expenses, garnering over $21,000 in about a day. She said in a LinkedIn post that Doroudi’s is set to defend his dissertation next academic year and has been “fully engaged” in academic work and research projects in the department.
“His dedication and achievements have earned him recognition in his field and led to his selection to apply for permanent residency,” she wrote in a post.
The University of Alabama has not provided further details about the situation. Spokesperson Alex House did not respond to messages Friday after initially stating that the university was cooperating with immigration authorities. House did not address whether the university was offering Doroudi any assistance.

(Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Friday signed into law a massive higher education overhaul to ban diversity efforts, regulate classroom discussion, and prohibit faculty strikes, among other things. The law will take effect in 90 days. 
 S.B. 1 will set rules around classroom discussion, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things. 
For classroom discussion, the bill will set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. S.B. 1 would only affect Ohio’s public universities.
The bill moved quickly through the Statehouse. State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced S.B. 1, which passed the Ohio Senate in February and the Ohio House in March. Cirino introduced a nearly identical bill during the last General Assembly that went through several revisions, but the bill never made it the House floor and ultimately died. 
The bill received overwhelming opposition from college students and professors. More than 1,500 people have submitted opponent testimony against the bill. Hundreds of students around the state have protested against the bill. Students and faculty have said they would leave Ohio if the bill becomes law.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Another nail was hammered into the coffin of Certificate of Need repeal on Friday, as the West Virginia House of Delegates overwhelmingly voted down — after a drawn out “fiasco” over rules and procedure — a motion to discharge House Bill 2007.
With 10 members absent and not voting, lawmakers in the body voted 72-15 against discharging the bill.
The discharge motion, if successful, would have brought the original version of HB 2007 — a bill to totally repeal the Certificate of Need process in the state — to the House floor, where the full body would have considered it for the first time. 
The bill died last month in the House Committee on Health and Human Resources when lawmakers voted 13-12 against it.
Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, made the motion to discharge the bill from committee and to the floor, saying members should support his motion because HB 2007 “will end the government created monopoly on health care.”
In response to Anders, Del. Carl Martin, R-Upshur, immediately made a motion to table his discharge motion. 
But Martin’s motion, said Del. Matthew Rohrbach, R-Cabell, who was acting as speaker, was out of order and not allowed based on rules of the chamber. This is despite a motion to table a discharge motion previously being successful earlier this session. That previous motion and vote, Rohrbach said, should have been out of order as well.
Del. Brandon Steele, R-Raleigh, called for a motion to overturn Rohrbach’s ruling, which was supported by House counsel as well as the House parliamentarian and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who was not present Friday.
“What are we even doing here?!” Steele exclaimed, before his motion failed 58-31. 
With that failed vote, and after several back-and-forths regarding the technicalities of the House Rules as well as Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure — the rulebook that dictates House actions this year alongside the chamber’s own rules — Rohrbach’s ruling that Martin’s motion to table the discharge motion was out of order stood as the rule of the chamber. 
The body then voted down Anders’ original discharge motion, laying HB 2007 to rest yet again.
Repealing Certificate of Need in West Virginia was one of only two health care policies that Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced as priorities for his first legislative session this year. The other policy — adding religious and philosophical exemptions to the state’s vaccine mandates — failed on the House floor earlier this week. 
During his State of the State, Morrisey called the Certificate of Need process “big government activism at its worst” and promised that by repealing it, the state would “move toward the free market.” 
Bills to repeal CON have been introduced in the Legislature annually since at least 2017. This year marked the second time ever that the bill made it to a committee, as well as the second time it was voted down by that committee.
CON is a regulatory process, overseen by the West Virginia Health Care Authority, that requires entities looking to create or expand health care services in the state to receive a legal document proving those new services fit an unmet need in the area. 
Through the Health Care Authority, those interested in obtaining a Certificate of Need receive technical assistance before applying to see what need they are meeting. Services are approved through a needs methodology and different services — such as hospice care, ambulatory centers, clinics, private practices and specialty services — have different methodologies.
Proponents for the repeal believe that doing away with the laws will allow more competition in health care across West Virginia. Those against repeal worry that doing away with the process will hurt West Virginia’s more rural and vulnerable populations, where a lack of regulation could threaten what services are offered to the 75% of residents who are government payers, meaning their health insurance comes from Medicare, Medicaid or the Public Employees Insurance Agency.
While the House’s version of the bill to repeal Certificate of Need seems relatively dead — all bills must be at least on first reading on the floor in their chambers of origin by Sunday — another bill has been introduced in the Senate that would do the same. Lawmakers there, however, have yet to touch it and seem unlikely to do so.
In past years, there have been Hail Mary attempts to amend a total repeal of certificate of need into other bills that deal with the same section of code. It’s possible the same could happen this year, as several bills that touch on Certificate of Need are still circulating as crossover day approaches next week.

,Source New Mexico,2025-03-28 19:45:43+00:00,Source New Mexico,NM Health officials say federal cuts won’t impact measles efforts,Danielle Prokop,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/03/28/nm-health-officials-say-federal-cuts-wont-impact-measles-efforts/,New Mexico health officials say billions in federal grant cancellations won't impact the state's efforts to combat measles,"(Conceptual image/Getty Photos)Billions in recently eliminated federal grants to state health agencies won’t impact New Mexico’s efforts to combat the measles outbreak, according to Health Department Communications Director Robert Nott.
Nott told Source on Friday the agency had identified $60 million in lost grants, and was still evaluating the impact on its programs. But “none of it is touching measles,” he said, noting that the state would use federal and state funds to “keep all positions. We did lose 37 temporary contract staff,” he noted, “but nothing is going to touch the measles battle.”
As of Friday, the state had a total of 44 cases, with one new report since Tuesday in Lea County, which now reports 42 cases. Eddy County has the remaining two cases.
While only two new cases were reported in total this week, Nott cautioned against complacency about the outbreak.
“We don’t want to be at all overconfident about this,” he said. “We want people to be aware, we want them to seek out MMR vaccines if they want them. This could be a lull, but this is an incredibly contagious disease and we are not taking for granted that it’s over or close to over.”
Of New Mexico’s cases, 23 afflicted people over the age of 18; 13 were among the ages of 5 and 17; and eight cases included children 4 years old and younger. 
The quirk of New Mexico’s nearly even split between children and adults with measles infections is due in part to the small number of reports, New Mexico Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source, particularly compared to Texas.
Texas health officials on Friday reported 400 cases since the outbreak began in late January: a 22% increase since Tuesday. 
Health officials have found identical strains in measles cases in both Kansas and New Mexico that match genetic samples from Texas, the World Health Organization reported on Thursday.
While the genetic data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remains preliminary, Smelser said, it shows a link to the outbreak which started in neighboring Gaines County, Texas. 
“We are comfortable linking the measles cases in Texas as having the same virus we see circulating in New Mexico,” he told Source.
The other reasons for the age spread here, Smelser said, may include factors like hesitancy to see a doctor and the challenge for NMDOH to count all the measles cases. 
“We don’t have lab testing on everybody and so sometimes that can make it a little difficult to count all the cases,” Smelser said. “Also, we know in this outbreak that we have folks who are hesitant to seek medical care and get tested, some of those are likely to be kids.” 
The agency has a team of nurses and epidemiologists trying to trace the spread of the virus by contacting patients currently with measles or suspected cases, and hospitals treating them.
“Working with us is the most helpful thing for us all to protect our communities and our loved ones, as well as being fully vaccinated,” Smelser said. “The Department of Health is ready to help people if they need to test as well as if they’re in need of getting caught up on their vaccinations.”
According to Nott, between Feb. 1 and March 25, more than 14,100 New Mexicans received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine across the state, more than double from last year, “so we remain really encouraged,” he said.
Vaccines remain available to walk-in patients at numerous public health patients, and at vaccination clinics scheduled throughout the state.
NMDOH directs any questions about measles tests, symptoms or vaccines to the Helpline at 1-833-796-8773. The helpline is staffed by nurses who can answer questions in English or Spanish.
Measles, an extremely contagious respiratory virus, spreads via contact with droplets in the air, which can linger for hours. People can spread the virus several days before symptoms including fever, spotty red rash, cough, runny nose or red eyes appear. About one in five cases is serious enough to warrant hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Complications from measles include brain swelling, blindness, pneumonia and death.
The deaths earlier this year of a 6-year old Texas child, and a Lea County adult, both unvaccinated, are the first measles deaths in the U.S. in 10 years. 
Vaccine records can be found at the Vax View website or by calling the NMDOH immunization program at 1-833-882-6454, available weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

(Getty Images)As president of Poder Latino, I have witnessed firsthand how the rising cost of prescription drugs intensifies the struggles faced by Spanish-speaking Latina women living in unhealthy domestic situations. Our mission is to break down barriers so these women can access critical resources, gain independence, and build better lives across Utah. However, ever-rising medication prices add another layer of hardship to those already contending with limited finances, housing instability, and the complexities of leaving abusive environments.


 Domestic violence resources

Help for people in abusive relationships is available in Utah:

Utah Domestic Violence Coalition: A confidential statewide, 24-hour domestic violence hotline can be reached at 1-800-897-LINK (5465)
YWCA Women in Jeopardy program: 801-537-8600
Utah child abuse and neglect hotline: 1-855-323-DCFS (3237)
National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233



Over the past decade, pharmaceutical companies have steadily increased prices on essential and life-saving medications — often without meaningful improvements in effectiveness or safety. These corporate decisions to raise costs well beyond inflation disproportionately affect low-income families and individuals who cannot endure unexpected expenses. For Spanish-speaking Latinas facing domestic violence, every dollar must be allocated carefully, whether it goes toward safe shelter, legal aid, or counseling services. When prescription drug prices surge, these women face an impossible dilemma: Do they choose to pay for necessary medications or use that money to escape an abusive situation?
In Utah, where the cost of living is already climbing with inflation and rising housing expenses, soaring drug prices can tip the balance between stability and crisis. This burden is even greater for those who speak English as a second language, as they navigate additional challenges — such as finding translation services and managing an unfamiliar health care system. When medication becomes unaffordable, women often find themselves vulnerable to chronic illnesses, untreated mental health issues, and preventable illnesses — problems that only worsen if they are also dealing with trauma and abuse at home.
Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies continue to thrive, reaping enormous profits by charging Americans far more than patients in other countries for the same medications. This price disparity disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities who lack economic leverage, further trapping them in cycles of poverty and jeopardizing their future stability. The injustice is stark: Big Pharma benefits while families are forced to make impossible sacrifices, leaving their most basic health needs unmet.
Utah’s congressional delegation — lead by Republican Sens. John Curtis and Mike Lee — have the power to make a profound difference by championing federal legislation that holds pharmaceutical manufacturers accountable for unchecked price hikes. Reforms could range from capping out-of-pocket costs and tying price increases to inflation, to demanding transparent pricing structures that force drugmakers to justify steep hikes. Another crucial aspect is ending the “revolving door” between the industry and the agencies meant to regulate it — a practice that has long prioritized profits over public health.
By reigning in prescription drug costs, we can create a stronger safety net for the women we serve — ensuring they have access to the medications they need while they navigate housing, job training, and legal challenges. Affordability is not just a matter of financial relief; it is a necessary component of basic human dignity and empowerment. When women have the resources, they need to maintain their health, they are in a better position to break free from abusive environments and rebuild their lives.
I urge our senators and representatives to keep the needs of our most vulnerable Utahns at the forefront of the legislative process. Lowering the cost of prescription drugs is an essential step toward ensuring that every woman — regardless of language barriers, income, or life circumstances — has an equitable opportunity at a safe, healthy, and fulfilling life. The well-being of our entire community depends on it.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-185279294-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-03-28 16:03:23.156185

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – For a second time, an effort by the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office to prosecute the former director of the state historical society has been rebuffed.
On Monday, the Nebraska Court of Appeals approved a request by attorneys for Trevor Jones dismiss a felony theft by deception charge that had been filed by the Attorney General’s office.
Summary dismissal

Court filings show the dismissal was approved without taking formal arguments from the AG’s office – a summary dismissal. The appeals court ruled that state prosecutors failed to follow proper procedure in appealing an earlier dismissal of the case by a Lancaster County District Court judge based on the state’s failure to afford Jones a speedy trial.
The case could be appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s Office, Suzanne Gage, said Friday that the office disagreed with the ruling and would file “an appropriate motion” laying out the arguments.
Jones’ lead attorney, Mallory Hughes of Omaha, said she had been “very confident” that the Court of Appeals would dismiss the case and said she would be just as confident if the state filed an appeal to the Supreme Court.
“We agree with the rules and case law relied upon by the Court of Appeals in reaching its dismissal decision, and we will be prepared to argue the same should this matter proceed to the Nebraska Supreme Court,” Hughes wrote in an email.
Jones, 52, had headed the agency he renamed “History Nebraska” for six years before abruptly resigning in 2022, just prior to the release of a critical state audit.
The audit accused Jones of misusing $270,000 in donations from the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation. Instead of using it to cover operational losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Jones deposited the funds in a rival private foundation he had set up after clashing with the older, more established Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation.

Jones, who was paid $164,800-a-year in his state job, was charged with a felony in July 2023, a theft charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
The case moved slowly through Lancaster County Court after Jones’ lawyers challenged the evidence. His case was eventually bound over to District Court. But Jones’ attorneys argued that the state failed to bring him to trial by September, when the speedy trial clock tolled.
District Judge Susan Strong agreed, dismissing the charge. The AG’s office then appealed.
The failed prosecution was mentioned on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature recently, with State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln – an attorney – charging that the AG’s office appeared too preoccupied with other matters, including investigating ballot measures seeking to legalize medical cannabis, to properly monitor the Jones case.
Conrad urged the Attorney General – with whom she has frequently differed – to get the office’s “priorities in order.”
“While our attorney general is waging war on the Legislature, on the people’s right to initiative, running around all over the country, bringing politically charged litigation to further a radical political agenda, right here at home his agency couldn’t even prosecute this case to protect public funds,” the senator said.
The AG’s office had no immediate comment on Conrad’s criticism.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Bruce Spencer, a lobbyist representing the State Bar of Montana, did not need to elaborate on his organization’s position on a bill before the House Judiciary Committee on Friday — he’s said it all before. 
“I’m trying to think of something new to say,” Spencer told the committee. “I’ve got to be honest, I don’t have much.”
Spencer was testifying for at least the seventh time against a bill that seeks to make Montana’s judiciary more aligned with partisan politics. Another bill in the same vein was introduced earlier this week. 
Friday’s hearing was on House Bill 838, introduced by Speaker of the House Rep. Brandon Ler, R-Savage. The legislation would allow candidates for the Montana Supreme Court to run under a party affiliation, or under a nonpartisan label. 
The bill would also create a new primary system for Supreme Court candidates, putting all candidates on a primary ballot regardless of which party primary a voter participates in. The top two candidates, regardless of party affiliation, would proceed to the general election. 
“It’s my personal opinion that (judges) have already chosen a party to run under,” Ler said. “We see that time and time again with the way that the Montana Supreme Court operates, whether it’s them meddling in our rules, them pre-determining the outcome on the bench of different legislation we have, or the decisions that they make, which seem to be completely against the will of the majority of Montana voters.”
The bill had no proponents, but drew a dozen opponents during the hearing. 
Many of the arguments put forth have been hashed out repeatedly in both the House and Senate so far this legislative session. 
Three other pieces of legislation have sought to specifically make judicial races partisan. House Bill 295 failed to clear a House vote before transmittal, as did HB 751, which would have required Supreme Court candidates to declare a party affiliation. 
Senate Bill 42, however, has had more momentum, sailing through the Senate — albeit on partisan lines. SB 42 requires judges at any level to attach a partisan affiliation to their candidacy. 
Those bills’ proponents called them “voter education” bills, seeking to add transparency to elections that are conducted with seemingly less knowledge of candidates than other partisan races. 
Ler said since he believes the judiciary is already partisan, voters should be made aware of that before they reach the bench. 
But opponents pushed back against that characterization, saying judges make rulings based on the Constitution and the law, and should not be beholden to a party platform. 
“Judges don’t make decisions on the basis of a constituency, and that’s what political parties are. They’re setting out values for a constituency,” said Al Smith with the Montana Trial Lawyers Association. “That’s not what judges do. They look at the Constitution, the law, the facts of the case. They should be free from political pressure.”
Speaking specifically to the characterization of partisan elections as voter education bills, Anne Sherwood, with Friends of the Third Branch, an educational organization focused on the state’s judiciary, said the claim voters can’t find information about candidates is disingenuous. 
“This bill is also not going to increase voter education. It strains credulity that in today’s digital age, somebody cannot find information on these candidates,” Sherwood said. “… We have the internet. Now we have Twitter. Now we have Facebook. Now we have independent campaign spending.”
Spencer added the State Bar holds forums for Supreme Court candidates every election cycle — another way voters could learn about the candidates. 
The House Judiciary Committee passed HB 838 out of committee on a 12-8 party-line vote. 
Two additional bills related to a partisan judiciary met opposing fates in the Legislature. House Bill 39, which allows political parties to spend money on judicial races, was signed by the governor earlier this month, while House BIll 169, which would have let judges and judicial candidates take part in partisan activities, died in the Senate.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-03-28 16:03:23.156185

The university’s renovated and expanded applied engineering building, which opened Friday with a ribbon cutting ceremony, will offer cutting-edge lab and learning spaces and hands-on learning opportunities, Nook said. He said it will help students be prepared to fill critical roles in the state and country’s workforce.
“We didn’t build a building to have a pretty building,” Nook said. “We built a building to be able to help these young people, through the faculty and staff that you see up here, reach their educational goals, start them on their ways to meeting their professional goals, and help them understand how to build lives of purpose in their personal lives.”

The building renovation project, which came with a $44.7 million price tag, began just over a decade ago, Nook said, when UNI Facilities Management identified the need to renovate the building, which is now almost 50 years old. State appropriations totaling $40 million helped fund the facility, alongside $3 million in private donations.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a video played during the ceremony the renovations eliminated $10 million in deferred maintenance as well as providing necessary facilities for students to train for high-need jobs under the expertise and programming developed by the university and its industry partners.
With a job placement rate of 95% overall and 85% in Iowa, Reynolds said with the opening, UNI will be able to accommodate demand that has increased enrollment by 20%. It also will address changing needs from the engineering and construction industries, she said.
Reynolds said the new facility will create a “significant talent pipeline to these critical sectors,” and she can’t wait to see what the next 50 years has in store for UNI’s applied engineering programs.

“It goes to show what’s possible when the state and our outstanding regents universities work together on the most important issues facing Iowa,” Reynolds said.
Students gathered outside of the ceremony to protest Reynolds, holding signs supporting transgender people and calling for an end to attacks on education.
Originally 60,000 square feet, the renovations modernized the existing building and added 40,000 more square feet of new lab and collaborative spaces for programs in applied engineering, construction management and more, according to a news release.
Jim Kiesey, vice president of Estes Construction as well as a UNI alum and chair of the Construction Management Advisory Board, said during the ceremony the new facility “cements UNI’s legacy in applied engineering and construction management,” but goes beyond just the renovated building’s footprint on campus.
Through the legacy UNI is forging, Kiesey said the university is providing an education to future, competent leaders, helping them grow and learn how to advocate for themselves in their industry. The new spaces have also brought an energy fit to inspire the people in it.
“Prior to embarking on this rehabilitation, the 50-year old Applied Engineering Building received its AARP card in the mail, and through the efforts by many, this facility now has a youthful personality and energy that matches and serves the students that reside in this facility,” Kiesey said.
John Deere vice president and factory manager Fabio Castro said during the ceremony the long partnership between John Deere and UNI has “yielded a bountiful harvest,” with the corporation employing more than 1,200 UNI alumni and 90 part-time students. Deere also helps UNI through providing guidance on academic programs, Castro said, ensuring the curriculum will adequately prepare students for the field.
He said the company and university share many values, like integrity and commitment to excellence, and the pursuit of excellence both organizations push for is evident in the new facility.
“Not only does this physical building monumentalize that ambition, but the individuals whose educations, careers and lives will be impacted here carry on that legacy, that drive, that value of never settling,” Castro said. “I hope they will be inculcated with the burning passion to fight off complacency and move our world forward through the application of innovative solutions to our most complex problems. It is clear that our future workforce will need these critical skills to navigate the turbulent, unpredictable and somewhat novel challenges of our future.”

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — During moments of near silence among the Catholic archbishop of Kansas City and hundreds of people gathered in prayer inside the Assumption Church in Topeka, chants, shouts and sometimes sirens penetrated the church doors.
While competing religious protests clashed on the Capitol grounds across the street, as many as 400 people convened in the church to participate in prayer, ceremony and a mass that was meant to be an “antidote” to the “unbelieving secular society.”
The services were part of a series of counterefforts planned in response to a “black mass.” The black mass, planned by a nonprofit organization not affiliated with the Satanist Temple, the Satanic Grotto. After the event’s announcement on Facebook in February, outrage ensued. 
Leading up to Friday’s satanic protest, Christian counterprotests and Catholic services, the archbishop, Joseph Naumann, sued the grotto’s president, Michael Stewart, who was arrested Friday around 11:30 a.m. after entering the Statehouse. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and legislative leadership tried in advance to limit the protest through modifications to Stewart’s permit to gather and new restrictions on Capitol building rules. A handful of Republican legislators attended the mass.

Naumann gave a sermon condemning the protests that were meant to cause “confusion” and “chaos,” he said. The efforts fostered confrontation and conflict, he said, and were designed to be “provocative.”
“What I do not understand is why we are giving our Capitol as a venue for what truly is hate speech,” he said.
He drew a connection between satanists and atheists after dissecting Stewart’s previous claims of religiosity, calling him a “so-called satanic worshiper but really an atheist.”
“The group — who is really pro-choice, pro-abortion and atheist — present their abortion advocacy as part of their fake religion so that they can claim religious rights are being violated by any efforts to provide protection to the unborn and their mothers,” Naumann said.
The antidote to the religious conflict unfolding in Topeka, Naumann said, was allowing people to see their faith.

“It’s sad, those who are trying to desecrate the Capitol today, desecrate symbols of faith — Bibles and crucifixes. Thank God, we don’t believe they have a consecrated host, but this is a sad state of life for them to be in. We need to pray for them,” he said.
Naumann’s lawsuit, which was dropped soon after it was filed, revolved around false claims that Stewart had obtained a consecrated host.
Inside and outside the church, law enforcement officers stood on watch as throngs of people gathered and moved on the Capitol grounds while those inside the church stayed mostly still.
Natalie Rowe, a 68-year-old lifelong Catholic, said she traveled Friday morning to Topeka from Wichita to be part of a strong showing. Before the mass began, she attended the archbishop’s eucharistic adoration, which involves praying before a consecrated host.
“The universe is very important to me,” she said. “My faith is very important to me.”

Alice Wade, a Dover Democrat and a transgender lawmaker, speaks against House Bill 148, which would roll back some anti-discrimination protections for transgender people, on Thursday, March 20, 2025.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Transgender children and teenagers would be barred from receiving hormone therapy and puberty blockers under a bill that passed the New Hampshire House Thursday on nearly party lines.
House Bill 377 would prohibit any medical procedures for people under 18 “for the purpose of altering or attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex.” That prohibition includes puberty-blocking and hormone medication. 
Democrats decried the bill as discriminatory against transgender children, and said parents should be able to decide whether their children should have the treatments. Opponents noted that the medications would be denied only to minors who are seeking to realize their gender identity but would still be available for certain physical conditions, which they said meant the bill is aimed at transgender people.
The bill “unfairly targets a very small number of minors from getting the care that their parents and their medical providers believe they need,” said Rep. Jessica LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat. “Despite what some proponents of this bill are telling you, these drugs are used safely and effectively for other reasons and their effects are reversible.”
A number of Democratic representatives read testimony from children who have received gender-affirming medication and have improved their lives. 
But Republicans argued the procedures are dangerous, are difficult to undo, and that too little is known about their side effects.
“These drugs are not perfectly safe,” said Rep. Erica Layon, a Derry Republican. “Anybody who says that is misleading parents, misleading kids, and misleading all of us.”
Much of the Republican caucus left the House chamber during Democrats’ speeches opposing the bill. 
The act specifically bans medical procedures “enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex and asserted identity.” Medical professionals who violate the proposed law could be charged with a Class B felony, which can carry up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to $4,000.
The bill has exceptions for procedures for minors “with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development.” And it would allow medical professionals who had already started a minor on such treatment before the bill takes effect to continue the treatment if stopping it “would cause harm to the minor,” but requires the dosage to be tapered and reduced. 
The bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
HB 377 would expand upon a bill that passed in 2024 and that banned gender transition “bottom” surgeries for people under 18 in New Hampshire. Research indicates that gender-affirming procedures are rare for minors; a 2025 study from Harvard analyzing insurance claims from 2018 to 2022 found that about 0.1 percent of adolescents between age 8 and 17 have received puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy.
LaMontagne argued the bill prevented families from making the decision to support their child, and said the procedures usually follow years of therapy and discussion. 
“This body just passed the parental bill of rights that includes the right to make health care decisions,” she said. “So I call on all of you that voted for the parental bill of rights: Do you believe that parents know best, or do you not?”
Rep. Alice Wade, a Dover Democrat who is transgender, said the therapies helped her transition and saved her life during a period when she was suicidal. Wade transitioned after she turned 18 but argued that other teenagers benefit from the procedures. 
“Imagine receiving life-saving care, then having someone with no understanding or experience try to rip that away from you because they think they know better,” Wade said. 
She added: “When people in this body say that we need nuanced discussions and compromise, I agree. The problem is that my position is I’d like to have access to health care, equal treatment, and to mind my own business.” 
But Rep. Lisa Mazur, a Goffstown Republican, argued that children and families did not know the risks of what they are choosing to adopt.
“Children cannot fully comprehend the lifelong consequences of altering their bodies with powerful medications,” Mazur said. “… Gender dysphoria is real and it’s painful, and those struggling deserve compassion, but rushing minors into irreversible medical interventions is not the answer.”
Layon added: “Parents can’t give informed consent if they aren’t told of the risks of drugs and if they are told that the only alternative to treatment is as a dead child, because that is coercion and not consent.”
The bill passed 197-167, with two Democrats, Reps. Dale Girard of Claremont and Jonah Wheeler of Peterborough, joining Republicans in favor, and four Republicans, Reps. Nicholas Bridle of Hampton, David Nagel of Gilmanton, John Styek of Salem, and Susan Vandecasteele of Salem, joining Democrats opposed.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A state lawmaker wants to create a process to allow voters to recall elected state officials.
The Senate on Thursday passed Senate Bill 990, which is expected to be the vehicle to set up the process that Oklahomans can use to remove someone from office independent of the involvement from the Legislature.
“We all got to this room here by the will of the people, and currently, the only way a person can be removed from office is not by the will of the people,” said Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City. “It’s by our friends across the rotunda, and it’s on this body to remove somebody from statewide elective office.”
In Oklahoma, impeachment proceedings start in the House. If the House votes to impeach, a trial is held in the Senate and requires two-third of the senators, who serve as jurors,  to vote to remove a state official from office. 
Grounds for impeachment include willful neglect of duty, corruption in office, habitual drunkenness, incompetency, or any offense involving moral turpitude committed while in office. 
“What I want to do is change that to where the people, the people that elect somebody, decide whether or not somebody should be recalled,” Coleman said.
He said he envisions an initiative petition-like process requiring those seeking a recall election to collect signatures from 25% of the voters who cast ballots in the last gubernatorial election.
“It needs to be a high bar because overturning the will of the people is a big deal,” he said.
In order for citizens to qualify an initiative petition for the ballot, they must collect signatures from 8% of voters in the last gubernatorial election. 
To get a constitutional amendment on the ballot requires signatures from 15%.
Coleman said the final bill will have some guardrails so a person can’t be removed just because they are unpopular.
The current version of the bill only applies to statewide officers. Coleman said it will apply to state lawmakers.
Coleman said he has had a request to have it include county officers.
The current version creates a procedure for the Legislature to start the process, but Coleman wants to alter the measure so it can be done by members of the public.
“This is about a process, a process that the people of Oklahoma are locked out of,” Coleman said.
Sen. Dana Prieto, R-Tulsa, voted against the measure.
“This has the potential to be greatly abused,” Prieto said. “We have a process for it already and that is called elections.”
Some Democratic lawmakers have called for the impeachment of state Superintendent Ryan Walters, a Republican. But former House Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, said the House would not pursue it unless Walters committed a crime.
In 2004, the Oklahoma House impeached Insurance Commissioner Carroll Fisher, a Democrat who had been convicted of embezzlement and perjury.
Fisher resigned before the Senate could hear the matter.
Senate Bill 990 passed by a vote of 31-15 and is available for consideration in the House.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Before the legislative session, Senate President Ben Albritton said tackling hunger would be one of his priorities. That is reflected in the $50 million slated for food bank grants in the Senate’s budget proposal unveiled this week.
While budget negotiations are just ramping up, the additional funding from the Senate could help food banks weather the loss of millions in federal funds they used to buy fresh produce.
Florida received $46.4 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, created in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act and later expanded by the Biden administration, according to a USDA database.
However, the Trump administration canceled the program earlier this month, meaning food banks won’t receive grants to purchase produce from farms they expected to get in the fall.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

What’s more, food bank directors learned this week of a funding freeze for federal food shipments through the USDA.
“It’s a big blow to our food bank network,” said Robin Safley, executive director of Feeding Florida, a network of nine food banks. “We have not seen a decline in demand. In fact, we’re probably seeing that inch up with some of the layoffs, as well. So it definitely is putting a huge and critical burden on our food banks.”
While Albritton teased the grant programs in the budget proposal before the session started, Safley says those funds are even more necessary in light of the federal funding cuts.
The Senate proposal includes two grant programs through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services: $12 million to expand the infrastructure of food banks in rural communities, and another $38 million to help food banks buy products from Florida farmers.
“We’re running to this fight to connect hungry families across our state with Florida farmers who produce fresh, wholesome food,” Albritton wrote in a press release on Wednesday. “This is a much-needed hand-up for families and farmers across our state. As I travel the state, attacking food insecurity unites Floridians like nothing else can. Food matters.”
Feeding Florida would work with the agriculture department to identify which rural areas and underserved communities would get the funds for the infrastructure program.
“The cuts that are coming from the federal government are pretty severe, as well,” Safley said. “I guess it does soften the blow, because it’s money that we wouldn’t have had. Obviously, it has a long way to go in the Legislature.”
However, the House agriculture budget proposal doesn’t include either program, and House Speaker Daniel Perez is pushing for a $5 billion sales tax cut.

That’s according to a new state law Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed on Friday.
Senate Bill 73 changes New Mexico’s traffic law to allow cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs, and to treat red traffic lights as stop signs and proceed if there are no other cars, cyclists or pedestrians.
While it may seem counterintuitive to people who don’t use bicycles, this is already common practice among bicycle riders in New Mexico because a cyclist wants to carry their momentum on the bike, said Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, who carried the bill, during a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Doing this gets the cyclist out of the blind spot of motorists who have stopped at an intersection, Sedillo Lopez told the committee.
Eric Biedermann, a board member at-large of nonprofit advocacy organization BikeABQ, told the committee being able to treat a stop sign as a yield sign and a traffic light as a stop sign enhances cyclist safety because it reduces their exposure to cars, increases their visibility to cars and reduces the risk of being “right hooked” if a car doesn’t see them or a “left cross” from oncoming traffic.
“There are a number of ways in which being able to proceed through an intersection with a head start before the cars move really enhances cyclist safety,” Biedermann told the committee. He was also speaking on behalf of Bike Santa Fe and Velo Cruces.
The so-called “Idaho stop” — taking its name from the first U.S. state to ease traffic laws for cyclists — resulted in a 14.5% reduction in cyclist injuries a year after the state of Idaho enacted a similar law in 1982, according to a review of Idaho Office of Highway Safety data.
In New Mexico, between 2019 and 2023, 1,457 cyclists had crashes, according to the University of New Mexico Geospatial and Population Studies Center. Of those, 39 were killed, 115 were seriously injured and 694 were able to walk away.
Lynn Pickard, a retired New Mexico Court of Appeals judge and member of Santa Fe Seniors on Bikes, told the committee data show that as many as half of collisions between cars and bikes happen within intersections.
“So anything we can do to get cyclists into and out of the intersections quickly — leaving of course, for us, to determine our own safety if there are other cars there or pedestrians there — would be really helpful for us,” she said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)An eastern Washington school board is pleading for urgent federal intervention to force the state to comply with the Trump administration’s policy on transgender athletes.

In a complaint filed this week with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, the Kennewick School Board said it’s in a bind: Either comply with state law and jeopardize federal funding, or follow President Donald Trump and risk punishment from the state.
“The Kennewick School Board is committed to ensuring the protection of biological female athletics, maintaining ‘all-female’ locker rooms separate from male locker rooms, and prioritizing the privacy rights of our students,” the complaint reads. “However, we find ourselves caught between conflicting directives that threaten not only our federal funding but also the rights and values of the families we serve.”
The board, with 19,000 students enrolled this school year, filed the complaint against the state, Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal, his office and the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association over “open and egregious Title IX violations.”
Last month, Trump signed an executive order seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports by, in part, withholding federal funding for districts that “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.” 
The board specifically cites the state-sanctioned participation of a transgender track athlete as a violation of that order. They also see conflicts between state law and Trump’s orders in policies on preferred pronouns, parental rights, and restroom access based on gender identity.
Enacted in 1972, Title IX prohibited sex-based discrimination in schools receiving federal funding. The civil rights law increased the participation of female student athletes, and also provided an avenue for girls and women to bring complaints of sex discrimination. 
The school board approved the complaint in a 4-0 vote Wednesday, with board member Michael Connors abstaining. In the meeting, Connors told his colleagues, “we took a vow to follow the laws. Full stop.”
“The only way we do this is by finding a way to change the law,” he continued. “So if you guys think we can do that with this letter, then go nuts. I’m not taking any part of this deal because I have already stated we should not be going down this political road.”
In a statement, Reykdal said his office “has continued to advise Washington’s school districts to stay in compliance with state law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity.” 
He added Trump’s order “attempts to override the authority of states and local school districts by requiring educational institutions to agree to discriminate against trans female athletes in order to continue receiving federal funds.”
“An executive order is not law, and it does not override state law,” Reykdal continued. “OSPI will enforce our current laws as we are required to do in a constitutional democracy until Congress changes the law and/or federal courts invalidate Washington state’s laws.”
He said the state is prepared to take legal action if the Trump administration withholds funding.
The U.S. Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday on the complaint.
This is the latest in the developing federal-state showdown over trans athletes participating in sports in line with their gender identity. Broadly, the Trump administration has tried in its first two months in office to limit how transgender people participate in American society. 
This month, the Department of Education launched an investigation into the Tumwater School District, near Olympia, for letting a transgender athlete from another school compete in a girls’ high school basketball game. A district spokesperson had no update on the case Friday.
In a very similar letter to the one from Kennewick, the Mead School Board outside Spokane also asked for federal intervention on the issue, but stopped short of filing a formal complaint.
And the Moses Lake School Board also asked for federal help last week. 
The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association, tasked with setting policy for school sports, is scheduled to vote next month on two proposals related to trans girls playing sports. One would bar trans girls from participating in girls’ sports. Another would create a separate division where trans athletes can compete.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Nearly 20 years ago, my wife and I were lucky enough to study abroad in England. We had been awarded graduate scholarships and obtained our student visas from the British government. At the time, there was a heartbreaking genocide happening in Darfur. As concerned students invested in the moral standing of our university, we joined peaceful protests calling on Oxford to divest from companies that profited from the genocide and urged the British Parliament to intervene.

I never feared that my exercise of free speech would get me arrested and kicked out of what I took to be the second freest nation on earth, after my own. And I certainly could not have imagined a swarm of British agents abducting me on the street and deporting me without cause. Perhaps in the time of King George III but not the age of constitutions.



On Tuesday, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University in Boston, was walking peacefully to the university’s Interfaith Center to break her Ramadan fast when six government agents in masks and hoodies surrounded her and took her away screaming in an unmarked SUV.
For a day or more, according to Fox News, Rumeysa’s family and lawyers had no idea where she was and were unable to contact her. No charges were filed against her. A federal district judge even ordered the government not to move her out of state. But she was moved anyway — to a detention center in Louisiana, awaiting deportation.
Rumeysa had a valid student visa, as Fox News also reported. She was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to complete her Ph.D. at Tufts’ Department of Child Study and Human Development, where she researches children and media. No charges were filed against her and there was no warrant for her arrest; warrants are issued by judges who require the government to show cause.
The best guess for why she has been detained is that her name appeared with several others on an article in the student newspaper last year calling on Tufts University to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The op-ed never mentioned Hamas, which the U.S. government rightly considers a terrorist organization. There is no evidence that she harbored any sympathy for, much less aided and abetted, Hamas or other organizations opposed to the United States. It seems her only “crime” was to peacefully speak out, as a concerned student, in a manner disfavored by the current administration.
Americans may freely disagree about the heartbreaking conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has left thousands of innocent Israelis and hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinians dead or injured in recent years. For my part, having traveled to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and believing in the state of Israel as a necessary response to the evils of the Holocaust (in which Jewish family members of mine were killed), I take seriously the conclusions of the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International that Israel’s war in Gaza is a “plausible” genocide.
But regardless of what we believe about Israel and Palestine, there is one thing on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: our constitutional right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment is sacred and immigrants who lawfully reside among us are not without rights of their own. As you uphold my right to call the war in Gaza genocidal, I defend your right to call Hamas an evil terrorist organization. In fact, I’ll join in that because it is also true.
Freedom of speech is as American as apple pie. It’s what has attracted many of the brightest minds from foreign lands to come here legally as students and help make America the richest, most innovative nation on earth — including Elon Musk.
Sadly, Rumeysa is not alone. She is one of hundreds of lawful immigrants so far who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration in recent weeks, without any pretense of due process. Their abductions on American streets by unmarked and unidentified “law enforcement” agents are being funded by our tax dollars to the tune of untold millions.
So far we have seen at least seven other students detained for showing sympathy for Palestinians; hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported to a Salvadoran prison camp against the orders of a federal judge, and extended detentions and physical abuse of lawful migrants at the American border. These and countless other acts represent an unprecedented abuse of federal power against individuals whose lack of citizenship gives them limited legal recourse, in spite of their legal status in this country.
Given the choice, I still believe my fellow Americans would choose the Constitution over a man who would be king. It’s time we make that choice — not just for Rumeysa but for this country we love.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The bullhorn-powered war of words between satanists and Catholics boiled over into brawling and a handful of arrests Friday during an extraordinary event at the Kansas Capitol that pushed boundaries of free speech and the separation of church and state.
After about two hours of speeches, prayers and sign waving among hundreds of people mostly segregated by barricades staffed by law enforcement officers, Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart, with supporters and reporters in tow, entering the Statehouse to conduct what he had described as a black mass. He was warned at the door to the visitors’ center that any formal protest inside the building that violated a permit limiting his religious expression to the lawn or steps of the Capitol would result in his arrest for trespassing.
In the rotunda, Stewart began the mass demonstration and was interrupted by three people intent on stopping an exercise that could be interpreted a mockery of their faith. An unidentified man and woman, with young kids at their side, physically intervened to stop Stewart. He turned away from them. Counter-protester Marcus Schroeder joined the fray and twice reached to take papers from Stewart’s hand. Stewart responded by punching Schroeder in the face twice. More than half a dozen Capitol Police wrestled Stewart to the floor to make the arrest.
“I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting. I’m not resisting,” Stewart repeatedly yelled.
Schroeder, who wore a shirt declaring “Death is not welcome here,” wasn’t arrested by Capitol Police. In an interview, he defended his maneuvering to thwart Stewart.
“I tried to take his papers. He punched me in the face,” he said.
After the area cleared, two other satanists tried to pick up where Stewart left off and were taken into custody. One other person was cuffed and taken away by law enforcement outside the Capitol on Friday. An individual grabbed Stewart by the legs in a bid to stop Stewart from stomping on crackers intended to represent those used in a Catholic mass to represent the consecrated body and soul of Christ. In that brief exchange, Stewart also punched the guy before law enforcement stepped in.
“He was was trying to tackle me to get to the cracker underneath,” Stewart said. “I was able to kind of fend him off. I do think he may have picked up the crumbled cracker and ate it. Did I get physical with him? Yes.”
 
  Hundreds of Christians upset with an organization’s plan to conduct a satanic black mass at the Capitol delivered a robust counter-protest to emphasize their disdain for followers of Satanic Grotto. Both sides of the debate used bullhorns to punctuate their messages, creating a blended sound that was difficult for anybody to hear clearly. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)
The opposition
The colorful display of affection and affliction for organized religion culminated attempts by Gov. Laura Kelly, Attorney General Kris Kobach, leaders of the Kansas Legislature and Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, to derail the demonstration planned by Satanic Grotto.
Kelly had the group’s permit amended so no protest could transpire inside the Capitol. Legislative leaders modified policy regarding use of the Capitol to specifically target Satanic Grotto. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, said the First Amendment didn’t protect offensive speech or violations of law.
Francis Slobodnik, a Topeka representative of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, told hundreds of Catholics gathered on the south side of the Capitol that state public officials shouldn’t have allowed satanists to assemble on public property. He said the event reflected a misguided understanding of freedom of speech and religion and a lack of appreciation for how a black mass represented worship of Satan.
“Today’s horrific event, the first of its kind in the history of Kansas, is a sacrilege,” Slobodnik said. “Of course, there have been terrible crimes and injustices that have happened in our state over the years. However, nothing in our past compares with what is happening today where God is being directly challenged on the state Capitol grounds. The state Capitol represents all of us.”
He praised the people present at the rally to stand in opposition to Satanic Grotto, referring to them as the Navy Seals of the Catholic faith. He said these activists were willing to confront God’s enemies head-on as if on a field of battle. He said the great sin perpetrated by Stewart and other worshipers of Satan meant that others had to step into the void.
“Satanists do not realize that Satan hates all of God’s creation, including them,” Slobodnik said. “Their reward for worshiping and serving him will be eternal fire.”
 
And, an exorcist
Former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who served in the Kansas Senate before elected to Congress, said he consulted with a priest with experience in exorcism to figure whether he should participate in a television interview with Stewart.
“Father had a simple question: ‘Why would you do this? What do you hope to gain?’ I stumbled around in my answer,” Huelskamp said. “I wanted to share the truth about Christ. The truth about the Eucharist. His summary response was quite stunning to me. He said, ‘There is no good that could come from being in the same room with a Satanist.'”
Huelskamp said it was suggested his participation in the interview with Stewart might serve interests of Satan. The former Republican congressman woke ill the next day, and cancelled the interview. In the end, Huelskamp said he decided it was important to run to the fire created by Satan rather than shrink from it. He said it was the same as making his views known about the evil of abortion and defending the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman.
“I am quite stubborn and hardheaded,” he said. “We cannot be silent. We are required, if we call ourselves Christians, if we call ourselves Catholic, we are publicly required to defend the faith and to stand up for the truth.”
In an interview amid calm before the storm of his arrest, Stewart said he was convinced Catholics assembled around him didn’t understand why Satanic Grotto was at the Capitol to talk about religious oppression.
“What we only want is the rights that every American has,” Stewart said. “I’ve heard people say we’re setting a precedent. Well, if the precedent is freedom of religion for everyone in public spaces, yes, that’s what we’re trying to establish. We are dragging this issue out in the light and we’ll let the people look at it. The issue is that we’re not all being treated the same here.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stewart-arrest-peace-signs-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-03-28 15:03:19.983995

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The University of Louisiana System has named an interim president at its Monroe campus to step in and deal with the university’s budget shortfall while a search for a permanent president plays out. 
The UL System Board of Supervisors Executive Committee met Friday to make the unusual move of installing former UL-Monroe leader Nick Bruno to fill the role and putting current President Ronald Berry on administrative leave during the search for his permanent replacement. 
UL System Board Chairman Mark Romero said an interim president was chosen to deal with the university’s budget shortfall. ULM has to find a way to fill a $5 million to $6 million hole by the end of the fiscal year in June, according to UL System President Rick Gallot. The gap could be addressed through a combination of cuts and transfers from the university’s foundation and other supporting organizations, Gallot said, but Bruno will ultimately determine the specifics. 
Berry was placed on administrative leave effective immediately, with Bruno taking over Monday. Bill Graves, ULM vice president for business affairs, was deputized to make any decisions for the university over the weekend. 
Berry’s administrative leave is not punitive, Romero and Gallot said, and he will continue to be paid during the transition period. Berry receives an annual salary of $305,704, and he will return to the classroom as a professor at the university in the fall. 
Berry has served as university president since 2020, when Bruno retired after 10 years in charge. 
Romero said Bruno, 73, is not likely to seek the permanent position, which the board hopes to fill in May.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposes the pipeline, citing concerns for its water supply. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal judge dismissed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to shutter the Dakota Access Pipeline, finding that the tribe must wait until the Army Corps finishes a key environmental study to bring another legal challenge against the agency.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a Friday order.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, arguing that Corps is violating federal law by allowing the pipeline to operate without an easement. The tribe also claimed that the Corps failed to properly study the environmental impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline or require its developer to prepare adequate spill response plans, among other alleged violations.
The suit is a successor to a lawsuit the tribe filed against the same agency in 2016.
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


In that case, Boasberg in 2020 found the Army Corps had violated federal law by not conducting a full environmental impact study before granting an easement allowing the pipeline to cross underneath the Missouri River. He pulled the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be drained of oil pending the Army Corps’ completion of the study. 
An appellate court in 2021 reversed Boasberg’s decision to shut down the pipeline, but did not reinstate the easement.
Boasberg wrote in a 2021 order following that decision that he could not shutter the pipeline because the tribe hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that it posed an immediate threat of irreparable harm.
He noted in his Friday memo that “remarkably little” has changed in the four years since.
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends,” Boasberg wrote at the beginning of the order, quoting Shakespeare’s “Henry V”.
The Army Corps still has not finished the environmental impact study. It published a draft version of its report in late 2023. Once the study is complete, the Army Corps will use it to decide whether to grant the easement again.
One of the main arguments the tribe made in its 2024 lawsuit is that the Army Corps’ yearslong inaction on the Dakota Access Pipeline is a violation of federal law.
Boasberg wrote previously that, given the pipeline is operating on Army Corps land without proper authorization, the agency in the interim could have done something to enforce its property rights.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in his 2021 order.
But the Army Corps for now is not legally required to do anything but finish the environmental impact study, Boasberg stated in the Friday memo.
He said that other arguments Standing Rock raised in its complaint seek to relitigate issues that were already decided in the 2016 case, and that the legal landscape is not likely to change until the study is completed.
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe files new lawsuit over DAPL

Boasberg noted that Standing Rock can file another lawsuit against the Corps once the study is published. The Army Corps of Engineers in legal filings also argued the tribe cannot sue the Corps over the easement when it had not yet made a final decision on the permit.
The tribe indicated last fall that it had new evidence to present related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
North Dakota, other states and pipeline owner Dakota Access intervened in the lawsuit on the side of the Corps. The intervenors called on the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the pipeline is important to the country’s economy, and that shutting it down would violate states’ rights and make road and rail transit less safe.
“The Dakota Access Pipeline has been operating safely for almost eight years now and is a critical piece of infrastructure for North Dakota and our nation’s energy security,” North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement regarding Boasberg’s decision.
A spokesperson for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment.
“The Corps has failed to act and failed to protect the tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in an October press conference announcing the lawsuit.
The pipeline, which spans more than 1,000 miles, carries crude oil from northwest North Dakota to Illinois. Its pathway includes unceded land recognized as the Sioux Nation’s in 19th century treaties signed by the U.S. government.

Spencer Cox signed a legislative proposal into law Thursday night. The action comes amid a wave of skepticism toward public health measures exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fluoride often occurs naturally in water systems, but some local governments have added extra to help prevent cavities. While dentists have attributed dramatic improvements in oral health to the practice — especially in vulnerable communities — some question whether ingesting the substance is safe, even in the relatively low levels water systems use.

HB81, sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, blurred party lines on its legislative path, but it ultimately passed the Legislature with comfortable margins. The bill’s approval also undoes a longtime practice of leaving it to municipalities in the state to allow their constituents to vote on whether to add fluoride to their water. 
However, the discussion, Gricius said during bill presentations, was still about freedom of choice.
Utah Legislature approves ban on cities adding fluoride in public water

“I would just say it doesn’t get more local control than my own body,” she said about potentially overriding the decisions of local governments.
Many members of the public lined up during committee hearings, showing a definite divide on the issue; dentists expressed concern about the adverse public health consequences of removing fluoride from the state’s drinking water, and some local government representatives supported the bill, citing economic woes and worries about controlling dosages.
Similar anti-fluoridation efforts have emerged across the country, while public health experts warn that the skepticism has been fueled by problematic studies and misinformation. 
The bill doesn’t prohibit Utahns from taking fluoride supplements if they choose, and opens the door for pharmacists to prescribe it.
However, dentists worry that may not be enough to fight tooth decay. 
“Despite my efforts in education, in prescribing fluoride and working with parents, the voluntary application does not always work for those that may be most vulnerable,” Dr. Sarah Woolsey, a family physician who has practiced for decades in Utah underserved communities, said during a House Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Committee hearing in January.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on Friday announced business-focused Indianapolis attorney Jennifer Ruby will take over the state’s vacant public access counselor role.
“Transparency for Hoosiers is important for a healthy state government, and Jennifer Ruby brings decades of legal expertise to serve Hoosiers as Public Access Counselor,” Braun said in a news release. “She will do a great job promoting public trust through transparency and accountability.”
Ruby said she was “honored” to be chosen for the job — and to “uphold the values of government transparency and accountability.”
“Public access is essential for effective governance, and I look forward to serving our state in this role,” she added.
Ruby is president, CEO and lead attorney at her Indianapolis-based firm, Ruby Law. She counsels clients on estate and succession planning; real estate issues; contracts and “general business issues,” according to her LinkedIn — although her “favorite areas of interest” are identified as life sciences, information technology, education and business development. She also is a mediator.
Ruby holds a law degree and a master’s degree in planning from Indiana University, and an undergraduate degree in biochemistry from Purdue University.
Hoosier lawmakers decline to remove public records chief restrictions

The Office of the Public Access Counselor provides guidance on state public records and open meeting laws: it responds to informal inquiries on the laws, issues non-binding advisory opinions, recommends improvements to the Indiana General Assembly, educates officials and Hoosiers on rights and responsibilities, and more, according to the office’s website.
The General Assembly created the office in 1999.
Until last year, the officeholder served four-year terms — and could only be fired “for cause.” But lawmakers changed that during the last legislative session.
Now, the governor can remove the public access counselor at any time — leaving the appointee vulnerable to dismissal for opinions that powerful state leaders dislike. The officeholder is also now limited to using only the law’s “plain text” and official court orders in writing those opinions.
Indiana’s longest-serving public access counselor, Luke Britt, stepped down in February, several months after the changes went into effect. His resignation came after 12 years; he was first appointed in 2013 by Republican former Gov. Mike Pence and reappointed twice by former Gov. Eric Holcomb, also a Republican.
Britt told WFYI that his role was “fundamentally changed.”
“I’d always said that if I found that my voice was getting ineffective, it was time to leave. And that might have been my sign with that legislation,” he said.

Brad Ketcher, a St. Louis attorney who was chief of staff to Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in the 1990s, said he hopes the effort spreads to other states to fight back against Tesla CEO Elon Musk for his lead role in mass federal layoffs and budget cuts for President Donald Trump.
“If Elon Musk was not cutting Medicaid and Social Security and veterans health to fund a tax cut for billionaires and doing it with a bizarre glee, we would not be asking Missourians to say this guy does not deserve to be doing business in this state,” Ketcher said. “We would not be trying to drive this in Missouri.”
Tesla did not immediately respond to an email from The Independent seeking comment on the initiative.
Soon after winning election in November, Trump named Musk to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency with instructions to find savings in the federal budget.
Since taking office, Musk has, among other actions, closed the U.S. Agency for International Development, been granted access to payment systems delivering benefits to millions of Americans, put the entire Department of Education on the chopping block and slashed the staff of the Social Security Administration.
Many of those actions have been challenged in court and temporarily halted. Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, are pushing through a budget resolution that would extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 while making deep cuts in Medicaid and food programs.
The initiatives filed with the secretary of state’s office would use Missouri’s law governing motor vehicle sales, which requires new cars, trucks and motorcycles to be sold through franchised dealers, to force Tesla out. Two versions were filed Friday, and more may be written before the signature drive begins, Ketcher said.
The petitions must be reviewed and put out for public comment before the signature drive.
Prior to the arrival of Tesla, all new motor vehicles sold in Missouri were purchased at authorized franchises with ownership independent of the manufacturer. In 2013, the Department of Revenue licensed a franchise owned by Tesla for a St. Louis showroom and followed it up the next year by licensing a Kansas City showroom.
The initiatives would cause those licenses to be revoked. The first version filed states that “it is the express intent of the people to prevent any manufacturer of new motor vehicles from circumventing the public policy as stated in (state law) by engaging in methods of retailing new motor vehicles which are designed to avoid the provisions” of that law.
To make the ballot, the committee called UnPlug Musk must gather at least 106,384 signatures properly distributed among six of the state’s congressional districts. The petition drive must be complete by the start of May 2026.
Ketcher said that so far, he and former state Rep. Deb Lavender, a St. Louis County Democrat, treasurer of the committee, are the only people enlisted for the effort. He hopes to build a coalition quickly, he said.
“This gives Missourians a chance to say this guy is not welcome to do business in our state,” Ketcher said.
The petition drive would not be the first attempt to use state law to keep Tesla from opening its company-owned showrooms in Missouri. In 2014, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, then a state senator, helped write a provision for a bill that fell just short of passing to require all auto manufacturers to sell their vehicles through a franchise dealership.
Kehoe owned Ford and Lincoln-Mercury franchises in Jefferson City from 1992 to 2011. He sold the dealerships before entering politics.
He told the Springfield News-Leader in 2014 that he was surprised the department issued a dealership license to Tesla.
“Our question as dealers and people I know in the business: how in the world when we’ve worked so hard to get franchise legislation, how in the world could that be possible?” Kehoe said to the News-Leader.
The Missouri Automobile Dealers Association and others sued the department over its licensing decision, winning at the trial court level before the Western District Court of Appeals ruled none of the plaintiffs had a legal right to challenge the licenses.
In its briefs for the appeals court, Tesla acknowledged that the legislature could block it from having manufacturer-owned dealerships.
“Plainly, if the legislature had wanted to erect a blanket direct sales ban, it could and would have done so clearly and straightforwardly by amending the existing partial ban in the franchise act,” attorneys wrote.
The auto dealers did not return a call seeking comment on the initiative.
There are some states where Tesla is not operating dealerships because of franchise laws. In Wisconsin, where Musk is spending millions on the state Supreme Court election, Tesla is suing to overturn the franchise law.
Ketcher said he wants the effort to be joined by groups from other states with the initiative petition process and Democratically-controlled legislatures.
“Even in red states, somebody can hold up an amendment, and say, here’s the amendment to drive Tesla, drive Musk, out of our state,” he said.
The language of the initiative, Ketcher said, is taken, with only technical changes, from the provisions Kehoe supplied for the 2014 bill. Tesla attorneys acknowledged during the litigation that it would effectively shut down their showrooms, Ketcher noted.
“They’ve given us plans for the Death Star,” Ketcher said. “And when when somebody gives you the plans for Death Star, you know what to do.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Providence Public School District (PPSD) finished sending out its annual batch of “displacement” notices earlier this week, letting teachers know they would need to find and apply for alternate positions in the city’s 37 schools. 
The number of teachers being shuffled around is nearly half as many as it was last year: There were 209 Providence Teachers Union (PTU) positions displaced this year, compared to 384 last year.
“To be clear, being displaced is not the same as being laid off or non-renewed,” Herman James, the district’s chief talent officer wrote, in a March 24 letter updating the Providence School Board on this year’s displacements. In his letter, James gave the hypothetical example of a school that’s slimming its social studies department, meaning a qualified teacher will have to find a relevant job elsewhere in another of the district’s schools.  
The three highest categories of teachers displaced this year were those working in high school English language arts (31 displacements) and special education (24 displacements), followed by 23 displacements issued for elementary school teachers. There were 16 displacements for both physical education instructors and early childhood teachers, and nine for English as Second Language teachers.
Jay G. Wégimont, a spokesperson for PPSD, said via email the displacement process happens annually each spring and is shaped by the teachers’ union contract. 
“It’s worth noting that this happens in large urban districts across the country and this annual staffing process occurs in districts across Rhode Island due to shifts in student enrollment, programmatic changes, budgetary considerations, and licensure compliance requirements,” Wégimont wrote. 
The Providence Teachers Union did not respond to requests for comment, but has expressed concern in the past to media outlets that displaced teachers aren’t always able to find equivalent positions and can potentially face layoffs. 
There are more available positions in the district than there are displacements, according to James’ letter. As of Wednesday, there are 260 open positions for PTU roles, according to James.
There were also 95 teacher assistants displaced this year. They’ll be able to vie for 104 open positions starting April 7, according to James’ letter. Last year, 206 teacher assistants received displacement notices. 
Last year’s considerable number of teacher displacements derived partly from school mergers and closures which saw educators shuffled around from schools like 360 High School and Gilbert Stuart Middle School, both of which closed last spring. 
In 2024, enrollment in the state-controlled public school district rose 2% — the first increase since the 2018 school year, according to data from the state education department.

The student’s identity was not shared by the university, but Crimson White, the university’s student-run newspaper, reported Wednesday evening that Alireza Doroudi was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) early Tuesday morning.
According to ICE detainee locator, as of Thursday morning Doroudi was “in ICE custody,” but it does not list the detention facility. House did not respond to whether UA is trying to locate the student, but a person at the Pickens County Jail confirmed late Thursday morning that he was being held at the facility and should be transported to an ICE facility in the next couple of days, though they declined to provide their identity.
It’s unclear why Doroudi was detained, but Christian Martin, a student organizer with Students for Justice in Palestine, said in a statement that Doroudi had no involvement with the organization or the protests related to the organization.
“We recognize that there is minimal information about the cause for M. Doroudi’s detainment,” Martin said in a statement, adding that “Doroudi was not nor has ever been involved with Students for Justice in Palestine.”
International students across the country have been detained by ICE in recent weeks. Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia student, was detained by immigration officials in early March for his role in negotiations with the university over protests due to the war in Gaza. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was taken Tuesday night by immigration officials who had their faces covered. One resident who witnessed Ozturk said it looked like a “kidnapping.” Barnard College student Yunseo Chung was detained after she participated in the protests against the war. Chung has sued to prevent deportation.
According to the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, 1,207 international students were enrolled at the University of Alabama in Fall 2024.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) LSU released a list of budget belt-tightening measures Friday in response to the uncertainty of federal funding as President Donald Trump’s administration slashes research spending. 
The university will implement a hiring freeze, eliminate “duplicative” jobs and centralize some positions. It will also withhold 2% of each department’s budget starting July 1 and will convene a committee to explore using artificial intelligence to “reduce administrative burdens and enhance productivity.” 
“Uncertainty in federal funding and future support should not hinder our growth or momentum. Instead, we must transform challenges into opportunities,” LSU President William Tate wrote in a campus wide email sent Friday morning. 
Universities, particularly research institutions such as LSU, are bracing for tough times as the Trump administration makes dramatic reductions to agencies that fund research on college campuses, medical schools and affiliated research institutions. Many of these cuts are on pause, pending the outcome of litigation. 
LSU spent $488 million on research in fiscal year 2023, the most recent period for which data is available. Most of that money came from federal grants. 
LSU could lose $12 million if the Trump administration’s proposed cut to indirect costs for National Institutes of Health grants are allowed to go into effect, and it would lose tens of millions more if other agencies followed suit. 
The research universities conduct has an economic impact as well as an academic one. Federal research grants directly support hundreds of graduate assistants and other employees at universities. LSU estimates the economic impact of NIH funding alone is around $550 million. 
Departments can earn back 0.5% of the 2% being withheld if they meet certain benchmarks, Tate wrote, including the “removal of student hurdles to progression,” though he did not provide any specific details on what that will entail. The other 1.5% will go to a fund to support academic and research initiatives. 
In addition to the budget restrictions, Tate said the university is looking to expand LSU Online enrollment. LSU Online is distinct from the university, which does offer some online courses as part of its on-campus degree programs. Tate said this expansion will support the university’s growth. 
Tate’s email also announced initiatives for student success and growing research spending. LSU is seeking to gain entry into the prestigious Association of American Universities. To do so, it has to expand its research spending significantly, which will be difficult as the Trump administration puts university funding in its crosshairs.

DemasA decade after taking the lead on matters of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, at the university level, the University of Michigan announced Thursday it will cease all formal efforts in that regard. 
In an email sent to faculty, staff and the university community, officials said they were closing U of M’s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Office for Health Equity and Inclusion, while also halting its DEI 2.0 Strategic Plan
The changes, which are effective immediately, come in the wake of executive orders from President Donald Trump ending all DEI “mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities” in the federal government, and forbidding federal contractors from considering “race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin” in employment, procurement, and contracting practices.
“These decisions have not been made lightly. We recognize the changes are significant and will be challenging for many of us, especially those whose lives and careers have been enriched by and dedicated to programs that are now pivoting,” stated an email signed by university officials, including President Santa J. Ono and Provost Laurie K. McCauley.
Noting that federal actions against DEI programming had intensified in recent weeks, including another executive order to “facilitate the closure” of the U.S. Education Department, university officials said the decisions were made after an “assessment of input from various stakeholders regarding our DEI programs…and after conversations with Regents, university leaders, deans and government officials”. It’s not known exactly how many employees will be impacted by the changes, but a 2021 report by the Heritage Foundation, the same organization that produced Project 2025, U of M employed 163 people on DEI initiatives.
The announcement is a complete turnaround for the university which previously touted itself as having led “an unprecedented campus-wide DEI Strategic Plan in 2015,” in which it had “shown uncommon leadership in its commitment to higher education access, equity, and positive cultural change.” That initial plan ran from 2016 to 2021.
The university’s DEI 2.0 Strategic Plan, launched in 2023 and initially set to continue through 2028, will be halted immediately. It had a stated “commitment to ensuring a diverse, equitable and inclusive community with even more sharply defined goals, new innovations and investments, and enhanced measures of accountability”.
U of M Board of Regents Chair Sarah Hubbard, a Republican, defended the changes, posting on social media that the money being saved by ending its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives would instead be used “to support making Michigan more affordable for our students and families through expansion of the Go Blue Guarantee to family incomes of $125,000 or less and other student facing supports.” Hubbard insisted that “eliminating bureaucratic overspending” would  make U of M more accessible.
That was echoed by Regent Jordan Acker, a Democrat, who said the policy changes were “fundamentally about improving our diversity efforts to make them work better.”
Acker, who began voicing concerns over the university’s DEI programs last year, said the university had spent $250 million on diversity efforts in recent years, much of it to administrative overhead, while the population of minority students had seen little growth.
“At Michigan, the focus of our diversity efforts needs to be meaningful change, not bureaucracy,” he posted.
However, the decision has also drawn criticism, including from ACLU Michigan, which released a statement late Thursday condemning what it viewed as acquiescence to authoritarianism. 
“In a moment when we need leaders to be vigilant in defending our collective communities, it is extremely disappointing to see a public institution like the University of Michigan succumbing to authoritarian bullying of the Trump administration without a fight,” read the statement.
“While the University certainly did not make this decision lightly, many of our community institutions – such as our local libraries, schools and other institutions of higher education – are fighting to adhere to their values under enormous pressure, while one of our largest, most well-resourced institutions with a history and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, has capitulated,” it stated.
Rebekah Modrak, the chair of the university’s Faculty Senate and a professor at the Stamps School of Art, referred to the sweeping executive orders as “the power of the government to engineer a sweeping culture change towards white supremacy,” and said the university’s leadership “seem determined to comply and to collaborate in our own destruction.”
Modrak questioned what the ultimate outcome of this decision would be. 
“These missteps by our university will not end here; they will lead, as they have done in Texas and Ohio, to the censorship of course and program content,” she said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Two months into his second term, nearly 6 out of every 10 Rhode Islanders disapprove of Donald Trump’s performance as president, according to a new University of New Hampshire (UNH) poll.
The survey of 656 Rhode Islanders conducted online and by text message between March 20 and 24, found 40% approve of Trump’s performance so far, while 59% had negative views of his handling of foreign and domestic affairs.
UNH’s poll has a 3.8% margin of error. 
The top reason for disapproving of the president was concern that he is undermining democracy or the U.S. Constitution, cited by 21% of opponents. Among those who approve of Trump’s second term, 27% pointed to his handling of immigration as their main reason for support.
Trump’s unpopularity was weighed by overwhelming disapproval — 94% — from registered Democrats, who made up 53% of those surveyed. 
Democrats make up 36% of the electorate, according to data compiled by the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s office. Republicans make up 15% of the state’s registered voters. The biggest swath of voters — 49% — are unaffiliated with either party.
Rhode Islanders also disapproved of his handling of the economy, use of tariffs and the potential for a recession, along with his handling of the war in Ukraine.
On the economy, only one-third of Rhode Island residents polled by UNH approve of Trump’s use of tariﬀs. Nearly all Democrats — 93% — disapproved of the taxes placed on imports. Eighty percent of Rhode Island Republicans and half of Independents surveyed support the policy.
UNH’s poll also found that 61% of Rhode Islanders disavowed Trump’s handling of the war in Ukraine and the president’s assertions over who is responsible for the conflict. Trump has alluded to the idea that Ukraine started the war in 2022, but 78% of those polled believe that Russia is either entirely or mostly responsible.
A majority of Rhode Islanders do approve of one plank of Trump’s agenda: banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. The UNH poll found 65% of respondents believe transgender female athletes should “definitely not” be able to compete in contests with cis women.
Rhode Islanders are slightly more accepting of transgender athletes in men’s sports, with 56% of respondents believing they should not be allowed to compete.
Those surveyed were divided on who should set athletic policies, with 44% favoring a federal decision, 40% supporting state-level action, and the rest unsure.

(Photo by Getty Images)Starting on June 20, police in New Mexico will no longer have the authority to determine whether to issue a public alert for a missing person suffering from Alzheimer’s, dementia or other cognitive decline.
Instead, the decision to issue a “Silver Alert” will be up to whoever is reporting the person missing, and the missing person will not require a formal diagnosis, under a new state law signed on March 21 by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
House Bill 197, which expands the eligibility for local police departments or the New Mexico State Police to issue the alerts, received unanimous approval by all three legislative committees that heard it, along with both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Previously, state law excluded from Silver Alerts people with general cognitive decline or impairment, limiting their access to emergency response resources for missing people without a formal Alzheimer’s or dementia diagnosis.
Anastasia Martin, general counsel for the New Mexico Aging and Long Term Services Department, which houses the Adult Protective Services division, told the House Judiciary Committee on March 10 that her agency had “run into challenges with the current law in having silver alerts issued.”
HB197 co-sponsor Rep. Joseph Sanchez (D-Alcalde) told the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee on Feb. 13 that when a friend’s relative from Albuquerque went missing, the friend asked police to issue a Silver Alert but they would not “because the person wasn’t medically diagnosed with a cognitive issue like dementia or Alzheimer’s.”
HB197 relaxes the criteria for the alerts so that the reporting party only needs to indicate they believe the missing person shows signs or symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia, cognitive decline or impairment, regardless of age.
The law previously gave the police the final say on whether or not an alert was issued, based on whether they found “clear indication that the individual suffers from Alzheimer’s.”
Almost all people who have gone missing in the last three years were found after Silver Alerts were issued, according to data compiled by the New Mexico Department of Public Safety. DPS reported in its analysis of the bill that between 2022 and Jan. 31, 2025, nearly 95% of people who went missing were found after police issued a Silver Alert.
“The revised criteria may enhance the responsiveness of law enforcement agencies to missing persons cases involving cognitive decline,” the DPS analyst wrote. “This could lead to quicker recoveries, reducing risks to vulnerable individuals and improving public safety.”

Now, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to supercharge those efforts.
Trump in January issued an executive order directing several federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to tap into federal money for so-called school choice opportunities. Those can come in the form of education savings accounts, voucher programs, tax credits or scholarships. Trump’s order also aims to expand access to public charter schools, which are free from some of the rules that apply to traditional public schools.
Meanwhile in Congress, 24 Republican senators have signed on to legislation that would provide $10 billion in annual tax credits to individuals and corporations who make charitable contributions to organizations that provide private-school scholarships. A Nebraska Republican introduced a companion measure in the House.
Already this year, Idaho, Tennessee and Wyoming have approved school choice programs, and bills are advancing in Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. A bill in Mississippi died before advancing. Most of the measures still in play would open programs to all families regardless of income, though some states would cap the total amount of money available.
Supporters of school choice say it gives parents control of their kids’ education — and an escape hatch if they are dissatisfied with their local public school. Many conservatives, religious institutions and private schools are in favor of school choice, along with some people of color who live in districts with underperforming public schools.
“Every child is different. They learn in different environments. There are just so many factors, that I believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success,” said Indiana Republican state Sen. Linda Rogers. A former educator, Rogers has sponsored a bill in her state that would provide additional money to charter schools, which are considered to be a form of school choice.
Opponents, including teachers unions, public school professionals and many rural lawmakers of both parties, say such measures undermine traditional public schools by shifting money away from them.
“When we start to take from public schools, we’re hurting our kids, our lower-income kids. They will not prosper from this legislation,” Tennessee Democratic state Rep. Ronnie Glynn said during the floor debate on a far-reaching voucher bill in his state.
Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, said vouchers are a budget-buster for states.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Cowen said in a phone interview. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
The switch to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave parents a front-row seat to watch what their children were — or were not — learning in their classes, contributed to the recent school choice momentum. So did parent frustration over prolonged public school closures.
“Parents got a good look into sort of what was happening in schools,” said Bella DiMarco, a senior K-12 education policy analyst at FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University. “There was a lot of talk during the pandemic around school choice … of what public schools aren’t doing for their kids.”
The first modern school voucher program, created in Milwaukee in 1990, was a bipartisan effort to help lower-income families afford private schools. In recent years, more states have moved from school choice programs focused on certain groups, such as low-income students or students with disabilities, to universal programs open to students of all backgrounds.
“Historically, the programs were always sort of targeted to students in need,” DiMarco said. “But in the last couple of years, the new push has been for these universal programs.”
Currently, more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one school choice program. More than a dozen states now offer universal or near-universal access, allowing K–12 students to participate in school choice regardless of income.
EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice, estimates that 1.2 million students are attending private schools this school year with the help of public tax credits, scholarships or vouchers.
 Different strategies

States that enacted school choice programs this year have pursued different strategies.
The program Idaho enacted last month, for example, will provide an annual tax credit of $5,000 per child ($7,500 for students with disabilities) to help cover private education expenses.
Tennessee’s new program will provide 20,000 scholarships of roughly $7,000 each. During its first year, half of the Tennessee scholarships will be reserved for households earning less than $173,000 for a family of four, but that restriction will be removed in subsequent years.
About 65% of the Tennessee vouchers are expected to be awarded to students who already attend private schools, according to a legislative analysis.
Critics say the cost of the program will grow quickly, creating a hole in the state’s budget. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who pushed hard for the proposal, suggested that Trump’s executive order might provide additional resources. Lee told reporters he hasn’t yet analyzed the order, “but I think there’s opportunity there.”
“The president wants to support states like ours who are advocating for school choice,” Lee said in a news conference after lawmakers approved the measure. Lee was at the White House on Thursday when Trump signed an order calling for the U.S. Department of Education to be dismantled.
Texas lawmakers also are actively debating a voucher program, a longtime priority for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who worked to defeat resistant rural Republicans in last year’s state legislative elections and who also attended the White House event. The Senate passed a bill that would provide $10,000 per student ($11,500 for students with disabilities) annually through education savings accounts. A similar House proposal is under review.
Kansas is considering a universal refundable tax credit — $8,000 per child for accredited private school tuition and $4,000 for non-accredited private schools. The program starts with a $125 million cap, increasing annually if participation hits certain thresholds.
 Ballot box defeats

School choice opponents question the wisdom of sending taxpayer dollars to schools that may lack certified teachers, follow nonstandardized curricula or discriminate in admissions. Many private schools have testing standards, maintain religious requirements or exclude LGBTQ+ students or those with certain disabilities, for example.
In some Republican-led states that have expanded school choice, Democrats have filed bills to increase oversight and place restrictions on these programs. A bill in Tennessee would require background checks for teachers at private schools that receive voucher money. And an Iowa bill would require that property tax statements include information on how much money education savings accounts subtracted from local public schools.
As voucher programs have grown, they have attracted greater scrutiny.
ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet, last year found that Arizona’s universal voucher program has mostly benefited wealthier families. Some Arizona parents have tried to use voucher money to pay for dune buggies and expensive Lego sets, according to press reports.
Critics also note that despite recent legislative successes, school ballot initiatives fared poorly at the ballot box last fall.
Voters in Colorado rejected a measure that sought to enshrine school choice rights in the state constitution.
In Nebraska, voters partially repealed a state-funded private school scholarship program.
And in Kentucky, voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the use of public money to support private schools, with 65% of voters — and a majority in every county — opposed.
“There’s a handful of these billionaires that have been pushing vouchers for 30 years,” said Cowen, the Michigan State University professor. “The school choice movement is not necessarily driven by public demand, but rather by wealthy donors and political maneuvering.”

(Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)As Missouri lawmakers debate the $47.9 billion state budget, they are also deciding how to spend an unexpectedly large chunk of cash from sales taxes collected from marijuana dispensaries.
The nearly $86 million paid by recreational cannabis users is constitutionally required to be divided up evenly between funds benefiting veterans, public defenders and programs that prevent substance use disorders. 
“Due to a strong cannabis market and effective, efficient regulation of that market,” said Amy Moore, director of the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation told The Independent this week, “the funds available for the ultimate beneficiaries of the cannabis regulatory program continue to outpace expectations.”
In February, Moore told the House budget committee that each fund could receive $28.6 million in the various budget bills debated this spring.
So far, the full $28.6 million has made it into budget legislation for both veterans and substance use disorder programs. Part of it will help fund new partnerships with the state courts, public schools and other providers to support children’s mental health. 
The Missouri Veterans Commission will receive an additional $13 million from medical marijuana money as well, and its total $41.6 million will go towards the operational needs and potential repairs for the state’s seven veterans homes.
However, the House has approved only $15.3 million for the public defenders system so far.
State lawmakers have the authority to decide whether to withhold the money, even though they can’t spend it anywhere else. 
The public defender’s office, for example, had hoped to use some of the cannabis money to increase their attorneys’ starting pay from $65,000 per year to $70,000. That would align the salary with the attorney general’s office entry-level pay.
“There’s a huge cost to employee turnover,” said Mary Fox, director of the Office of Public Defender, during a budget committee hearing last month, “and where we see that employee turnover is in years one through three, which is why that is where I would like to bring them in line with the attorney general salary.”
  Mary Fox, left testifies alongside Annie Legomsky during a February hearing of the House Health and Mental Health Committee (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
That $2.5 million request was shot down in the House, despite the funds being available. During a budget committee hearing, she also asked for $4 million to hire 45 full-time social workers to expand the agency’s holistic defense program, which employs social workers to connect clients with community resources. 
For several years, the system suffered from having long waitlists to get legal representation, which resulted in a successful lawsuit against the state. 
State Rep. John Voss, a Republican from Cape Girardeau and a budget committee member, pushed to add $1.6 million for pay raises and $1.2 million to hire 20 social workers.
The $1.2 million was added, but the pay raises were not.
“These attorneys represent the poor in our state, and they deserve the best representation that we can provide to them,” said Voss, during a budget committee meeting last month. “In terms of the holistic defense mitigation specialists, I believe that we’re actually investing in ways to prevent people from becoming incarcerated again, and we will wind up saving money across the entire state budget.”
Overall, Voss said part of the reason the public defenders’ total allocation is less than the two other funds is because about $11.7 million was included in budget legislation that required the funds to be spent by June — and the public defenders weren’t poised to do that. 
That money goes back to a fund in the Missouri Treasury to be appropriated to the public defenders in pending legislation, Senate Committee on Appropriations Chair Lincoln Hough told Independent last month.
“The money isn’t reallocated,” he said. “It stays dedicated to the public defender. The money is still sitting there and will be allocated in the operating bills.”
After the House votes to approve the bills, likely next week, Hough’s committee will debate them. While the House may not have included the public defenders’ requests for salary raises, the Senate has the ability to add more money back in before May. 
“The public defender will be taken care of in the operating bills,” Hough said. “It generally takes right up until the constitutional deadline to get these things done. And so we’ll have plenty of discussion on this.”

But despite those efforts in places like Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, the movement largely bypassed Florida, despite the best intentions by lawmakers like former Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes.
That mood has changed in recent years, however.
Homicides increased coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic and crime was a major issue in Donald Trump’s successful reelection campaign. Nevertheless, Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart is continuing her fight for reform of Florida’s prison system — a crusade she’s been on since being elected in 2018.
Joined by two fellow Democrats, family members of the incarcerated, and a former corrections worker, Hart led a press conference on the fourth floor Rotunda in the Capitol earlier this week to discuss her inmates’ “bill of rights” legislation (HB 185), which she has filed for the past five years in the Florida House.
The legislation calls for each inmate in the Florida correctional system to be provided a written copy of their rights, including:

Proper ventilation — either through an air-conditioning system or “exhaust and air circulators sufficient to provide a safe and healthful environment for inmates.”
Sufficient meal time.
Adequate food supply in case of an emergency.
Health supplies such as PPE and products like sanitary napkins, soap, tampons, and toothpaste.

The legislation says an inmate could file a grievance with the Department of Corrections if he or she believes a right guaranteed is denied by prison officials.
At the press conference, Hart expressed her dissatisfaction with the quality of health care in the prison system, and despaired that the last public data available from the Department of Corrections came in 2019.
She said that’s a violation of state law, which requires the department report “not less than annually” to the governor and Legislature about the Department of Corrections’ health care delivery system.
“Citizens and elected officials like myself are given the run-around when we attempt to see the latest numbers or ask simple questions regarding the state of our prison system and our loved ones,” she said, adding, “Florida is the Sunshine State, yet the truth of our government is shrouded in darkness.”
The Florida Department of Corrections did not immediately return a request for comment.
Broward County Democrat Mike Gottlieb is a co-sponsor on Hart’s bill. A criminal defense attorney for more than three decades, he said that prisoners are human beings and deserve human rights.
“Being incarcerated is a punishment, but it should not mean a loss of dignity, safety, or access to essentials like food, health care, or humane living conditions, such as air conditioning,” he said.
“Denying prisoners their rights does not make society safer. It makes us less just. When we mistreat those of our prisoners, we create the cycle of violence and dehumanization that extends beyond the prison walls. Studies have shown that humane treatment leads to lower recidivism rates, helping prisoners reintegrate into society as productive members, rather than returning to crime.”
The Senate version (SB 358) of Hart’s legislation is being sponsored by Broward County Democrat Rosalind Osgood.
 “Once the state of Florida takes possession of a person as an inmate, we have a responsibility,” she said. “When we take away somebody’s freedom because we’re holding them accountable for committing a crime, it doesn’t mean that gives us the opportunity to strip them of their dignity. A just society doesn’t abandon people once they’re behind bars.”
Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Ricky Dixon said in October 2023 that 75% of all housing units in Florida’s corrections system lack air-conditioning. A detailed report from the global consulting firm KPMG estimated that it would cost somewhere between $6 million and nearly $12 billion to repair buildings and construct new facilities, with hundreds of millions more needed to pay for staffing.
While many of Hart’s proposals to reform Florida’s prisons system haven’t reached fruition during her tenure in the House, a bill she is sponsoring this year that would allow more of the approximately 3,000 inmates who are eligible for parole to have a better chance of being released was passed in a House committee on Wednesday.
Florida eliminated parole for most inmates in the early 1980s, making most of the 88,000 prisoners in the corrections system ineligible. Another legislative proposal filed this year by Orange County Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (SB 1786) would expand the pool of inmates still eligible for parole. That measure has not been heard in any committee so far this session.
The issue of how criminal justice reform lost clout with conservatives in recent years was reflected during the race for the Republican nomination for president in 2023. That’s when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis attacked Trump for supporting the First Step Act — although DeSantis supported it initially when he served in Congress.
