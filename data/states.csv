BURLINGTON — Vermont’s dirt roads span 8,534 miles — more than the straight-line distance between Burlington and San Francisco three times over. They contribute to the state’s rustic charm, bring tourists looking for gravel biking and are beloved by rural residents.
They are also particularly vulnerable to floods. 
Runoff from any type of road can harm water quality, but Vermont has some 1,300 more miles of dirt than pavement — and that dirt is subject to easy erosion. 
With the state experiencing an increase in flooding, those old roads are hitting waterways and their ecosystems hard. 
And the state is pretty much stuck with them. “Putting in paved roads is very expensive, and we just don’t have that kind of funding in Vermont to want to do that,” said Jim Ryan, former manager of the Vermont Municipal Roads Program with the Department of Environmental Conservation.
But there are ways to improve those roads that reduce pollution and strengthen against floods. 
Like paved roads, dirt roads are essentially impervious, meaning they do not absorb water, said Beverly Wemple, a University of Vermont professor who helps lead the college’s Water Resources Institute. When it rains, water washes across those surfaces, eroding sediment and running into ditches or bodies of water.
Phosphorus likes to bind to sediment, meaning it gets swept away too. In excess, it fuels harmful algae blooms — as is the case in Lake Champlain, where runoff has deposited high levels of the nutrient. Large sections of the lake are on the federal impaired waterways list.
Phosphorus aside, those sediments can hurt aquatic ecosystems where plants and animals struggle to survive in water choked with dirt and debris. 
Wemple’s research helped bring attention to dirt road runoff at a time when Vermont was focusing more and more on water quality. 
A 2008 lawsuit alleging poor pollution control forced federal and state officials to revise plans for Lake Champlain. State lawmakers passed the Vermont Clean Water Act in 2015, anticipating stricter standards. Those came a year later when federal officials tightened limits on phosphorus in the lake. 
People wanted a better understanding of where the phosphorus was coming from.
Funded by the Lake Champlain Basin Program, Wemple studied the impact of Vermont’s transportation network on water quality.
Tropical Storm Irene hit while research was underway, allowing Wemple’s team to also see what happens to Vermont’s roads when they flood, she said. 
The study, released in 2013, proved erosion from dirt roads was a significant source of sediment in waterways — and confirmed phosphorus attached to the sediment was polluting Lake Champlain. It also included research on ways to keep water off roads and reduce runoff.
“That research essentially gave us the first piece … of scientific evidence of the importance of our road network as a source of pollutant transfer but also of the potential for some fairly straightforward practices to minimize that pollutant runoff,” Wemple said. 
After the new phosphorus regulations, the state created a permit program that set road standards for towns. It aimed to reduce erosion contributing to phosphorus pollution. The Department of Environmental Conservation and Agency of Transportation run the program. 
Towns must record the condition of their roads and key characteristics — such as whether they connect to water and whether they use storm drains, or ditches and culverts, for drainage. Over half the roads in Vermont connect to waterways, the state says.
The Agency of Natural Resources says open-drainage roads — those with culverts and ditches — are often gravel and produce the most phosphorus. Those roads are where the bulk of the standards are applied.
Towns must upgrade roads not up to code. For a dirt road, this usually means improving drainage: lining ditches with stones and vegetation to filter out sediment.
There are also improvements to the road itself. Crowning a road, or lowering the sides so the high point is in the middle, helps it shed water, as does removing berms and ruts that trap water. Another element: properly sizing culverts, the tunnels that allow water to pass underneath roads. 
“We were able to document that many of these practices are quite effective in both reducing erosion and making the transportation network more flood resilient,” said Wemple. 
Through the Agency of Transportation’s Better Roads Program, towns can apply for grants to cover projects.
Making improvements also helps protect from floods, said Ryan. Working as a deputy stream engineer in the aftermath of Irene, and doing “flood forensics” after the 2023 floods, he found that up-to-standard roads came away in better shape.
Where there was damage, the culprit was most frequently culvert size, he said. Often the issue stemmed from small culverts under driveways or over intermittent streams. In heavy rain, culverts have to handle more water than usual. If they’re too small, they flood or get blocked by debris, leading to a domino effect where one failed culvert takes out several others down the road, Ryan said.
Municipalities are slowly updating their roads. Ryan said Vermont towns have an average of 25 miles of roads running directly into waterways and are upgrading about a mile a year.  
Flood resilience can get a boost right away, but maintenance is ongoing. 
“There’s no finish line there. The road grader always has to go out and put a proper crown on the road, remove the grader berm, lower the road’s shoulders and clean out the ditches,” Ryan said.
His observations are set to be tested: Wemple just began a two-year study on the impact of the road permit program on flood resilience in 2023 and 2024.
“We hear anecdotally … that it looks like places where we’ve upgraded the storm water infrastructure on roads, there were fewer damages,” she said. “But we don’t have the scientific evidence to back that up yet.” 
Wemple said people often ask, Should we just pave the roads?
One factor is uncertainty about which is worse for water quality. Wemple said there’s not much difference between paved and unpaved.
But there’s also what she called “the societal question.”
“Many of us in Vermont are quite attached to our rural landscapes and those unpaved roads,” she said. “And if we paved them, people would drive a lot faster. And we’d lose some of that rural ideal that we are really attached to.” 
Eric Barker lives on a dirt road in Underhill close to where he grew up. When he chose where to raise his family, a dirt road was a priority. 
“I don’t even think we looked at a single lot on pavement,” he said.
His driveway requires a lot of care, and his car has gotten stuck in the mud at inopportune times, but he said it’s worth it.
“I think you have to have the right vehicles, and I think you have to have the right mentality,” he said. He values the privacy his home allows for his family — and the sparse traffic. 
Dirt roads also draw tourism. Waterford resident Fritz Fay is president of Northeast Kingdom Gravel. The organization’s mission is to bring dollars to the Kingdom by mapping gravel biking routes and attracting tourists. 
The sport has exploded in recent years — and Fay said Vermont, with its sprawl of dirt roads, is ready made for it.
Big events and concentrated trails can overwhelm small towns, and locals often resent that, Fay said, but gravel biking is gentler. 
The NEK has witnessed that scenario in East Burke with the popular Kingdom Trails. Gravel biking brings in a few people at a time across multiple towns, Fay said. 
“It’s scattered, and that’s an advantage,” he said. 
The benefits go beyond drawing cyclists, though.
“If all these roads were paved, it’d be one less kind of unique thing to come to Vermont (for),” he said.

The historic home of Vermont’s oldest professional theater company rebounded after a 1962 fire and 2011’s Tropical Storm Irene, only to now face questions in the wake of a 2023 soaking.

WESTON — When the Weston Theater Company announced its musical now playing would be a stage adaptation of the 1954 film “White Christmas,” some locals wondered about the seeming incongruity of orchestrating summer with sleigh bells in the snow.
More residents, however, are worried about an even bigger toppling of tradition.
Upon its start in 1937, Vermont’s oldest professional acting troupe performed in a white-pillared playhouse on the postcard green of its namesake Windsor County town of 623 residents.
In 1962, a fire ravaged everything but the building’s Doric columns. In 1973 and 2011, storm overflow from the neighboring West River flooded the cellar of the restored structure. But come hell or high water, the company always reopened in keeping with the theatrical credo “the show must go on.”
Then on July 10, 2023, a record downpour swallowed up the playhouse’s basement and first floor. The troupe relocated to a smaller second stage at the nearby Walker Farm with hopes of bailing out the main theater in time for that summer’s musical — fatefully, the splashy “Singin’ in the Rain.”
But two years later, the playhouse sits empty as its nonprofit operators wrestle with questions about finances and the future.
“Our estimate right now is we’re three years out from getting back into the building, and when I tell people that, they’re shocked,” said Susanna Gellert, the theater company’s executive artistic director. “They think, ‘Why can’t we be back in tomorrow?’”

The answer, according to all involved, is almost as complicated as the bureaucratic paperwork they’re swimming in.
The theater company doesn’t own the playhouse, which was built as a church in 1839. Instead, the troupe leases it from the Weston Community Association, a volunteer-run nonprofit that also oversees the nearby 1795 Farrar-Mansur House museum and Cold Spring Brook Park.
In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene washed away a $700,000 renovation of the playhouse’s dressing rooms, prop shop and orchestra pit. Twelve years later, the 2023 floodwater rose about 30 inches higher, swelling cleanup costs to nearly $500,000 and the proposed reconstruction to as much as $5 million.
Both the community association and theater company are seeking damage reimbursements from insurance carriers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They’re also planning separate fundraising campaigns to pay for their parts of a shared restoration project.
But the state fire marshal has closed the playhouse to the public until the community association replaces the alarm and sprinkler system — a nearly $200,000 expense that volunteers have yet to figure out how to fund.
“A lot of the people we know who are capable of writing a big check are reluctant to do so until all of the building mitigation has been done,” community association President David Raymond said. “It’s a Catch-22 situation.”

The community association and theater company are not giving up. They recently welcomed U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, to tell him about the cleanup challenges shared by dozens of communities statewide.
“When you look at this town at the helicopter level, we’ve got probably $12 million to $15 million worth of capital needs in the playhouse, fire station, post office, school,” Weston Town Moderator Wayne Granquist said. “That’s incredibly far beyond our capacity to raise money. We need to have external help.”
Welch didn’t promise federal funds, just words of understanding.
“The Weston Playhouse is such a community resource,” the senator said.
Planners are aiming to move all of the playhouse’s electrical and mechanical systems and backstage and storage space above the most recent flood line.
“It’s going to be a push to get the building sustainable, and then a push to get it functional again,” said Rebecca Marzalek-Kelly, the theater company’s general manager.
In the meantime, the theater company is presenting its 89th summer season at its nearby Walker Farm performance space.
“We’re doing what work we can right now so that we’re ready to get back into the playhouse once it’s ready,” Gellert said. “But all of that starts with funding.”
Raymond, for his part, knows the playhouse may be within walking distance of everything in town, but he and his community association colleagues have a long road ahead.
“Hope,” Raymond said when asked what kept him going. “And patience.”

U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The race to replace Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is crowded on both sides.
Whitmer, a Democrat and potential 2028 presidential contender, is term-limited. The current Democratic primary contenders are Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist; Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson; Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson; and Marni Sawicki, the former mayor of Cape Coral, Florida. If elected, Gilchrist would be the state’s first Black governor.
The crowded Republican field includes Rep. John James, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox and Anthony Hudson, a truck driver who ran for Congress in Michigan’s 8th District in 2024.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, is also running for governor but as an independent candidate, potentially throwing a wrench into the dynamics of what is expected to be one of the closest and most competitive 2026 governor’s races.
Michigan has long been a key swing state — and a pipeline for women leaders — where control of the governor’s office has switched between Democratic and Republican over the last 40 years. Former President Joe Biden won the state by 2.8 points in 2020. In 2024, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin won her election to the U.S. Senate by just 0.3 points while President Donald Trump carried the state by 1.4 points.
In all, 36 governorships are up in 2026. Five Democratic-led states won by Trump in 2024 (Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) are holding elections for governor in 2026, while two Republican governors in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris (New Hampshire and Vermont) are up for reelection.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3115471-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-03 06:56:17.412214

(Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Daniel Cressy yawned, tired after three days of watching a machine pull blood out of his body, extract his stem cells and pump the blood back in. Tubes protruded from the side of his neck, preventing him from turning his head. He gestured toward them while sitting in his hospital bed at the Manning Family Children’s Hospital.
“It’s uncomfortable at first, but then you kind of get used to it,” he said Wednesday.
The tubes were annoying, but, to Cressy, the reward is more than worth the discomfort: freedom from sickle cell disease. This procedure marked the first major step toward what he hopes is a long-lasting cure for the rare genetic blood disorder.
Over the next year and a half, Cressy’s genes will be altered to remove the trait that causes his red blood cells to sickle, or harden and bend in a way that blocks blood flow and causes immense pain. He will be the first patient in Louisiana to complete the gene therapy treatment.
The 22-year-old’s stem cells will be sent to a lab in Scotland where they will be treated with an enzyme to reach a specific part of the cells and edit the gene to stop his blood cells from changing shape. Then, Cressy’s edited stem cells will be returned to Louisiana and infused back into his body. More than 90% of the patients in a clinical trial who received this treatment known as Casgevy, went at least a year without sickled cells blocking blood flow.

The process is long and expensive. Between insurance approvals, paperwork and preliminary doctor appointments, it took Cressy nearly a year to get to this room. But, for Cressy, it’s the only way to achieve his dream of becoming a commercial pilot.
Three years ago, Cressy discovered his love of flying, but after hours of lessons, working toward his certification, he was told his dream might be impossible. People with sickle cell disease seeking a pilot’s license face scrutiny over their health backgrounds from the Federal Aviation Administration.
High altitudes can make cells more likely to sickle, creating the risk of intense pain while in the air if there isn’t enough oxygen.
“The Office of Aerospace Medicine routinely reviews evolving medical therapies and updates policies when there is proof that new treatments are safe in the aviation environment,” said an FAA spokesperson in a statement.
Cressy applied for his medical certification in 2022 but was rejected despite several appeals. To Cressy, his condition was manageable. Unlike many people with severe cases of sickle cell disease, he hasn’t needed frequent hospital visits and blood transfusions to avoid pain.
“One thing that people don’t understand is that sickle cell affects everybody differently,” he said. “I believed that I could fly without getting cured.” But the FAA disagreed.
When Cressy first asked for the treatment, his hematologist, Dr. Zach LeBlanc, said no. To LeBlanc, a career in aviation didn’t seem like a top medical priority. But Cressy’s passion – and an official rejection from the FAA – changed LeBlanc’s mind.
“The more I got to know him, I understood that it wasn’t as superficial as it appeared the first time,” said LeBlanc, a pediatric hematologist with the hospital who was part of clinical trials to develop another long-term sickle cell cure. “He was really serious about this, and he understood the risk.”

Traditionally, bone marrow transplants have been the primary way to provide long-lasting relief, but patients have to fit specific criteria and find an unrelated donor with a close genetic match. The right bone marrow donor is hard to find, and Cressy didn’t have many options for a cure until two gene therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2023. Children’s Hospital is the first in the state to be approved to administer the treatments.
Cressy and LeBlanc hope other sickle cell patients will soon receive better care.  The Louisiana Department of Health recently estimated that at least 3,000 people in the state have been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.
The disorder occurs mostly in Black people like Cressy. It’s caused by a genetic mutation that evolved and spread across much of Africa as a response to malaria. People who only have one sickle cell gene are at least 90% more resistant to malaria, but if a person inherits two sickle cell genes, they will develop the painful disorder.
Many health care providers and researchers, including LeBlanc, now acknowledge how the medical community has historically neglected and stigmatized patients with the disorder. But LeBlanc believes, especially with the addition of new treatments at Children’s Hospital, that such care is starting to improve.
“Sickle cell disease in the state of Louisiana is hopefully in a time where it can really change,” he said.
There are still vast areas in rural parts of the state where basic care for sickle cell isn’t available, especially for adults, but there’s been an uptick in attention, he said.
Advocates for people living with the disorder say that attention is much needed. Courtney Davis is the deputy executive director of the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana. He said the state legislature has begun to pay more attention to the disorder, forming a commission and starting a registry to monitor the prevalence of the condition in 2021.
“There’s a lack of knowledge about sickle cell,” said Davis, who is also living with sickle cell disease. “We’re always trying to garner more support for sickle cell all over the state.”
Compared to other rare disorders like cystic fibrosis, there’s a large disparity in both public and private funding for sickle cell treatments and cures, researchers have found. Disparities in health care for Black Americans also affect how patients are treated.

Rhonda Chube, a community health worker with the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana, said her clients often face stigma when trying to receive care. They struggle to get hospitals and employers to understand the severity of their pain, she said.
“They may look okay physically, but what’s going on inside their body is where the problem is,” she said.
The condition also comes with financial burden due to hospitalizations, transfusions and regular doctor appointments. Chube and Davis said it’s nearly impossible to survive the disorder  without insurance.

(Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)
Many patients also need insurance in order to afford a curative treatment like Cressy’s. The medication alone costs $2 to $3 million. The stem cell collection and infusion, among other doctor visits, add another few hundred thousand dollars.
Lynn Winfield, Manning Family Children’s Hospital’s senior director of patient care services, said it can take more than a year for private insurance providers to approve reimbursement for the procedures. Without that guarantee, neither the patient nor medical providers can afford the treatment. Medicaid recipients are easier to get approved, but Winfield said she worried that could change with recent federal cuts to funding.
Winfield said the hospital is already lining up more patients, including a boy from Shreveport.
Cressy hopes he is only the beginning. He plans to advocate for more people with sickle cell as he goes through treatment and is excited to eventually become one of the first commercial pilots with the disorder. Cressy will be following in the footsteps of a friend with sickle cell who participated in a gene therapy clinical trial in Atlanta two years ago. They met through a Reddit post, bonding over experiencing the same roadblock to aviation. That friend, Cressy said, has since received a pilot’s license.

“Becoming aviators with sickle cell was once something that people thought was impossible,” he said from his hospital bed, wearing a Mr. Impossible t-shirt that he created. “My buddy has already proved to the world that it’s not. Nothing is impossible.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Less than a month after I moved to Durham for graduate school, Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Helene, the deadliest storm to ever hit the state, took 108 lives and caused an estimated $48.8 billion in damage. Less than a year later, Tropical Storm Chantal killed six North Carolinians and did more than $56 million in damage to Orange County. This is just one of the 13 counties for which Governor Stein declared a state of emergency. The physical and emotional trauma being felt during this time reminds me of watching my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana struggle to overcome tragic extreme weather events.
As a Gulf Coast native, I’ve felt the presence of natural disasters my entire life. When I was three, I evacuated New Orleans with my mother and younger sister ahead of Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke, my dad watched the water rise up, filling our street and submerging our front lawn, creeping up the steps to the top lip of our front porch. We were lucky the water began to drain before it could make it into the house.
As I grew older, I felt Katrina’s legacy in New Orleans. Many people were not as fortunate as my family – some lost their homes and others their lives. Some who made it out during evacuations or in the storm’s aftermath never returned to New Orleans. I worry for my family that still lives there.
Throughout my childhood and adolescence, we experienced other large storms. None were as seriously damaging as Katrina, but it was common to wake up to felled tree branches and flooded streets. In 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida whipped through New Orleans, leaving the city without power for over three weeks at the hottest time of the year. Unfortunately, such extreme weather experiences were not limited to my time in New Orleans.
The morning after Chantal hit Durham, my coworkers and I watched live news reports of the 130 casualties caused by flash flooding in Texas. Twenty-seven young girls were killed by the floods while attending a sleepaway camp similar to the one I attended for seven summers.
While watching these reports in shock and horror, I listened to people calling the disaster an unavoidable “act of God.” Of course, we should dedicate thoughts and prayers to the families suffering during this tragedy, but the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather is not random. It is directly attributable to human-induced climate change. To prevent future tragedies, we need accurate forecasts and warnings, timely federal relief programs, more resilient infrastructure, and climate action plans.
It is mystifying to me that the president claimed that he is investing in technology to protect people from extreme weather events on the same weekend he slashed support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and renewable energy. We need to be proactive, not reactive, and that means investing in climate adaptation.
Devastating extreme weather events are our new reality, no matter what state you live in. If it’s not a hurricane, it’ll be a tornado like the one that hit St. Louis in May of this year. Or wildfires like those that burned through Los Angeles in January. Or an extreme heat wave like the heat dome that is triggering heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida this past week.
As someone just starting to establish a career and life as a young professional, I fear the upcoming years during which extreme weather will become an even more powerful and disastrous force. Flooding from Chantal in Durham wiped out an entire suspension bridge in the Eno River State Park, where I frequently hike and recreate with friends. This is reality for my lifetime, and I want to do something about it.
We need to get serious about climate action. Without concerted environmental efforts, communities will continue to suffer, and people will needlessly die. We need to make our voices heard.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182574-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-03 06:56:17.412214

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Nevada has had either the highest or one of the highest unemployment rates in the U.S. over most of the 21st century. In the latest report Nevada has the nation’s second highest jobless rate, behind only the Musk-ravaged District of Columbia.
Occasionally Nevada’s notoriously persistent high unemployment rate is attributed to almost optimistic factors, like an economy in transition that is diversifying away from service sector jobs.
But for all the state tax breaks ladled to pretty much any expanding or relocating company that asks for one, before Trump killed it earlier this year Canadian tourism still supported more jobs in Southern Nevada than manufacturing does. Statewide, manufacturing only accounts for less than 4% of the state’s total employment. Nevada remains primarily a service sector economy with a service sector workforce.
From 9-11 to the Great Recession to the pandemic and now the tariff chaos, every time Nevada’s service economy starts to emerge from a crisis, it gets hammered by another one. (And through it all, the state’s primary industry has taken advantage of the carnage to trim its workforce. In the summer of 2000, 210,000 people were employed in Nevada’s casino hotels; in June of this year, 157,000 were.)
Trump threw one of his trademark Queen of Hearts “off with her head” tantrums Friday and fired U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, because Friday’s BLS jobs report indicated the Trump economy hasn’t been creating anywhere near as many jobs as were being created nearly every month during the Biden years.
Trump insists on government employees who are more dedicated to toadying up to him than faithfully executing the legitimate duties required in their jobs.
So now presumably monthly jobs reports won’t be determined by the Current Employment Statistics survey of more than 100,000 private and public employers, along with analysis and modeling of additional tools used by the BLS. Instead, official employment statistics will be corruptly determined by whatever numbers Trump jots on a poster board with his beloved Sharpie.
Which brings us back to Nevada’s unemployment rate.
Monthly state unemployment rates basically mirror those reported by the BLS. So with Trump now insisting that federal employment data must reflect positively on him, it’s possible Nevada’s official unemployment rate could drop substantially. Not because of an improving Nevada economy, or because fewer people are unemployed, but because of the aforementioned Sharpie.
There are at least two scenarios by which Nevada’s unemployment rate could officially (but not really) drop.
First, Trump could take a break from his busy schedule of tariff madness, Texas gerrymandering, and Epstein nostalgia and notice that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo is on the ballot next year. Trump could order his loyalists installed in the BLS to start lowering Nevada’s unemployment rate month by month. Then, when Democrats point out Lombardo has no economic policy to speak of, Campaign Joe could cite official data indicating the unemployment rate is dropping thanks to his economic mad skills.
Or, echoing his tariff-setting methodology, Trump could just pronounce arbitrary unemployment rates depending on how he feels about some state or other that day.
California? Ewww, a 9% unemployment rate because Gavin Newscum and woke, so Californians need to elect Republicans, Sharpie says.
Nevada? Oh, perhaps a little below the national average, just like Lombardo’s net approval rating. At least until the election. After that, it depends. If Lombardo remains governor and very nicely and publicly proclaims that his reelection was only possible thanks to Trump’s benevolent magnificence, Sharpie will say Nevada’s unemployment is super low. If Lombardo loses, only California’s is higher, or something along those lines.
“When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science,” reads a statement on Trump firing the BLS commissioner issued by a group led by the person Trump named to head the BLS during his first term.
Destroying public trust? Nothing is more dear to Trump’s heart. (See: Democracy and elections, Trump’s undermining of and assaults on.)
“Policymakers themselves are induced to undertake mistaken interventions in the economy if the data upon which decisions are taken is incorrect,” write the authors of a 2024 academic article on governments manipulating economic statistics.
Hmm, guess that’s one way to get the Fed to lower interest rates — trick it with bogus data. What could possibly go wrong?
Closer to home, imagine Nevada’s budget forecasters trying to determine how much money the state can budget for education, public safety, Medicaid and all the other state programs and services if official economic data isn’t worth the poster board it was scribbled on.
Business and industry and banks and investors of course rely on government economic data when making all manner of decisions, so it would be in their interest to see credible research instead of Sharpie jottings. But U.S. corporate and financial powers have been brought to heel, and dare not say a discouraging word, lest Trump unconstitutionally crush them while the U.S. Supreme Court aggressively looks the other way.
“When I become president, it will mark the end of credible, reliable government data, which will be terrible for many, many households, and the history of economic disturbances in this century suggest the effects will be even more damaging in long-struggling Nevada” is not a promise Trump made while campaigning last year.
But if he had, he’d be on his way to keeping it.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

Advocates say they save lives. Others say they encourage drug use.,"In late May, a group of people who had lost friends and family to drug overdoses gathered behind the velvet ropes just outside the House chamber at the state Capitol. 
Many of them had come to this building time and again to tell their stories to lawmakers, reliving painful memories of some of the worst moments of their lives. 
But on this day, they’d come full of hope: it was the final stretch of the 2025 legislative session, and they wanted to make one last push for passage of a landmark bill establishing Connecticut’s first overdose prevention centers. 
As the day unfolded, though, it became apparent that the bill faced a major roadblock: Gov. Ned Lamont. 
“‘We’re hearing that the governor’s threatening a veto,’” Diane Santos recalled another advocate telling her when she arrived at the Capitol. “I still didn’t fully grasp that it was going to play out the way that it was.”

Santos, who lost her 26-year-old son, Mark Collins, to an overdose in 2023, had spent the weekend emailing state representatives and had received encouraging responses. The measure was tucked into a bigger public health bill, and the odds of passage looked good, she thought. Another advocate had even spoken to Lamont by phone and came away feeling confident in his support. 
But now the word was out that Lamont would veto the broader bill if it included the overdose prevention center.
The provision would have made Connecticut one of the only states in the country to have an overdose prevention center, or OPC, a space equipped with supplies to mitigate the dangers of drug use that would allow people to bring illegal drugs and use them under the supervision of trained staff, equipped with supplies, like Narcan, that can prevent and reverse overdoses.
The concept, though relatively new in the United States, had won approval in the Connecticut Senate, and advocates expected the House to follow suit. They anticipated that Lamont would then sign the bill into law, and that, in time, the new center would join OPCs in states like New York and Rhode Island as a lifesaving instrument in the fight against drug overdoses. 
Last year in Connecticut, just shy of 1,000 people died of an overdose, down 35% from a peak of 1,530 in 2021, according to data from the Department of Public Health. Despite the unprecedented drop in deaths in both the state and country over the past couple of years, overdose remains the leading cause of death for American adults under 45. 
Supporters of overdose prevention centers — also known as supervised consumption or safe injection sites — say they are a crucial part of the fight to save lives, one that has for too long been avoided in the U.S. out of stigma and fear. With the availability of naloxone, the overdose reversal drug, saving lives is relatively straightforward as long as people don’t use drugs alone. Therefore, advocates say, the argument in favor of OPCs comes down to a simple truth: no one can recover from substance abuse disorder if they are dead. 
Skeptics question the legality of the centers and whether they encourage people to continue using instead of seeking treatment. Some also worry about their impact on the neighborhoods where they are placed. 
Evidence from around the world indicates that no one has ever died of a drug overdose at an OPC and that the facilities reduce public drug use and decrease demand on local emergency services without increasing crime. But accounts from advocates and community leaders in Rhode Island, New York City and Canada show that, even with evidence, it can take time to build approval among a public that isn’t familiar with the concept.

Lamont: “Wait and see” 
That afternoon at the Capitol, despite reports of the governor’s disapproval, Santos and other advocates kept on talking to legislators, hoping through some political maneuvering that their key issue would prevail.
But behind closed doors, the measure appeared doomed. The governor’s staff told House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, that Lamont would veto the bill if it included OPCs. In an effort to save the rest of the sprawling legislation, which tackled issues from fluoride in drinking water to pancreatic cancer screening, lawmakers sacrificed the OPC measure.
“Just complete disappointment,” Santos said of the result. “Just heartache and heartbreak and feeling like I was letting my son down all over again.”
In an interview with The Connecticut Mirror in July, Lamont said he had wanted more time to consider results from other states and see whether the facilities draw the ire of the Trump administration. 
“I think I said I’d have to take a look at it, but I’d be pretty reluctant to do it. I think it’s pretty early,” Lamont said. “I think Rhode Island really hadn’t gotten going yet. New York was going. Donald Trump was in office. He was coming down pretty hard.”
Plus, he said, Connecticut already uses nearly every tool at its disposal to combat the overdose crisis, including four harm reduction sites, with a fifth slated to open in Bridgeport, where people can get wound care, clean syringes, connection to counseling or just a cup of coffee.
“We have harm reduction sites already,” Lamont said. “We do everything in terms of Narcan and prevention and counseling and clean needles and such. We do everything except for the drug injection. And I just figured it was worth a little more wait-and-see.”
Lamont referenced a few conversations with individuals skeptical of the sites or their impact but said he hadn’t been on the receiving end of any significant opposition to the idea, either.
The legality of overdose prevention centers is itself controversial. Some question whether the centers violate the federal Controlled Substances Act, which prohibits maintaining a site “for the purpose of … using illegal drugs.” Others argue the law doesn’t apply to public health programs meant to prevent death. The sites in New York City and Providence have been able to operate mostly unbothered, but a 2019 Department of Justice lawsuit prevented the opening of an OPC in Philadelphia. 
An executive order issued by the Trump administration last month directed agencies to withhold discretionary grants from organizations like “safe consumption sites” that allow for illicit drug use.
Lamont did, however, suggest a willingness to consider the policy.
“It’s not something we’re saying ‘hell no’ to,” Lamont said. “Let’s just get a little more experience based on Rhode Island and perhaps a couple other states.” 
But the wait-and-see approach has enraged some advocates who say that people are dying now — advocates like Dita Bhargava of Greenwich, whose son died of an overdose in 2018. 
“I know the governor. I know he has a compassionate heart. But at the end of the day, I think, unfortunately, he doesn’t understand the disease. He doesn’t understand the gravity of this epidemic. Lives that can be saved are being lost.”

Other states are also taking it slow 
Lamont isn’t the only state leader taking a cautious approach, however. In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure in California that would have allowed an “unlimited number” of sites, though he said he remained open to discussing a “truly limited pilot program.” Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont vetoed an OPC bill in 2022 and again in 2024, but, the second time around, lawmakers overrode his veto. 
In 2023, Connecticut’s Public Health Committee introduced a bill to establish three “harm reduction centers” that would include, among other services, a space where people could bring drugs to use under supervision. But legislators removed on-site drug use from the version that went to the broader legislature out of concerns from the administration about the use of state funding and conflicts with federal law, according to Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, the co-chair of the Public Health Committee.
This year’s effort would have established a pilot program of four OPCs without tapping state funding. The centers would include access to substance use disorder and mental health counseling, laundry, bathrooms and showers. The Public Health Committee passed the measure as a stand-alone bill, and the Senate cleared it as part of a sprawling public health bill.
Republican lawmakers on the committee, who nearly unanimously voted against the measure, voiced concern about the centers’ effects on surrounding communities and questioned whether they encourage drug use instead of treatment. 
During an eight-hour public hearing, advocates presented personal stories and real-world evidence, including studies suggesting the facilities prevent overdose deaths for clients, increase uptake of treatment services, reduce emergency-related health care costs and reduce public drug use and publicly discarded drug paraphernalia, without increasing crime rates in the surrounding areas.

Cameron Breen helps to coordinate the Statewide Harm Reduction Project, or SHaRP, a group of more than 100 overdose prevention advocates from around the state. He said the focus on abstinence-only solutions can be frustrating. 
“People think that the only truly successful intervention is the person stopping to use drugs altogether,” he said. “The reality is that substance use exists and too many of our community members are dying.”
But Breen agreed there’s room to increase community outreach in the future.
“Without it, we’re left in this limbo of people not having a good understanding of how much these centers save lives,” Breen said.
Rep. Tracy Marra, a Darien Republican and the only member of her party in favor of the measure during the Public Health Committee vote, said she understands her colleagues’ hesitation around community buy-in and potential effects on crime. 
Marra agrees the sites reduce overdose deaths but said she’s also interested in exploring other interventions that could be effective, like cleaning up the drug supply and stopping drugs from coming in across the border. 
With just three OPCs in the U.S., Marra added that studies about the effects of overdose prevention centers in this country are necessarily limited. There are over a hundred sites around the world, but what might work in Vancouver, for example, may not play out the same way in Waterbury, she said. Plus, she had concerns that the Connecticut bill proposed establishing four sites across the state, when New York City, with well over double the population, has only two.

Part of her questioning nature, Marra said, comes from witnessing the beginnings of the opioid crisis firsthand as a pharmacist. 
“We were taught as pharmacists that if someone was in pain, they would not get addicted to opioids,” Marra said. “Shame on me if I believe anything that quickly again.”
Marra has focused her legislative work in part on addressing the crisis, including a 2023 proposal to put Narcan in vending machines. During a visit to one of the OnPoint sites in New York City a few years ago, Marra became convinced OPCs were a powerful solution. But still, she said, the decision to establish them in Connecticut is “much more nuanced than that.” Other factors, like location and timing, have to make sense, too.
She encouraged elected officials, including Democrats voting ‘yes’ along party lines, to visit.
“Seeing the site, seeing this done, was definitely eye-opening,” Marra said. “If you don’t know what this is about, then go see.”

Success in Rhode Island
In an understated brick building in the heart of Providence’s medical district sits one of three OPCs in the entire country, Project Weber/RENEW. 
From the outside, Project Weber/RENEW looks much like the OB/GYN and spinal health offices that surround it. The first floor is a common space that feels like a cross between a church basement and a community center, outfitted with showers and laundry machines. There’s also a medical suite, staffed with a full-time nurse, behavioral health physician and part-time doctor, available for walk-in patients, with or without insurance. 
On the second floor, clients find the OPC. It’s a meticulously clean environment, with the hospitality of a better-quality medical office. There are individual stations for people to use illegal drugs with sterile supplies, a smoking room with a robust ventilation system, and of course, overdose-reversing naloxone kits. There are also oxygen tanks, which can prevent an overdose without painful withdrawal side effects.

The atmosphere is calm; a mellow Macy Gray song plays from a speaker, and staff members discretely check in on clients every 10 to 15 minutes. There’s even a room equipped with soft surfaces for when clients inadvertently take a drug that agitates them.
The center opened in Providence in January and has received high marks from advocates, elected officials and community members. The staff exude pride in the OPC and their lifesaving work. But the road to realizing that goal was a long and at times heartbreaking slog, one that could offer lessons on Connecticut’s stalled effort to open a center of its own. 
It took multiple attempts before Rhode Island’s governor, Dan McKee, signed an OPC bill in 2021, creating a two-year pilot. But the center still had to be funded, ultimately achieved with $2.6 million in settlement funds from opioid lawsuits. Then, organizations had to bid for the contract. 
Project Weber/RENEW won the bid. The group was already doing harm reduction work, like providing clean syringes, wound care supplies and access to medical treatment. But to open the OPC, they had to find a location and win approval from the Providence City Council.

City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris represents Ward 11, home to the hospital district. She grew up and raised four kids here. When it comes to Ward 11, “I just love it.” 
Harris had some concerns about the OPC (like this common question: wouldn’t the OPC encourage drug use?). She wasn’t necessarily against the idea, but she didn’t want it in her ward, which includes Upper South Providence, a majority Black and Hispanic neighborhood where about a third of residents live below the poverty line. Neighbors there “had more than their fair share” of the city’s social services. 
“No, absolutely not,” Harris remembers thinking at the time.“It’s just too much pressure on the ward.”
Harris prides herself on being a good listener and making decisions based on consensus; in rejecting the OPC, she believed that she was representing her constituents. 
But in the months that followed, Harris began to hear from others, including advocates from Project Weber/RENEW, like Deputy Director Ashley Perry. Perry has lived experience with drug use and got involved with the organization as a volunteer running support groups for sex workers. Perry had been reluctant to engage with recovery groups in the past, which are often structured around repentant confessions.
“It didn’t feel good to always be reminded of the worst things that I’ve done,” Perry said. “I really wanted to move past that, and I really wanted to find safer ways for people who I knew were still suffering in a lot of different ways.” Project Weber/RENEW felt different, a nonjudgmental group giving people the tools to reduce harm and stop using drugs when they were ready.

But after Perry started volunteering, fentanyl sent the overdose death rate soaring. Then COVID worsened the isolation of the community, contributing to a leading cause of overdose: using alone. 
The group staged a mock funeral procession in January 2021, with doctors carrying caskets on their shoulders, representing 384 people who had died in the nation’s smallest state of an overdose the previous year. 
As time went on, Perry and her team became a constant presence in community and state-level meetings on the opioid epidemic, explaining why an OPC was needed. Their team also responded to calls from the community, like requests to pick up needles in neighborhoods. They were, Harris said, relentless. And Harris began attending meetings, too. 
“The more I attended, the more I understood, the more I heard people struggling, the more I heard people losing their family members, the more I heard drug addicts who said, ‘I’m not ready to stop using drugs.’”
Harris’s own granddaughter died of a fentanyl overdose during that time period, at age 26, a young woman she describes as joyful and creative. Harris believes an OPC might have saved her life. 
But it was before her death that Harris came around to the idea of putting the OPC in Ward 11, a change of heart she attributes partly to the location of the building. The proposed location wasn’t in a residential neighborhood or on a Main Street like she feared. Rather, it was a building in the medical district, accessibly located on a bus line.
Between opening day on Jan. 13, 2025, and July 8, Project Weber/RENEW saw 460 unique clients and performed 99 interventions to prevent overdose. They haven’t lost anyone to overdose so far. 
Perry and Harris are quick to talk about the importance of community buy-in as Connecticut considers its own OPC.
In New York City, where the two other OPCs in the U.S. are located, that kind of participation did not happen. City Councilwoman Carmen De La Rosa explained to The Connecticut Mirror that she learned, along with her constituents, during a press conference on the last day of former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration that New York would get two OPCs and that one of them would be located in her district of Washington Heights, a low-to-middle income neighborhood where about half of residents are immigrants. 
“I have to say that that has caused a lot of trouble in terms of the community feeling involved,” De La Rosa said. That includes the choice of location — near one of the largest and most popular parks in the neighborhood.
Though the OPC has since made progress in gaining some community support, De La Rosa said that complaints persist, and she’s often blamed for the OPC, even though she had no say in where it was located. 
“The minute someone runs into a needle somewhere, they bring up the OPC,” she said. “The needle could just have come from someone who is in the throes of addiction and was using on that street. But they’re like, ‘Well, you know, if that OPC wasn’t here, they wouldn’t be able to get needles.’” 
 She wonders what it might have been like if the community had been involved from the get-go, as they were in Providence.

What’s next for Connecticut?
In late May and early June 2025, a spike in overdoses took dozens of lives in New Haven County, sparking a desperate attempt to stem a fatal mix of drugs. As this was taking place, Lamont sent out a press release announcing a significant drop in overdose deaths for 2024. 
Though the release nodded to the seriousness of the issue, it did not mention the crisis that was unfolding. Advocates like Diane Santos, already raw from Lamont’s singlehanded move to prevent OPCs, said the announcement was jarring. 
“To me it says he is either out of touch himself, or he’s getting bad information from somewhere.”
When a bill fails, advocates and lawmakers usually put their heads together and consider what strategy they might try next time to turn public opinion and rally support from other lawmakers. But some advocates in Connecticut say they already had the votes, and there was no public testimony opposing the concept, so they now face a different scenario: they must convince an audience of one, Gov. Lamont, to support the measure. 
Sen. Anwar was among the most committed advocates of the OPC measure. Since the measure failed, he has been publicly criticizing Lamont and says he’s calling Lamont out every time there is an overdose death. 
“It still makes me sad, and it makes me angry,” Anwar said of Lamont’s decision. “Because I value our citizens, and for somebody to make a decision knowingly and then shrug it away like it’s not a big deal is unacceptable to me.” 
Bhargava also lobbied for Lamont’s support. Her son, Alec Pelletier, had been in and out of treatment for substance abuse disorder when he died of an overdose on his birthday in 2018 while living in a sober home. Like Harris’s granddaughter and Diane Santos’s son, he was 26. 
Over the past year, as a student at the Yale School of Public Health and as an advocate, Bhargava educated herself about OPCs, visiting one in Vancouver and speaking with the program managers of the centers in Rhode Island and New York. She came away convinced that such a center could have saved her son’s life. 
The issue, she says, is simply too urgent to wait.  
“We don’t have the time. We just don’t. The time is now. And Gov. Lamont should hold a special session and get this done to save the people’s lives he’s serving to protect.” 
When asked if he would visit an OPC, Lamont said he’s open to it. 
“Visit or call, we’ll see what happens. I don’t want to overpromise. I have an open mind, if that’s what you’re suggesting,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAFE-CONSUMPTION-SITES-0716-SR-22-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-03 05:56:41.418493

Over 100 organizations statewide are uniting to End Child Poverty Now through bold, coordinated advocacy and urgent policy reform.","While Connecticut, one of the wealthiest states in our country, may seem like an ideal place to raise a family, for far too many children it is not. Nearly one in 10 children in Connecticut grows up in poverty. In the City of Waterbury, that statistic is more than double –  with 22% of children living in poverty.
For these kids – our kids – basic needs like stable housing, nutritious food, and access to quality childcare aren’t guaranteed, and the educational opportunities they deserve are often out of reach. While some areas boast world-class schools and enrichment programs, children in poverty are being left behind.
So, is Connecticut a great place to be a child? For many, the answer is no —especially when poverty limits opportunities and dreams feel distant.

That’s why more than 100 organizations – hospitals, higher ed institutions, nonprofits, philanthropy and experts throughout the state — have come together and pledged to End Child Poverty Now! Almost every community foundation serving our 169 towns is involved and leading local efforts to raise awareness, convene partners and advocate on behalf of our state’s children who do not have enough to thrive.   
Morally, we know that this should not be.  Sixty-one years ago, in his 1964 State of the Union Address, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced an unconditional war on poverty and called it a national disgrace that merited a national response. Unfortunately, those calls went unheard until the COVID-19 pandemic brought the issue to the forefront. The pandemic served as an unprecedented global crisis, but it also revealed the profound impact of targeted government assistance in alleviating poverty.  

Through programs like emergency food aid and the refundable child tax credit, we saw a dramatic decrease in child poverty across the United States. In Connecticut, the federal government provided $2,000 to $3,000 in child tax credits per child, and child poverty was reduced by nearly 70%. However, as we now know, this progress was short-lived. The expiration of key pandemic relief programs in 2023 led to a sharp increase in child poverty, serving as a stark reminder that without sustained investment in social safety nets, progress remains fragile at best.

Children in Connecticut were not spared! Even here, with our great wealth, Connecticut experienced skyrocketing child poverty since 2022. According to the report, “Poverty in the U.S. and Connecticut 2019-2023,” by the Connecticut Voices for Children, the supplemental poverty rate was 10.5 percent in 2020, or 74,520 children living in poverty.  By 2021, the child poverty rate had dropped to 6.8 percent or 27,080 children.  Yet, by 2023, our numbers have skyrocketed and exceeded pre-pandemic level. 
This spike tells us that when families have access to financial resources, they can meet their children’s basic needs, invest in education, and create a stable environment in which their children can thrive. To let these gains slip away is not just an economic failure, it is a moral failure. 

The data is clear. Still far too many children in our state are growing up without the things that they need. Child poverty is not inevitable. It is not a natural condition. It is a policy choice and we can advocate for different choices.Kathy Taylor, President and CEO, Connecticut Community Foundation

In June, Connecticut Community Foundation hosted a public forum and panel discussion featuring a Community Data presentation with Mark Abraham, Executive Director DataHaven, and a panel discussion moderated by Ginny Monk, housing reporter for The Connecticut Mirror, with Panelists Emily Byrne, MPA, Executive Director of CT Voices for Children; Chelsea Harris, Director of Early Care & Education, Waterbury Bridge to Success, and Rashida Rattray, Education and Outreach Coordinator, Connecticut Fair Housing Center. Their wide-ranging conversation was both enlightening and sobering; serving as a wake-up call to remember the children and families left behind in our highly resourced state.
This moment calls for a renewed commitment to ending childhood poverty – a commitment that must be underpinned by policy change. The End Child Poverty Now Campaign is a unified platform for advocacy behind a common vision: a thriving and economically robust Connecticut where no child experiences the debilitating effects of poverty. 
This nonprofit advocacy collaborative engages lawmakers and policy influencers to promote and enact policies that address the root causes of child poverty, including income inequality, access to healthcare, safe and affordable homes, and quality education. 
Our collective goal for the 2025 legislative session was to advance the following:  

Support a permanent, refundable CT Child Tax Credit at $600 per child. 
Support universal no-cost healthy school meals (breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack).  
Support universal childcare subsidies for families earning up to 85% of the State Median Income.
Expand good cause eviction protections to support family housing stability. 

We made progress: Connecticut chose to invest in our children’s education, approving a suite of bills designed to enable thousands of additional children to enroll in early childhood education programs. But our work is not finished, and the 2026 legislative session is soon approaching. 
The End Child Poverty Now will continue to advocate for the passage of child-friendly policies that will lead to meaningful change for many more of our children.  We cannot sit and watch while our neighboring states make steady progress to end child poverty.  Now is the time for our vision of being a child-friendly state to be reflected more fully in the everyday experiences of all of our children and families within our state of Connecticut.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)It was such a peaceful morning that Yoshito Matsushige could scarcely believe it was wartime.
Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer who had been up most of the night before covering air raid warnings, woke from a brief nap at army headquarters in time to see the sun rise over Hiroshima.
It was Monday, Aug. 6, 1945.
Now we know Matsushige was witnessing the last sunrise of the age before humankind had developed a weapon powerful enough to annihilate itself — and had demonstrated a willingness to use it.
There had been just one other explosion of a nuclear bomb, a test shot July 16 of a plutonium implosion weapon at the Trinity Site in southern New Mexico. The resulting fireball had fused the sand of the desert floor into a kind of glass later named Trinitite. On the morning of Monday, Aug. 6, another atomic bomb — a uranium gun-type device — was bound for Hiroshima.
Wednesday marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, a grim milestone that has me pondering the nature of time, memory and hope. It’s been slightly more than an average human lifetime since the bomb devastated Hiroshima, and those who are still around to recount the unthinkable are increasingly few. Once Hiroshima and Nagasaki fade from living memory, how will its warning be passed to future generations?
At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, an American B-29 named the Enola Gay, after the pilot’s mother, released a 12-kiloton atomic bomb over the city. The aircraft was flying six miles up. The aim point was a T-shaped bridge in the center of the city. The bomb fell for 43 seconds and then detonated at 1,968 feet.
What happened next took only milliseconds.
The temperature on the ground reached 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit, vaporizing humans near the epicenter and leaving only their shadows behind. A 1,000-mph blast wave spread from the epicenter, destroying two-thirds of the city’s homes and buildings and contributing to a massive firestorm. A dark mushroom cloud rose over Hiroshima, carrying deadly radioactive fallout.
Matsushige had left army headquarters and returned to his home, about a mile and a half from the target bridge, where he was sitting shirtless in the August heat eating a meager breakfast of rice.
“There is an explosive called magnesium that is used for photographic (lighting) and everything went white as if that magnesium had been fired,” Matsushige told me through an interpreter in 1986, when I was a young reporter in Japan on a grant project to interview those who had experienced the bomb. “It seemed the light was an electrical short, or spark. So I was about to stand up and try to switch off the light, … and then came the blast.”
The force lifted Matsushige from his feet and slammed him into a far wall. He was covered in debris and broken glass, and his bare chest was bleeding, although he wasn’t badly hurt. He and his wife ran outside and hid in a sweet potato field for 40 minutes in the dirty brown gloom of ash and dust. Then Matsushige put on his uniform, retrieved his Mamiya camera from the rubble of his home and two rolls of film, and set out for newspaper office in the heart of the city.
Matsushige was a photojournalist but like most everyone else in Japan had also been pressed into military service. He worked for both the city newspaper and military headquarters, wearing a uniform with no rank insignia. Civilian photography was prohibited.
When he was about a kilometer, or six-tenths of a mile, from the center of the city, he had to turn back because the fire was too intense. He made his way to the Miyuki Bridge. The bridge was a landmark in a city known for its bridges and river, but this morning it was swarmed by thousands of wounded and dying civilians.
In 1986, I stood with Matsushige on the Miyuki Bridge and he told me what he had seen 41 years earlier. It was one of the last times the photographer, then in his early 70s, would visit the bridge, which was closed and about to be demolished to make way for a new structure. My interview with Matsushige originally appeared in my newspaper, the Pittsburg (Kansas) Morning Sun, which had sponsored my application for the Akiba Project travel grant to interview the aging hibakusha, a Japanese term translated as those who had received or been exposed to the bomb. In 2021 I wrote about my memories of that assignment for the Reflector.
Matsushige told me in 1986 that he had yet to take a single photograph on his grim trek into the city but here, at the bridge, he readied his Mamiya. Many of those on the bridge were junior high school students. Unlike elementary school children, most of whom had been evacuated to relatives and others in the hills around the city, the junior high students had been kept in the city to clear fire lines or to work in the ammunition factories. The victims on the bridge looked as if their clothes were hanging from their bodies, but they weren’t trailing fabric, it was tattered pieces of their own skin.
“I thought that I would take a photo of (the scene on the bridge), so I checked the camera in my hands,” Matsushige said. “When I saw this tragic scene, I was unable to push the shutter button. Among these people, there was a person holding a child. She was crying the name of the baby, and the baby probably was dead. The mother was saying, ‘Please open your eyes, please open your eyes.'”
It took Matsushige more than a quarter of an hour to make a photo.
“I felt as if the eyes of these people were piercing me,” he said. “These people had black faces because of the burns. It was such cruelty. I couldn’t stop my tears as I tried to take that second picture, and I remember that the viewfinder of my camera was blurred because of the tears.”
He returned home but set out again that afternoon.
He attempted to go to the newspaper office again but found it ablaze. He passed Hiroshima University, where he saw corpses at the bottom of a swimming pool that had been nearly emptied by the heat. The deeper he went into the city, the greater the destruction.
“People were under collapsed buildings and utility poles and were buried alive,” he said. “Among (the corpses) there were some mothers with children. I was totally numb. I didn’t feel anything, didn’t feel any heat or pain.”
He found a streetcar filled with corpses.
“All their clothes were burnt off,” he said. “I thought about taking a picture, I put my hands on my camera at one time, but since all these dead people were naked, I felt (ashamed) to take such a photo.”
Hours later he found himself back at the Miyuki Bridge, where he took a photograph of an injured policeman writing out relief certificates for food rations. The photo of the policeman was the last Matsushige would take that day. He had carried enough film for 24 exposures but ended up making only five. Two of the photos were at his home, two on the bridge, and one at an intersection near the bridge.
  Only five photos were made the day the bomb fell on Hiroshima, all by the same man — Yoshito Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer. He was at home at the time the bomb was dropped on the morning of. Aug. 6, 1945, He made his way into the city. The first photo he took, around 11 a.m., was of badly burned junior high school students on the Miyuki Bridge. What appears to be rags is, in many cases, skin hanging from arms and legs. (Yoshito Matsushige)
Matsushige took some of the hardtack biscuits next to the policeman’s station for his and his wife’s dinner. After it was dark, he developed the film in trays in the kitchen sink and washed the negatives in a nearby creek. He hung the strip of film in a tree to dry. The photos weren’t published in the Hiroshima newspaper until the next year. They didn’t appear in the United States until Life magazine published them in 1952.
The death toll at Hiroshima was horrific. Estimates vary widely, but at least 70,000 died from the bombing. Three days later, on Aug. 9, a plutonium bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing another 40,000. These are conservative estimates, however, and the actual number might be double for each city.
When I went to Japan to interview Matsushige and the other hibakusha in 1986, it was the height of the Cold War. There were 70,374 nuclear warheads deployed or in stockpiles around the world, according the Federation of American Scientists, an all-time high. Of those, all but a few thousand belonged to the United States and the Soviet Union. The Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist’s graphic representation of how close we were to nuclear annihilation, was at six minutes to midnight.
Now the Doomsday Clock is at 89 seconds.
There are fewer nuclear weapons — about 12,000, according to the FAS — but there are hot wars around the world, tensions are high, and the Doomsday Clock now takes into account other existential risks.
“We now move the Doomsday Clock from 90 seconds to 89 seconds to midnight — the closest it has ever been to catastrophe,” the Bulletin said in a January 2025 statement. “Our fervent hope is that leaders will recognize the threats posed by nuclear weapons, climate change, and the potential misuse of biological science and a variety of emerging technologies.”
The Bulletin cited emerging and re-emerging disease and the military use of artificial intelligence as concerning. It also said threat of nuclear war had been exacerbated by various conflicts.
“The war in Ukraine, now in its third year, looms over the world,” it said. “The conflict could become nuclear at any moment because of a rash decision or through accident or miscalculation. Conflict in the Middle East threatens to spiral out of control in a wider war without warning.”
The 10 or so countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and the role of their arsenals, the Bulletin said, and the nuclear arms control treaty process is collapsing.
We seem hellbent on our own destruction.
In my hand is a relic of the birth of the nuclear age, a bit of Trinitite that my wife, Kim, bought at a rock shop in New Mexico near Alamogordo. Yes, it’s legal to possess because it was gathered from the site decades ago, and no, it’s no longer dangerously radioactive. Why did she want it? Because she gathers information of all kinds — books, objects, experiences — that will help her understand the beauty and darkness of the world. The Trinitite sample cost a few bucks and is only mildly radioactive. It’s about the size of a peanut, is greenish black, and weighs about the same as the albatross in the Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.
Trinitite is among the artifacts that were to be included in the Library of the Great Silence, a catalog of objects representing transitions and periods of existential threat. The project was part of the SETI Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to the search for intelligent life beyond earth. The library is a response, in part, to the Fermi Paradox. Posed by physicist Enrico Fermi, the paradox asks why, given how vast and old the universe is, we haven’t found evidence of other communicative technological civilizations?
I won’t bore you with the math behind the Drake Equation, which seeks to estimate how many intelligent worlds there might be out there, except to cite the most important variable, L. That stands for the average lifespan of technological civilizations. One explanation for the great silence is that civilizations have a tendency to destroy themselves. Nobody knows what L might be, because we have a lack of observable data, but our current estimate is at least 80 years.
If we are not to fall into the great silence, we must learn to do a better job of passing on the lessons of the past. Part of that is honoring the testimony of those who have gone before, such as Yoshito Matsushige.
Matsushige died in 2005, at the age of 92, but his words and his pictures live on. They were given to me in 1986, and now I share them with you.
The time the bomb detonated will be observed with a moment of silence at 8:15 a.m. Wednesday in Hiroshima. That’s 6:15 p.m. Tuesday for most of Kansas, because of the 14-hour time difference.
Honoring the dead is proper.
But too many of us who yearn for peace content ourselves with prayer and visualization. This may be mentally healthy and personally satisfying, but it’s not enough to turn policy or change minds. The pursuit of peace is an active one, requiring a knowledge of the past combined with a willingness to engage the future.
It’s 89 seconds to midnight.
Let’s raise some L.

The final approval came days ago from the MTA, parent of Metro-North, which rubber-stamped the Connecticut Department of Transportation’s fare hike decision.  At least one MTA Board member called the hikes “scary” and another exclaimed that he was “actually kind of offended”.  But, hey… there is nobody on the MTA Board representing Connecticut riders so they both voted to approve the hike as did the entire MTA Board.  After all, it’s not their money.


Mind you, the MTA is also shortly expected to approve a 4.4% fare hike for New York’s Metro-North riders as well as a 25-cent increase for New York City subways and buses, so put that in your pipe of moral indignation and smoke it.
As I explained a few weeks ago, the Connecticut fare increase can be blamed on Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature, which knowingly under-cut the CDOT budget, pretty much telling the agency to raise fares to make up the difference.  After all, they seem to assume that everyone who rides Metro-North along Connecticut’s “gold coast” is a millionaire. 
But a 10% increase in one year?  On top of a 4.5% hike just two years ago?  That adds up to a compounded 15.2% increase since 2023… way more than inflation.  Remember, Metro-North has a captive audience and can do anything it wants.

And adding insult to injury, there are new ticket rules coming!
With more and more commuters buying one-way e-tickets (57%) instead of monthly passes (36%), those tickets will automatically be activated on purchase, not when you get on the train and activate them yourself.  Why?  Because, the railroad says, 55% of ticket holders don’t activate their tickets until they see the conductor coming around. 
But isn’t it the conductor’s job to collect those fares and put seat checks on each row?
According to MTA Deputy Chief Jessica Lazarus “Conductors are spending more than 20,000 hours each year reminding customers to activate one-way mobile tickets.” Really?  How did they come up with that metric?
Requiring activation of the ticket at time of purchase, she says, will “recapture those hours that can be better put to use for fare collection and train safety operations.”  Like enforcing the “no radios rule” and “no feet on seats?”
If you’re doing a same-day roundtrip you won’t buy two one-way tickets but, instead, a new Day Pass.  It’s good for unlimited travel until 4 a.m. the next day. Day-trippers using the pass will get a 10% fare discount compared to buying two one-way peak tickets.
For hybrid commuters, after buying ten one-way tickets within two weeks the 11th will be free.  For seniors, the disabled and those on Medicare, the new reduced fare ticket will be valid at all times, even in the morning peak.
Make no mistake:  fare evasion is a serious problem for MTA, which estimates they lose $700 million each year, most of it on buses ($315 M) and subways ($285 M).  Metro-North losses are estimated at $44 M.  Given that train fares are much more expensive than bus and subway, that’s not a lot of commuter scofflaws; just 6% of riders compared to 15% of subways riders and 37% of bus passengers.

Of course, bus riders can easily board by the rear door and subway riders can jump over turnstiles.  On Metro-North we have conductors.  It’s an hour-long ride from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal, plenty of time to look at everyone’s ticket… which they will still have to do even under the new rules.
But what about the Dashing Dan running to make his train, grabbing a seat and then trying to buy an e-ticket in a cellphone dead spot, nervously watching the conductor moving down the aisle?  No ticket to show?  You’ll get whacked with a $2 surcharge.
Here are the optics:  Connecticut lawmakers short-change the CDOT budget, basically saying “let the commuters pick up the tab.”  Now MTA makes commuting less convenient with new ticket rules.
We all end up paying more and getting no improvement.  The trains are no faster or reliable… and maybe less attractive as a transportation choice.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Metro-North-shot-ephillips.jpg,,,2025-08-03 04:56:44.457753

As legislators were set to gavel in at 10 a.m., about a dozen protesters lined the hallways to advocate for legislators overriding the veto, with signs reading “vote like your kids live here,” “vote to override” and “fund public education!” 
One protester was Peter Sidmore, a middle school teacher in the Juneau School District, where he graduated in 2019.  
“It’s impressive how much the system in town has degraded in the six years since I graduated, just due to lack of funding. And I’ve been pretty present to see all of that, because we did have a fairly robust school system, and it’s really changed,” he said. 
Sidmore said that last year, the consolidation of Juneau’s two high schools was especially hard on students. This year, it’s the continued climate of uncertainty, he said. 
“That’s the hardest part. When we have a direction and we know what we’re getting, and we know what we can do, we can prepare students to an extent, but it’s the indecisiveness, it’s the back and forth that really, really is hard on students. Yeah, you hear that in education all the time. It’s just, you want to have a plan, even if it’s not the best,” Sidmore said.
McLain Sidmore, standing with him holding a sign, works for an education nonprofit in Juneau. “I see classes seem to be getting bigger every year,” McLain Sidmore said. “Teachers are being moved around until weeks into the school year; there are students not getting the services they need. And just parents are stressed. Kids are stressed. Teachers are stressed.”
Eric Antrim, an engineer with the U.S. Forest Service, as well as a member of the National Federation of Federal Employees, NFFE Local 251, held a sign reading “education is our future.” 
“I benefited from a public education growing up, and that was good enough to get me into engineering school and to perform well,” he said. “And I want our Legislature to act responsibly and pay it forward. They all benefited from safe schools and good schooling, and they shouldn’t be taking that away from the next generation.”
Debra Craig, a 43-year-resident of Juneau, said she worked in state government in social services. “So I have a fairly deep understanding of the challenges that people face when they don’t have adequate resources,” she said. “And education is like a fundamental resource that people need to be able to get ahead in the world, to be able to survive, to be able to just exist adequately.”
Craig said she’s concerned about the quality of education in Alaska, especially the lack of civics education and understanding of government. “Alaska is one of eight states that doesn’t require students graduating from high school to pass a civics test. And I think all of that is showing up throughout the United States in our national politics and our state politics,” she said. “So we need to support education. We need to support civics education so people understand what their government does, and doesn’t do for them.”
Outside the Capitol, a rally kicked off at 11 a.m with a crowd gathered to join a national day of action, and to support public education in Alaska. More than 300 demonstrations were set to take place on Saturday, part of a “Rage Against the Regime” protest against the Trump administration and threats to democracy, due process, and civil rights and freedoms. 
Speakers condemned the Trump administration’s actions on immigrant communities, public services and higher education, and they called for solidarity to continue protesting the president. 
“Public schools are democracy’s tools!” the crowd chanted. 
Just after 1:30 p.m., legislators voted to override two of the governor’s veto. A handful of demonstrators in the hall cheered senators after they left the house chambers.  
“It was great. We were very happy,” said Pat Race, a demonstrator who was standing outside the House doors. He’s a Juneau-based filmmaker and illustrator, and a product of Alaska schools. “There was a lot of clapping and then shushing of the clapping, because they were still working on things. But both veto overrides were a really big deal. And it was really nice to see them come through,” he said, referring to legislators also voting to override a veto of Senate Bill 183, a bill to require reports on oil tax settlements.
“And afterwards,” he added. “It was a sunny day in Juneau, and I fled the building for a celebratory taco.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said her office was going to shed “sunlight” on the University of Iowa’s DEI policies through her office’s investigation following a request from Gov. Kim Reynolds earlier this week.
Bird spoke on the issue at the annual “Bird Barn Bash,” a fundraiser for the attorney general as she looks ahead to running for another term in 2026. Bird, who was first elected in 2022, spoke about her time challenging federal policies during former President Joe Biden’s tenure, but also spoke on a more recent issue – investigating UI for potential noncompliance with state and federal policies banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
Fox News published an “undercover” video Tuesday of a person identified as Andrea Tinoco, the assistant director of UI Leadership and Student Organization Development, who said her department was still committed to working on DEI despite directives from university leadership.

After the video was posted, Reynolds issued a statement saying she was “appalled” by the comments made in the video and would be filing a complaint to the Attorney General’s office for further action. On Friday, a second video was posted by Townhall, a conservative outlet, of another UI employee identified as Cory Lockwood, senior associate director of the Iowa Union Memorial, making similar comments about continued work on DEI initiatives.
Both employees featured in the videos have been placed on administrative leave.
At the fundraiser Saturday, Bird said her office has launched an investigation into the situation and “is going to get to the bottom of it” – but asked the crowd for patience.
“Please know – the investigation’s going to take a little bit,” Bird said. “I know all of us want it to be fast — and we will not make it be slow — but I’ll tell you, to do something right, it takes time. And we’re going to do it right, we’re going to do it by the book and by the law.”
She also reiterated her commitment to upholding the ban on DEI at Iowa’s regents universities, saying ”here in Iowa, our taxpayer-funded universities are supposed to be about education, not indoctrination.”
Talk radio host Simon Conway, who spoke in support of Bird at the event, said the UI investigation shows the importance of having Bird in office – and reelecting her for another term. He said former Attorney General Tom Miller, the longtime Democratic incumbent who Bird defeated in 2022, would not have followed up on Reynolds’ request to investigate the university if he was in office.
“If we had Tom Miller, or a Tom Miller, in the attorney general’s chair right now, with what is going on in our state in regards to DEI — I think first of all, there’d be a really good chance that regents universities would be losing federal funding,” Conway said. “They still might, by the way. But I think it’s an absolute given if he was there. And you don’t want to see that, do you?”
Cruz, Schmitt stay in D.C.
U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Eric Schmitt of Missouri were also scheduled to speak at the event, but both were unable to attend. The U.S. Senate was in session Saturday, with Senate Republicans aiming to confirm more than 100 of President Donald Trump’s nominees despite a breakdown in negotiations with Senate Democrats.
Bird said she was disappointed the two Republican senators could not be at the event, but that she told them on behalf of attendees, “we want you to do your job like you’re doing, confirming President Trump’s nominees.”
Schmitt will be back in the state later in the month, Aug. 23, for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s fundraiser in Cedar Rapids.
Bird was considered a top choice to become the next Republican nominee for governor in the 2026 election cycle, following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek reelection after finishing her current term. But in July, Bird announced she would not run for governor, instead running for reelection for her current position.
At the event, Bird said she had spoken with many people in the crowd about her plans in 2026 – and that her decision to run for reelection was because she believed there was still more she had to accomplish in the role.
“We’ve done some good things in the attorney general’s office to help Iowa but we are not done,” Bird said. “The work is not done. And I’m not going to leave that unfinished to run for something else.”

BURLINGTON — Vermont Green Football Club are national champions. 
The Green toppled Seattle-based Ballard FC, 2-1, in Saturday night’s United Soccer League 2 championship game at the University of Vermont in Burlington. Thousands of fans turned out to the Green’s home stadium at the school, Virtue Field, to watch the team cap off its undefeated 2025 season with its first-ever national-level prize. 
United Soccer League 2 is a semi-professional, summertime competition made up largely of collegiate players. It has about 150 total teams across the country.
Saturday’s win was the culmination of a dream run for Vermont Green, which is in its fourth season and has garnered international attention for its outspoken support of climate justice and other progressive social causes. The team regularly draws sellout crowds for its home games, boasting some of the highest average attendance of any similar team in the country. 
After tying just three regular-season games and winning every other, the Green won its local United Soccer League 2 division, the Northeast Division, in early July. Later that month, the team topped the league’s regional Eastern Conference bracket to advance to the final stages of the national playoffs.
Saturday’s win marks the second national championship for a Vermont-based soccer team in the past year. Last December, the University of Vermont men’s soccer team won the NCAA Division I championship, the first national collegiate title in a major sport in school history. Four UVM players were part of the Vermont Green team that won Saturday’s game.

Andy Barr and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — have been taking snipes at each other on the campaign trail this summer as they barrel toward the May 2026 primary, but […]","U.S. Senate candidates (from left) Nate Morris, Andy Barr and Daniel Cameron before speaking at annual Fancy Farm Picnic, on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)FANCY FARM, Ky. — The top three Republican candidates hoping to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate — former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — have been taking snipes at each other on the campaign trail this summer as they barrel toward the May 2026 primary, but they pulled out the stops for the annual Fancy Farm Picnic. They laid into the event’s tradition of trading zingers with opponents Saturday afternoon in the small West Kentucky town.  
The picnic, a fundraiser for the St. Jerome Catholic Church, has historically brought together Democrats and Republicans for roasts from the stage as supporters and detractors yell and heckle. With Kentucky’s top Democrats, including Gov. Andy Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman skipping the event Saturday afternoon, Republicans either joked at the lack of their presence or toward each other, in the case of the GOP Senate candidates. 
Beshear said he had a scheduling conflict and Coleman said the stage should be reserved for candidates on the ballot. 
Each Senate candidate tried to tie themselves closer to President Donald Trump, who has not made an endorsement in the race so far. Morris took it a step further by tying his opponents to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is not running for re-election and who also spoke at the picnic. 
Cameron won a coin toss to speak first. He joked about the lack of Democrats, saying “there aren’t even enough of them to run Joe Biden’s autopen.” Kentucky U.S. Rep. James Comer, also a speaker at the picnic, is leading a probe into the former’s president’s alleged use of an autopen to sign documents. 
“But look, I understand why they aren’t here,” Cameron said of the Democrats. “They’re out searching for a national identity, which is going to be hard to find when they’re afraid of being misgendered.”

Cameron took some swipes at his opponents, saying Barr has voted with former Democratic U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and that Morris donated to former United Nation Ambassador Nikki Haley’s 2024 presidential campaign. Cameron also said Morris had supported diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as a company executive in the past. 
“Some would say his campaign reminds him of a fart: it stinks, it’s unproductive and it’s a sign that the emitter is full of crap,” Cameron said of Morris. 
Cameron ended his speech by saying that he and his wife, Makenze, want their sons to grow up in a “a colorblind society — one based on merit and opportunity, not division and handouts.” He vowed to be focused on “the future, not the past,” as senator. 
For the most part, Barr focused on his record in Congress and touting his support for Trump’s policies in office. He did tease Beshear for his absence and his rumored aspirations to run for president in 2028, saying that “Americans will soon learn what we Kentuckians already know — he’s as liberal as he is boring.”

“I’d say anyone could beat this guy, but I wouldn’t want to offend Daniel Cameron,” Barr said, referring to Cameron’s loss to Beshear in the 2023 governor’s race. 
Barr added that he hopes Kentucky keeps “the tradition alive of Andys beating Daniels.” 
But Morris was also the punchline of some of Barr’s remarks, calling him a “dumpster fire” and attacking his business record and his Haley donations as well. 
Barr ended by promising to be a “friend” to West Kentucky, with several regional nods, like supporting the military at Fort Knox and cheering on Murray State University in sporting events. 
Morris was critical of McConnell ahead of the picnic and opened by saying, “I didn’t realize this was bring your boys to work day,” referring to Barr’s and Cameron’s ties to the senior Kentucky senator. 
Speaking last out of the three, Morris told the crowd that he wanted them to remember three things about him — that he supports Trump, he started a garbage company in Kentucky and that he’s “going to trash Mitch McConnell’s legacy.” 
“The third one is pissing off a lot of people, but I have a serious question — who here can honestly tell me that it’s a good thing to have a senior citizen who freezes on national television during his press conferences as our U.S. senator?” Morris said, referring to 2023 episodes McConnell had in front of reporters.

Morris said that Barr and Cameron would continue the senator’s legacy in office, calling them the “McConnell boys.” 
“To break some real news here, perhaps you could both show us the seat of your britches so we can finally understand where Mitch McConnell’s hand goes.” 
McConnell spoke before the Senate candidates, but didn’t directly address them in his remarks. A longtime attendee, Fancy Farm organizers presented McConnell with a plaque before the speeches began to recognize his frequent participation. 
However, McConnell did share some thoughts on the race during the Graves County GOP Breakfast earlier Saturday morning. The event’s attendees included Republicans from the region and around the state, as well as the GOP Senate candidates. 
“Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell said. “Now I’m wondering how you want to be different from the longest serving Senate leader in American history. I’m wondering how you’d want to be different in supporting President Trump.” 
McConnell then posed a “little quiz” to the crowd: “Which of Kentucky’s two Republican senators supports President Trump the most?” Multiple people in the crowd replied, “You.” 
McConnell argued that he’s repeatedly supported Trump more often than U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who did not go to the picnic this year, pointing out that Paul voted against the GOP spending megabill, while McConnell supported it. McConnell also had his staff tally up the money he’s brought to Kentucky while being in office for 41 years, saying the total was $60 billion. 
“I leave by thanking you all for giving me this remarkable opportunity,” McConnell said.”Not just to help myself, not just to brag on how long I may have been there, but look at the difference that I’ve made to try to help us move into a different place — a place when they talk about Kentucky, they talk about how well we’re doing, not how many people we have, how well we’re doing.” 
When McConnell stood before the crowd of Republicans, he received a standing ovation. Cameron and Barr also stood and clapped for McConnell while Morris stayed seated. 
The lone Democrat
Only one Democratic candidate addressed the crowd at the Fancy Farm Picnic — John “Drew” Williams, who is challenging Comer in the 1st Congressional District. The district includes Fancy Farm and West Kentucky. He kept his remarks mostly focused on Comer’s record and told the crowd that he would offer them more public service if elected to Congress.

Comer spoke after Williams, but largely talked about national issues and made fun of Beshear. However, he did add that he didn’t know Williams’ name but still brought him a gift from Washington, D.C. A Comer supporter then came to the stage and held up a prop poster with an endorsement of “Comer’s opponent,” signed by Biden’s autopen. 
Williams had a chance to campaign in a room of Democratic voters the Friday night before the picnic at the Marshall County Democrats’ Mike Miller Memorial Bean Dinner. In an interview with the Kentucky Lantern, he said he has wanted to speak at the Fancy Farm Picnic since he was in middle school, so he was excited for the opportunity.
However, he said he didn’t blame other Democrats like Beshear for not going to a “hateful space” but added that it “doesn’t mean that it has to stay that way.” He’d like to see the space become a way for candidates to have a conversation. 
“I’d much rather me pick an issue, they pick an issue, and we come together. They don’t do that.”
During the dinner, Coleman reiterated that her decision to not go to the picnic this year was because she was not on the ballot. She said there were “so many obvious jokes” to make “but not much worth laughing about in this moment.” 
She hinted that Kentucky’s statewide races in 2027, which would include the governor’s race to succeed Beshear, may bring her back to the picnic stage. 
“We have to leave here tonight with a renewed sense of purpose,” she said. “We have to leave here and talk to our neighbors, listen to their concerns, and remind them that we are fighting for their kids’ and grandkids’ schools, for their families’ security and for a Kentucky where every person has a chance to thrive.”

Speaking to reporters after her speech, Coleman said that the Fancy Farm Picnic has become a “tradition for many, many years” for people in West Kentucky. She added that it’s an exciting year to have the first female emcee, Ashli Watts, the president and CEO of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. But Coleman argued she showed up for rural people in other ways, like supporting the rebuilding efforts after devastating tornadoes in West Kentucky. 
When asked if she thought Democrats should find an alternative event to the picnic, which has become dominated by Republican speakers in recent years, or if changes should be made to its format, she recalled the attempted assassination of Trump on the campaign trail and the attacks earlier this summer on Minnesota Democratic lawmakers, that left a state representative and her husband dead and seriously wounded a state senator and his wife. 
“We got to think about the rhetoric. We’ve got to think about the way that we present things. And jokes are one thing, but it can get out of hand, and especially in an environment like that, I could see how it could,” she said. “So, I would leave it to the people who run the organization. I saw that they said they have to evolve with the times, and then got some primary candidates this year. I would encourage them to evolve with the times when it comes to rhetoric as well.”
Matthew Powell, a member of the Graves County Democratic Party, attended the dinner in a Beshear 2028 shirt. He said he likes Beshear because of what he’s done for the area during his response to tornadoes and floods, calling him a “champion for the working class and myself.” 
Powell didn’t mind the governor skipping the Fancy Farm Picnic. 
“His record speaks volume. He’s been in Fancy Farm and in Mayfield before, and when it counted. He was there with us in Mayfield, Kentucky, through the tornadoes and the flooding. So yes, he’s always there with us.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 20:56:11.046726

The vote was 45-14. Forty-five votes are needed to override an Alaska governor’s budget veto.
The override eliminates a 5.6% year-over-year cut to public school funding, leaving districts with a small funding increase. 
School district superintendents said before the vote that if lawmakers were able to override the governor, they would be able to reduce class sizes and restore programs that had been cut.
Lawmakers were also expected to vote on whether or not to override Dunleavy’s veto of Senate Bill 183, a measure that would require the Alaska Department of Revenue to provide lawmakers with a report on oil tax settlements. Sen Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, has said that could reveal the state has been settling tax disputes for much less than their stated value. 
As the session opened, Dunleavy issued another version of an executive order creating a cabinet-level Alaska Department of Agriculture.
Lawmakers rejected the governor’s first executive order on a 32-28 vote in March and introduced broader legislation instead.
The presiding officers of the House and Senate responded to the second order with a letter of their own, saying that the governor’s order is unconstitutional and that they will not accept it.
The governor’s office did not respond to a question asking what it thinks of the legislative response.

The Denver protest was led by Colorado 50501, which also organized “Good Trouble” demonstrations honoring civil rights leader John Lewis on July 17, and “No Kings” anti-Trump protests in mid-June. The “Rage Against the Regime” protests, which were planned in more than 300 cities across the United States, focused on bringing communities “together to transform anger into action, harnessing the energy of collective resistance,” according to the 50501 website. 
Several local left-leaning groups, including the Denver chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the immigrant rights group Aurora Unidos CSO, set up booths in front of the Capitol on Saturday. 
The demonstrators protested President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations, the elimination of federal funding for public media by Congress, and mass layoffs at several federal agencies, among other Trump administration priorities.

At around 12:15 p.m., organizers led chants of “When we fight, we win” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” which were met with clapping from the crowd and honks from passing cars. 
Brandon Quintanilla, a co-founder of Aurora Unidos CSO, called for protestors to “stand up for our immigrant communities and educate our neighbors.” Quintanilla, 23, said members of his family were deported several years ago, adding that “these attacks on our people have been happening for years, and they have only escalated to unprecedented levels under the Trump administration.”
“We are all well aware of the attacks on our people: masked (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents picking up our parents as they pick up the trash, our siblings being picked up on the way to work or to immigration court,” Quintanilla said.
Protestors yelled “shame” when Quintanilla mentioned the recent federal Republican tax cut and spending law’s allocation of $170 billion in funding for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Denver residents Phaedra Andersen, 54, and Nancy Andersen, 71, have attended several anti-Trump protests in the past eight months. The mother-daughter duo first got involved in community organizing decades ago. Phaedra’s first protest was at age 13, against apartheid in South Africa, while Nancy started out with Vietnam War protests.
“I am hoping that we can break this cycle of human rights violations,” Nancy said. “If anyone’s rights are violated, all of our rights can be attacked. We are on the very edge of losing our democracy.”
Robynn Bartholomew, 52, attended the Denver protest carrying dozens of handmade bracelets beaded with the word “resist.” She stood near the Capitol and handed them out for free to fellow demonstrators.
“I just wanted to do what I could, what’s in my lane, to lift people up, because this is a marathon, not a sprint,” Bartholomew said. “Every day there’s a new thing that can bring you down, but I’m trying to make people smile. We need to come together.”

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”

For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.

The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

The party approved a new rule that allows it to remove Republican candidates from a re-election ballot if they appoint a Democrat in their term. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Republican Party Saturday approved a new rule that would allow the party to disqualify an elected GOP official if they appoint a Democrat to a position during their term.
About 83% of the attendants at the GOP Summer Meeting in Montgomery voted for the rule that prohibits elected partisan officials from appointing people other than Republicans. Suzelle Josey, a former candidate for Senate District 30 in 2014, wrote the rule change. 
Josey said in an interview after the meeting that the rule is meant to send a message to Republicans to keep Republicans in office.
“If you are Republican, if you have taken Republican support, if you have depended upon people to get out there and knock on doors for you, taking money, their time, their treasure, once you have the opportunity and the privilege of being elected as a Republican, then we certainly would expect you to be appointing Republicans when you have the opportunity,” Josey said. “We hope this bylaw change will send a message to elected Republican officials that we have new expectations.”
In the chairman’s report, John Wahl claimed that Democrats do not listen to opposing views or debate, but said that the new rule would allow Republicans to be in the room in areas that are typically Democratic. 
“You would never see a Democrat appoint a Republican,” Wahl said in an interview. “I want to see Republicans taking seriously the fact that we want the opportunity to debate. The open debate here is actually giving Republican appointees the chance to go out and talk to their community, explain their values that they may never have the chance to do if they weren’t appointed to these positions.”
The Alabama Democratic Party’s bylaws do not have a similar rule.
Wahl also gave the 287 attendants an update on the congressional redistricting litigation. The court ordered the state to draw a new congressional map in 2023 after nearly two years of litigation with two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The panel determined that voting in Alabama is racially polarized, with white voters tending to support Republicans and Black voters tending to support Democrats. With that determination, the judges ruled that the Legislature-approved map did not give Black voters the ability to choose their preferred leaders, and ordered a majority-minority congressional district and a district with a near-majority of Black voters to be drawn. 
After a trial earlier this year, the court ruled in May that Alabama had intentionally discriminated against Black voters by approving a map in 2023 that initially only had one majority-Black district. The judges are considering sanctions, which could include requiring court approval of any future congressional maps, a process known as preclearance.
Wahl said that the litigation is not fair because California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to redraw the state’s congressional districts to include more Democratic seats. Texas Republicans on Wednesday drafted a map that would flip five Democratic-held districts.
“California and New York redistricted based on a political basis, without any repercussions from federal courts,” Wahl said. “Now I’m not arguing that anyone should be unrepresented, but I’m going to tell you double standards are not okay.”
Wahl said that majority-minority districts were inherently racist because not all members of minority groups vote for Democratic candidates.
“It shouldn’t matter what the color of your skin is. And if that’s the case, then if any district is drawn based on the color of someone’s skin, it is racist by the nature of that decision,” Wahl said. “I do not think this should be a political or or racial decision. This should be based on communities of interest and traditional lines.”
The party also established qualifying dates for the 2026 midterms. State and county GOP candidates must file their candidacy between Jan. 5 at 8:30 a.m. and Jan. 23 at 5 p.m. with the party’s chairman, according to the resolution that passed at the meeting. The resolution was amended from the qualifying period for statewide candidates only starting on Jan. 12 with 69% of the party’s support. 
“I think it’s confusing to have two different dates there as a former county party chair,” said Michael Hoyt, former Baldwin County GOP chair. “I think it’s helpful to have uniform dates across the board. I think a lot of the 11 day period is far too short.”
Wahl said the original 11 day period was due to the primary election being moved from May 26 to May 19, and the qualifying period could not start sooner because of winter holidays.
“Originally it was at three weeks for county parties and two weeks for the state party. Members felt that they would like to have the dates consistent,” Wahl said in an interview after the meeting.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0174-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 15:56:49.562015

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Rapid City has conducted what sources in law enforcement and government say could be one of the first compliance checks for hemp-based intoxicants since a South Dakota law banning their sale took effect a little over a year ago. 
The Pennington County Sheriff’s Office, Rapid City Police Department and Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office partnered on the operation.
Officers and deputies visited eight area smoke shops and convenience stores on Thursday, purchasing products like gummies, suckers, vape cartridges and beverages containing hemp-derived ingredients. 
The products will be tested to see if they contain any of the prohibited high-inducing chemicals lawmakers voted to restrict in 2024. 
Law banning sale of some near-pot products takes effect, but won’t prevent every legal high

The compounds occur in tiny amounts in hemp plants, but are synthesized to infuse into consumable goods at levels significant enough to induce marijuana-like euphoric feelings in those who use them. The law is targeted at the synthetic versions of the compounds, sold under names like Delta-8 and THC-O, sometimes called “diet weed.”
The bill restricting the sale of those products did not bar the possession of them. Their sale is a low-level misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
A press release on the operation said businesses were sent letters on June 10 warning them to pull offending products from their shelves.
“We want to better understand what’s being sold in our community and ensure that both consumers and retailers are informed,” Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel said in the press release.
Katy Urban, spokeswoman for Roetzel’s office, told South Dakota Searchlight that the products collected in the end-of-July sweep will be tested at local law enforcement laboratories, and by the State Health Lab in Pierre.
There is no specific timeline for results. 
Since the law banning the products took effect on July 1, 2024, 100 charges have been filed, according to the State Unified Judicial System. Spokeswoman Alisa Bousa said the figure includes pending and completed cases, and that each case could involve multiple charges. 
Rep. Brian Mulder, R-Sioux Falls, prime sponsor of the bill creating the law in 2024, said via text message he hasn’t heard of any other counties or agencies doing similar compliance checks. 
Representatives from local law enforcement agencies in Mulder’s city did not immediately respond to a question on whether they intend to conduct similar compliance checks.

It’s been vacant since Jan. 3, when Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet began her new job in Congress, leaving about 270,000 residents without a state senator.
Under Michigan law, only the governor has the power to call a special election to fill the seat for the remainder of the term, which runs through next year. Whitmer has not said when she’ll do so — or why it’s taken so long.
“We expect an announcement will be made in the near future,” Whitmer spokesperson Stacey LaRouche said Wednesday in a text message. “We will keep you posted.”
The governor’s office has offered variations on that statement for months but missed opportunities to utilize existing election dates to fill the seat, including Tuesday’s municipal primary.
In the meantime, the absence of a state Senator “has real consequences” for people in the district, said state Rep. Bill G. Schuette, a Midland Republican who is considering a run should Whitmer call a special election.
“We’re debating serious issues in the state Legislature, whether it’s our state’s budget, how we finally work to fix our roads … ,” he said. “People in the Great Lakes Bay region only have half of their voice.”
Schuette and other Republicans have continued to question the delay, accusing Whitmer of petty politics driven by a fear that the district will flip to Republicans.
Should it, Democrats and Republicans would each hold 19 seats in the state Senate.
Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist would have the power to break a tie, but Republicans could effectively block bills by asking a lawmaker to miss session. In the event of a 19-18 vote, a bill would fail, with no opportunity for Gilchrist to provide the 20th vote necessary for passage.
“It seems like Gov. Whitmer is very intent on doing the most political thing, because it seems like they’re afraid they’re going to lose the seat to Republicans,” said Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township. “It’s blatantly political, partisan politics that they’re playing.”
 People in the district ‘deprived of representation’

It’s not uncommon for a lawmaker to leave office before their term concludes. But Michigan’s solution — giving the governor almost absolute control to call an election with little restriction on timing — is a poor solution, experts say.
“This is an endemic problem,” said Quinn Yeargain, a professor of law at Michigan State University. “Any time there’s a vacancy and you have to have a special election, there’s going to be a period of time in which nobody is in the seat and the people are functionally deprived of representation.”
Half of U.S. states instead use some version of an appointment system — typically, where the party that previously held the seat gives names to the governor for a replacement candidate — to expedite the process.
Political appointments can appear undemocratic, Yeargain said, but they help ensure voters do not lack representation for prolonged periods.
Michigan lawmakers in recent years have tried but failed to force a timeline for filing vacant seats in the state Legislature.
Former state Rep. Andrea Schroeder introduced a bill in June 2021 that would require a governor to announce within 30 days of a vacancy whether there will be a special election to finish the term.
The bill was personal for Schroeder, a Republican from Independence Township: She had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, and she died in October of that year.
Lawmakers in the House and Senate approved the legislation, but Whitmer vetoed it, saying she would “not tie the hands of future Michigan governors.”
Schuette, the Midland Republican, introduced a similar bill this year that would require a special election within 180 days of a legislative vacancy.
The proposal was co-sponsored by 16 Republican colleagues and referred to the House Election Integrity Committee in June. The GOP-led House has yet to hold a hearing on the bill, however.
State Board of Education Chair Pamela Pugh, a Saginaw Democrat who has already filed to run for the vacant seat, said Whitmer may have a good reason for not yet calling a special election, including ongoing negotiations over the state budget and road funding talks in Lansing.
But it’s getting to the point where she needs “to bump us up on that priority list,” Pugh said, adding later: “We are asking her to prioritize us. This district. A district that has great needs.”
 The cost of a special election

A lack of clarity around when — or even if — Whitmer will call a special election also leaves local election officials in a lurch.
Whitmer could call a special election to be run outside of the standard schedule, which can prove expensive and labor-intensive for clerks who will only have a single question on the ballot.
It’s not uncommon, as both May and August local elections frequently have little on the ballot. But any election requires a lot of clerks, from the ballot design to machine testing to counting ballots, and balancing that with the many other tasks they manage can be tricky.
The governor could also call a special election to coincide with other upcoming election dates. That might be easier on clerks, but it would likely also mean the state Senate seat stays vacant into next year.
State law requires that there is first a primary, Department of State spokesperson Cheri Hardmon confirmed. It’s far too late to get the race on next week’s ballot, and the language for much of the November ballot is finalized by the middle of the month to meet state and federal requirements.
Officials in the affected counties said they haven’t heard anything about possible special election dates from the Whitmer administration or the Michigan Bureau of Elections.
It’s been “radio silence,” said Bay County Clerk Katie Zanotti, who is concerned about the potential timing.
If the election is scheduled for later this year, officials could be looking at canvassing during the holidays. If it waits until 2026, Zanotti and other local clerks could have to run four elections next year, including major statewide primary and general elections for governor, U.S. Senate, the Legislature and more.
That was “really challenging” for fellow clerks when it happened last year in Metro Detroit, said Zanotti, a Democrat.
“I wish it would have been called much, much sooner,” she said. “Otherwise, it’s going to be a mad dash if it gets called at all, and I don’t know if it’s going to be.”

Fresh off an embarrassing defeat to Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx, the state’s chief enforcers of Iowa RightThink have decided to take on someone they undoubtedly believe is more vulnerable.
The governor has filed a complaint concerning a University of Iowa employee who had the misfortune of being captured on hidden camera disparaging the anti-Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Gospel of the Republican Party.
In a secretly recorded video that aired on Fox News this week, an employee who has been identified in news reports as Andrea Tinoco, assistant director of Leadership and Student Organization Development, said that despite being ordered to remove “DEI” from their websites, “we are essentially finding ways to operate around it. … “We were like, ‘oh, OK, we can’t use that word. OK, ‘civic engagement.’ I think that’s a lot of what we’re doing.”
Civic engagement? The horrors!
In another part of the heavily edited video, Tinoco says: “We are still doing DEI work. We’re still working with our students. I have yet to be told, like, ‘Drea, you can’t say DEI,’ and I’m still gonna say it.”
Reynolds — who once said a jury’s verdict convicting Donald Trump of 34 felonies didn’t matter  — was instantly triggered by the video. She’s already pronounced Tinoco guilty of defying the state law banning diversity, equity and inclusion offices and activities. This, before the investigation was even completed; perhaps before it had even begun.
But it’s not at all clear that Tinoco has violated anything. The vaguely written law, passed in 2024, prohibits establishing offices or engaging in activities that give “special benefits” or encourage “preferential treatment” based on characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation.
Just because the adherents of Iowa RightThink get wiggy at the mere mention of “DEI,” and some university employees continue to believe in the idea behind it — equal opportunity — this doesn’t mean they are breaking the law.
Disparaging a concept, or attempts to banish it, are not illegal, either.
Nor are attempts to maneuver within the law’s meaning. Politicians do this all the time.
We’ve seen this movie before.
In February, Dan Marx violated Iowa RightThink by having the nerve to say he would uphold the Constitution, even if it meant refusing to pledge unquestioning loyalty to the federal government’s immigration practices.
These words also triggered the governor, who complained to Bird. The attorney general then tried to bring Marx to heel for what he wrote, going to court claiming he had broken state law. But Marx, a popular Republican sheriff in a Republican leaning county, chose to fight. He won.
This no doubt embarrassed Reynolds and Bird. So now they’ve chosen someone who might not have the resources or the level of public support of the elected sheriff who humiliated them. A person who they now seek to intimidate, either themselves or by leveraging the Board of Regents or the university to do it for them.
I don’t know Andrea Tinoco, but I hope she’s got access to good legal help. Because the weight of Iowa’s government is being brought to bear against her.
If she doesn’t, I hope Iowans who believe in free speech will step up.
I also hope the University of Iowa doesn’t knuckle under. We’ve already seen larger universities, with hefty financial resources, cave under the pressure of Trumpian intimidation, surrendering their free-speech values in the process. It would be a shame to see the University of Iowa join this crowd.
Here’s the bottom line: Iowans, including public employees, ought to be able to express an opinion, even if it runs against the prevailing winds of Iowa’s ruling party; even if it is expressing how you have tried to find ways, in the face of a pernicious law, to do “what we know we have to do for students.”
If this breaks the law, then Bird should have to prove it. If not, then she and the governor ought to leave people alone to say what they want in our free society.
Iowa Republicans have been on a jihad for years to try to establish RightThink in this state — by muzzling public school teachers, banning library books, seeking to impose loyalty oaths on law enforcement, etc.
If they can’t do it by law, then they’ll try to do it by intimidation. They failed with Dan Marx, so now they’ve chosen a new target. But the truth is they’re not just trying to persecute a state employee. We are all the targets of Iowa RightThink.

She climbed onto a boat mobilized by her husband, and as he steered, she held a flashlight to scout in the dark for submerged mailboxes that they might bump on their way to safety.

Though the Mendenhall River flowing by their backyard had been swollen with floodwaters in past years – and though the Lindoffs had taken precautions last summer like sealing doorways and stacking sandbags – the Aug. 5-6, 2024, event was the biggest Mendenhall Glacier outburst flood ever measured. The water that rushed out of a breached glacial ice dam brought the river to a record crest of 15.99 feet, inundating about 290 homes and stunning much of the community.

	“No one expected it to be this big,” Lindoff said months later in an interview at her freshly repaired and refurbished house.
The community is no longer likely to be caught by surprise.
“It’s probably likely that the floods could get larger in the future,” said Eran Hood, an environmental science professor and glacier specialist at the University of Alaska Southeast.
Hood is part of a broad effort mounted by scientists, government agencies, the local Tribal government, nonprofit community groups and individuals to limit the damage that may result from future floods.

By 1 p.m. that day, more than 100 cars had checked in at the Dimond Park Field House, according to city officials. Each household was allowed to fill 75 sandbags. The event, one of several held by municipal and Tribe officials, was in anticipation of another glacial outburst flood. (Photo by Corrine Smith/Alaska Beacon)
 

	A first step is ensuring that the public knows the risks. To that end, Hood and others at UAS and partner organizations have created an online resource, the Juneau Glacial Flood Dashboard, launched in May.
Though the floods glaciers produce can happen quickly, there can be early warnings of water releases. The Juneau Glacial Flood Dashboard gives real-time information on water levels pooled above the ice dam that forms each year at one of the glacier’s basins. It has weather data, aerial images and other up-to-the-minute information. One of the most important features is a detailed flood-inundation map; users can type in their addresses and get predictions for flood impacts, depending on river-level scenarios and other conditions.
The dashboard idea came up as an answer to a basic question, Hood said: “What are the best ways to communicate hazards?”
Work by Hood and his colleagues is supported by a National Science Foundation grant. The foundation funded a project to do detailed studies of Mendenhall Glacier and the flood risks it poses, hone systems for predictions and warnings and apply those tools to other flood-prone glaciers in Alaska and possibly beyond.
Outburst flooding is a natural phenomenon in glaciated areas, sometimes referred to by an Icelandic name: jökulhlaup. They occur from the Andes to the Arctic. Their suddenness can make them dangerous to people in certain parts of the world, like the Himalayas; overall, about 15 million people in the world are at risk of such floods, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Nature.
The risks are increasing with climate change and glacial melt, studies have shown. Globally, glacial lake volume increased by 48% between 1990 and 2018, according to a 2020 study by Canadian, U.S. and British scientists who used satellite imagery to make the calculations.
Alaska outburst floods
Glacial outburst floods are also natural in Alaska, though the trends are a bit different.
There were 1,150 of these outbursts released from 106 ice-dammed lakes between 1985 and 2020, according to a study published in 2023 by scientists from Colorado State University, the University of Alaska Fairbanks and other institutions. The frequency of such events was unchanged over that period, they found. But there was a big change in timing, with most of the sites flooding earlier in the year, likely the result of warming temperatures and faster melt, the study found. Rapid changes in glaciers’ structures also means that new water-filled dams — and new flood risks — are emerging at individual sites, the study said.

Alaska’s glaciers are melting faster than those elsewhere in the world. The melt has varied and sometimes contradictory impacts on outburst floods, the 2023 study explains. Less ice overall has meant a reduced supply of meltwater. But accelerated melt can also increase the size of glaciers’ basins and weaken the ice dams that hold their meltwater. Rapid melt can also cause huge chunks of ice to calve away from higher elevations into the basins, boosting volume quickly.

Most of Alaska’s outburst floods have occurred in remote areas where there are no immediate threats to communities, like parts of sprawling Wrangell St-Elias National Park.
The Mendenhall Valley, however, is not remote.
The broad valley was carved into the landscape over millennia by its namesake glacier. It is a major suburb of Alaska’s capital city, home to about 12,000 of Juneau’s 31,200 residents. It holds neat neighborhoods where houses are more spacious than in the city’s upscale but tightly packed downtown district. It also holds abundant parks and trails, scenic views of mountains, meadows and coastline; and conveniences like shopping malls and commuter bus service. And, within the Tongass National Forest that surrounds the city, the valley is known for the big glacier that looms over it and draws hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.
Mendenhall Glacier has ebbed and flowed over thousands of years, but it has been in retreat ever since the Little Ice Age ended in the mid-1700s. As the climate has warmed — a trend amplified in far-north latitudes — the retreat has accelerated. That is the case not just for Mendenhall but for the other glaciers connected to the vast Juneau Ice Field that caps the mountains spanning Southeast Alaska and adjacent parts of Canada. The Juneau Ice Field lost a tenth of its glacier area from 2005 to 2019, according to NASA.
This melt created a relatively new gap within Mendenhall’s ice called Suicide Basin, reportedly named after the drop that ice above the basin would experience. Retreat of the smaller Suicide Glacier, which had been connected to Mendenhall, created the gap.
As glacial ice melts over each summer, the basin fills with water. As the water within the basin rises, it breaks through the ice dam and rushes down into Mendenhall Lake, Mendenhall River and, sometimes, over the riverbanks. The process is repeated year-to-year as ice dams are formed and then breached, though water amounts and speed of releases can vary.
Had modern technology and alertness existed in the past, the risk to the Mendenhall Valley could have been identified many years ago, Hood said.

	“Twenty years ago, someone could have looked at Mendenhall and looked at the side basins and said there could definitely be a problem in the future. Nobody did that,” he said.
The first Suicide Basin outburst flood was in 2011. “That pretty much caught people by surprise, although in hindsight, it shouldn’t have,” said Jason Amundson, a UAS geophysics professor and the principal investigator for the National Science Foundation-funded project.
Since then, floods have occurred almost annually, though at varying levels and intensities. Recent floods were big. A record 2023 flood, with a maximum crest of the Mendenhall River measured at 14.97 feet, was followed by the even-bigger 2024 flood.
Though it caused more damage, last year’s flood came and went quickly. “The whole thing lasted maybe 12 hours,” Amundson said..

There is not yet enough data to identify a clear pattern, making predictions difficult for now, Hood and Amundson said. But there is a good chance that Suicide Basin will continue emptying out huge amounts of water.
“If we keep having full drainage like we did last year, then I would expect that we would keep having big floods,” Amundson said.
Local officials, meanwhile, are looking beyond Suicide Basin as they consider future risks, said Robert Barr, Juneau’s assistant city manager.
“There very well could be other basins behind Suicide that will form as Mendenhall Glacier retreats,” he said.
Holding waters back
The municipal government, a partner in the flood dashboard, has embarked on another short-term response to the flood risk.

	It spent nearly $8 million on a flood barrier erected this year along the Mendenhall River. The barrier, a stout sandbag structure originally designed for military use, was recommended by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a short-term fix. To recoup part of the cost, the local government is assessing a fee on the 466 property owners in the river area. The fee, about $6,300 per household, is to be paid over 10 years.
The Lindoff home is among those behind the new barrier, which bears the brand name HESCO. Danielle Lindoff, who has watched river waters rise and churn over the years, eroding the far bank and felling huge trees, said she is grateful for the protection. But her feelings are mixed.
“We bought this house because of the view,” she said. “Now we won’t even be able to see it.”
Barr, at the City and Borough of Juneau, concedes the barriers are not particularly pretty. But he said most homeowners accept their presence.
“I wouldn’t say the question was, ‘Do you find the HESCO barriers attractive or not?’” he said. “But they are our best effort, in consultation with the Army Corps and all the other experts that we’re talking with, to keep water in the river.”

	The barriers are temporary, Barr said.
For the longer term, the Army Corps of Engineers might design a bigger flood-control system, he said. That could be something as substantial as the diversion project installed in Fairbanks after a devastating 1967 flood. The Fairbanks system is large, subject to ongoing maintenance, and has cost $220 million to date. The Corps has already embarked on a technical study for the Mendenhall Valley, a project supported by $4.75 million in federal funds.

It is possible that the Corps will create something similar for Juneau’s Mendenhall Valley. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)

Whatever is done will depend on scientific research.
The University of Alaska Southeast-led team, which also includes scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Carnegie Mellon University, is using field and remote-sensing data to better understand how the glacier has changed in the past and to create models for how it will change in the future. Technologies used include LiDAR, which measures elevations and features through light beams; radar, which employs soundwaves to measure the thickness of glacial ice over bedrock; and drones, which capture aerial images that can be compared over time.
 


	Weather and tide data is important, too. The record 2024 outburst flood came on a night after a gloriously sunny and warm summer day. Things could be much worse if an outburst flood happens during a rainstorm or when tides in the adjacent Gastineau Channel are exceptionally high, experts say.
Beyond Juneau
The Mendenhall work being led by Amundson is about more than Juneau’s famous glacier. The risk-analysis systems the team develops for Mendenhall are intended to be applied to other glaciers in Alaska.
Beyond Mendenhall, Hood said, the second-highest priority for risk analysis is probably Snow Glacier on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage and just north of the coastal town of Seward.

	Though the Snow Glacier’s periodic floods have not reached communities beyond a popular campground and a smattering of nearby houses, they do threaten infrastructure. The Seward Highway, a major state thoroughfare, and the Alaska Railroad run right along that flood zone. The railroad is planning to raise the elevation of a bridge at the trouble site, and the Alaska Department of Transportation plans a related elevation rise to the highway. The estimated cost of the road project alone is $20 million.

	Hood and Amundson pointed out another spot where glacial outburst floods are threats: the Prince William Sound port town of Valdez, home to 3,900 people and site of the terminal where oil that passes through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System is shipped out.
In the mountains outside of town, the Valdez Glacier has been damming and releasing meltwater every year or two. Some years, releases are relatively slow and small; some years’ releases cause problems. An outburst flood in 2018 inundated part of Valdez.
Weakened federal partners?
Continued work to understand glacial outburst floods and the risks they pose to Alaskans depends on partnerships with academic institutions and agencies at various levels of government.
But federal agencies that are important partners have been weakened by deep budget cuts and abrupt firings that could hollow out scientific programs.
One partner is the U.S. Geological Survey, a branch of the Department of the Interior that has been doing both long-term monitoring of Mendenhall Glacier’s changes and collecting day-to-day data and imagery from Suicide Basin. The Trump administration is proposing slashing total USGS spending by nearly 40%, including an approximately 30% cut to the agency’s natural disaster programs.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, is another key partner that has already been targeted for deep cuts and likely faces more. The administration’s budget for the coming fiscal years proposes eliminating all funding for NOAA research.
The U.S. Forest Service is another partner. It manages the Tongass National Forest, which covers most of Southeast Alaska, and Southcentral Alaska’s Chugach National Forest. Both are heavily glaciated.

	Among the Forest Service duties in Juneau is delivery of warnings and, at times, evacuation notices to tourists and campers at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center. Mass firings by the Trump administration left the visitor center nearly unmanned earlier in the year, with only two employees still on the payroll there in February. Several workers have been rehired since, but staffing levels remain uncertain.
Barr said Juneau officials worry about losses at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, an important partner even though its general definition of flood zones does not consider glacial outburst floods.
The agency in April canceled its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, and halted work on all pending grant applications, even though the program has won praise for helping communities reduce costs of disaster emergencies.
Several states are pushing back against the program’s termination; 20 filed a lawsuit in mid-July challenging the administration’s decision.
“We are potentially concerned about hazard-mitigation grants and those going away,” Barr said. And along with loss of financial aid is the concern about “losing expertise” as veteran emergency and risk-assessment experts are pushed out of the agency, he said.
Uncertainty also affects the National Science Foundation, which is funding the Mendenhall research project. The Trump administration is proposing a 55 percent cut for the coming fiscal year.
The grant money was already paid, and so far, the project has remained intact, Amundson said. “As far as I know, everything is going forward,” he said.

,California,2025-08-02 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California affordable housing programs are on the chopping block after Supreme Court ruling,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/08/affordable-housing-developer-fees/,Many California cities require homebuilders to create affordable housing or pay fees to support construction of those units. A new lawsuit contends those fees are unconstitutional.,"In summary
Many California cities require homebuilders to create affordable housing or pay fees to support construction of those units. A new lawsuit contends those fees are unconstitutional.


East Palo Alto, like cities across California, has a law on the books that forces developers of new housing projects to foot the bill for the state’s shortage of affordable homes.
New residential projects need to set aside a share of the units they plan to build for lower-income renters and homeowners under the terms of the city’s “inclusionary zoning” ordinance. Builders who refuse have to instead pay a fee, ranging from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
An East Palo Alto homeowner filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday challenging the constitutionality of that law, likening it to “extortion” — and he had a little help from the U.S. Supreme Court.
The implications of the lawsuit range far beyond the Bay Area. A 2017 report estimated that 149 cities and counties across California have some form of inclusionary zoning rule, though the specific terms vary. That makes it one of the most commonly used affordable housing programs both in California and in the country. 
Now all that may be on the constitutional chopping block.
The case was filed in federal court in San Francisco by Wesley Yu, a husband and father between jobs, who was planning to build a home and backyard guest cottage for himself and his extended family on a neighboring parcel.
Because Yu was planning to construct two new structures, the city’s inclusionary zoning rules kicked in, requiring him to either sell or rent out one of the units at “affordable” rates or to pay a one-time fee of $54,891 to be deposited in the city’s affordable housing subsidy fund.
The core of Yu’s lawsuit, which was filed by the libertarian-oriented Pacific Legal Foundation, draws on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from last year that also emerged from a heated California housing dispute. 
That case was brought by Placerville septuagenarian, George Sheetz, who contested that the government of El Dorado County had not done enough to justify the $23,420 traffic fee it placed on his home construction project.
Sheetz’s case drew on the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which puts limits on when the government can take private property. Decades of court rulings have said that if a local government wants to base approval of a construction permit on certain conditions, those conditions have to directly relate to the costs associated with the development. A city, for example, might be able to hold off on approving a new dump until a developer pays an environmental clean up fee, but not a fee to fund local arts and recreation. 
Courts have also ruled that such “exactions” on private development should be “roughly proportionate” to their cost. That is, the $23,420 that El Dorado County wanted to impose on Sheetz should match the cost of fixing the wear and tear his new home would leave on local roads.
The Supreme Court agreed that these standards ought to apply to the impact fee.
Now Yu and his legal team are asking a federal judge to apply that same rule to inclusionary zoning. For East Palo Alto’s program to pass constitutional muster, the city would have to show that the $54,891 fee or the requirement to set aside new units at a discount relates to and matches the cost that Yu’s development would impose upon the city.
The city won’t be able to show that, said David Deerson, the lead lawyer representing Yu.
“New residential development doesn’t have a negative impact on housing affordability. If anything, it has a positive impact,” he said.
A growing body of economic research has indeed found that local market-rate development puts downward pressure on neighborhood and city-wide rents.
Affordable housing in California zoning
In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto. Requiring private developers to toss in some added affordable housing isn’t an “exaction,” the courts have found, but a standard land-use restriction akin to any other zoning rule. 
Whether a city decides it needs more schools, apartment buildings, businesses or, in the case of inclusionary zoning, affordable housing, it has broad power under the constitution to “decide, for the good of the general welfare, that we’re going to require this,” said Mike Rawson, director of litigation at the Public Interest Law Project. 
The state Supreme Court ruled as such most recently in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to weigh in, a tacit approval. 
“They can always change their mind,” said Rawson. “I don’t see a basis for it, though obviously that doesn’t necessarily stop them.”
The composition of the court has changed since 2015, veering sharply to the right. The Sheetz decision from last year has offered new fodder for legal challenges to inclusionary zoning.
“Sheetz really helps out here a lot” in that campaign, said Deerson. He pointed to other challenges in Denver and Teton County, Wyoming. “I would expect them to keep coming.”
Tradeoffs in housing policy
If and when the nation’s highest court takes up the issue of inclusionary zoning, it will be wading into one of the more politically charged debates in housing policy.
Evidence on the impact of these laws is mixed. Requiring private developers to build affordable units can and regularly does result in more local housing options for lower income tenants at no additional cost to taxpayers. By putting affordable and market-rate units side-by-side, they also promote economic and racial integration, supporters argue. 
But inclusionary requirements can also make any given housing project less profitable, meaning that fewer units get built, leading to higher prices and rents overall. In housing markets, like California’s, that see relatively little new development, the rate at which these programs add designated affordable units to the housing stock is also quite slow.
That policy debate isn’t relevant to the legal case, which will be fought and won over abstract constitutional principles. But for libertarian-leaning groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, building industry groups and many “Yes In My Backyard” housing development advocates, an end to inclusionary zoning would be a win on both fronts.
“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012425-Affordable-Housing-DD-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-02 09:56:11.407167

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As the Trump administration shrinks and even considers eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Alaska Legislature is considering a substitute for one of the agency’s key functions.
A bill introduced by Sen. Bert Stedman, a Republican from the Southeast city of Sitka, would establish an Alaska flood authority and an Alaska flood insurance fund. As far as he knows, it would make Alaska the only state with its own flood insurance, Stedman said.
The veteran state lawmaker said his measure, Senate Bill 11, stems from his dissatisfaction with FEMA and its flood policies, feelings that predated the agency’s possible demise in the Trump era.
The federal agency is, for now, the only source of flood insurance in Alaska, as private carriers that offer policies elsewhere in the country do not operate in the state’s small market, Stedman said.
But Alaskans overall pay much more into the FEMA insurance pool that they receive, he said.
“There’s a cost factor involved here, with Alaska residents subsidizing the Mississippi Delta and the Gulf Coast and East Coast and all that compared to our losses,” Stedman said.
FEMA’s rules about insurance and assistance, which are aimed at flood-prone flat Lower 48 areas, are another source of irritation for Stedman. In Lower 48 areas, FEMA encourages communities to avoid building along coastlines, but in Southeast Alaska, where steep mountains rise from the water’s edge, there are few options for moving inland, he said. An only-in-Alaska flood program could consider local conditions and local governments’ zoning rules rather than FEMA national guidelines, he said.
The Trump administration’s antipathy toward FEMA and its mission has given his bill more urgency, he said.
“It’s reasonably likely that there’ll be significant changes to FEMA coming out of Washington, from restructuring to possibly elimination, so the timing of this bill might be, by happenstance, timely,” he said.
The bill moved through committees this year and is due for more work next year’s session, including an examination of funding options. If a system is established, Stedman said, it could potentially be expanded to another type of disaster that is occurring with increasing frequency in warming Alaska: landslides. There is no specific landslide insurance available in Alaska, Stedman noted.
That may be of interest to Jason Amundson and Eran Hood, University of Alaska Southeast scientists who are focused on glacial outburst flood risks. Though immersed in their project at Mendenhall Glacier, they do not live in the path of the meltwater. Rather, both live in the city’s downtown area, which clings to the lower slopes of steep mountains. There, avalanches and landslides pose the most serious risks.
“There’s hazards everywhere in Juneau,” Hood said.

GADSDEN — The coal ash lagoon at Alabama Power’s Plant Gadsden was supposed to be a model for how to close ash ponds by covering them in place, a process utilities insisted would protect human health and the environment from toxic contaminants in the ash.
Now, groundwater monitoring data and a federal lawsuit are challenging that contention.
The ash pond was the first in Alabama to be closed with a cover-in-place system in 2018, after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2015 coal ash rules, and Alabama Power planned to use the same basic technique at the coal ash ponds for five other power plants across the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But today, seven years after the Gadsden pond closure was completed, environmental groups say the facility is still leaking toxic substances into groundwater on the banks of the Coosa River and Neely Henry Lake, a popular boating and bass fishing destination in east Alabama.
The Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of environmental group Coosa Riverkeeper, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Alabama Power, challenging what it called “unlawful and defective capping” of the coal ash pond at Plant Gadsden.
The groups say that as recently as October 2024, Alabama Power’s self-reported groundwater monitoring results show “levels of arsenic forty times the legal standard in groundwater,” as well as potentially harmful levels of boron, chromium and cobalt.
“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”
Coosa Riverkeeper is among numerous groups that have called for Alabama Power to excavate its coal ash and move the material to a lined landfill, rather than leaving the ash in unlined impoundments near rivers. Alabama Power has announced plans to cap all of its coal ash ponds in place, but Gadsden is the only plant where that process has been completed.
“It’s time for Alabama Power to do the right thing and move their ash,” Overton said.
A spokesperson for Alabama Power said “[a]s a matter of practice, we do not comment on pending legal matters.”
Coal ash, or coal combustion residuals, are the leftover solid material from burning coal, typically in a power plant or other industrial facility. According to the EPA, coal ash often contains contaminants like mercury, cadmium, chromium and arsenic which can be “associated with cancer and various other serious health effects.”
The EPA’s 2015 coal ash rules allowed for two possible cleanup options for the coal ash lagoons, which can be hundreds of acres in size, containing millions of tons of wet ash slurry. Utilities could dig out the coal ash and move it to a lined landfill, or they could cover it in place, as long as certain conditions were met.
In 2016, Alabama Power announced plans to use the cover-in-place option at all its plants. The permit for Plant Gadsden was approved by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management in 2020, two years after the physical work had already been completed.
But last year, the EPA denied approval of Alabama’s coal ash permitting program, saying that the state had approved permits that were “significantly less protective of people and waterways than federal law requires,” and that “coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure.”
The Riverkeeper lawsuit—filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama—contends that nearly 40 percent of the ash at Gadsden remains saturated in groundwater, constituting a violation of the EPA coal ash rules and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
It is not yet clear how the coal ash regulations will fare under the Trump administration.
The groups filed a notice of intent to sue in May, and went forward with the suit Tuesday, after the required 60-day notification period.
In addition to the lake being a popular fishing spot, the ash pond is located less than a mile upstream of a drinking water intake, although the lawsuit does not allege any contamination of the drinking water.
The coal ash pond at Plant Gadsden is on the opposite side of the river from the old power plant, which was demolished last year. According to the lawsuit, the coal ash slurry was pumped through underwater pipes across the river for disposal in a lagoon.
“There is no excuse for a company with Alabama Power’s resources to risk a community and commercial riverfront with this type of hazard,” Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office, said in a news release. “Alabama Power must join utilities across the South cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps. This type of waste must be in safe storage away from waterways like the Coosa and Neely Henry Lake.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Coal-ash-pond-for-Aug-2-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 08:56:11.654961

(Photo by Emree Weaver for InvestigateWest)Throughout her two decades working on forestry issues, Jasmine Minbashian has often found herself at odds with the U.S. Forest Service and the timber industry. Her environmental activism started during the second wave of Pacific Northwest “Timber Wars” — an intense period of conflict between environmentalists and the timber industry that unfolded in the late 1980s and ’90s over logging in old-growth forests.
Instead of camping out in century-old trees or destroying timber-felling equipment in protest of sweeping logging practices on public lands, Minbashian took a different approach. She worked to bring disparate groups together to restore old-growth forests, supporting rural economies and reducing wildfire risk at the same time. 
So when she joined the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative in 2019, Minbashian felt cautiously optimistic. The organization — one of dozens of forest collaboratives that had sprung up across the West — brought together conservation groups, agency officials and timber companies to plan forest restoration projects in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. As the executive director of the small environmental nonprofit Methow Valley Citizens Council, she was excited to have a seat at the table to find common ground.
One of the group’s first major efforts focused on restoring 50,000 fire-prone acres near Twisp, the rural town where she lived. For years, the group collaborated closely with the U.S. Forest Service to design the Mission Restoration Project and garner community support. The plan included some commercial logging, but largely focused on thinning small trees, restoring habitat and decommissioning old roads — work Minbashian believed could protect communities without resorting to the kind of aggressive logging she had spent years fighting.
But when no timber companies bid on the commercial logging portion of the project, federal and state agencies quietly rewrote the plan to, as Minbashian put it, “sweeten the pot” by including more large trees — circumventing years of planning, environmental assessments and community outreach. The $1.1 million contract was ultimately awarded in 2021 to Hampton Lumber, a member of the collaborative, which trucked the logs more than 100 miles to its mill on the other side of the Cascades.
“That started some of the questioning of, like, what’s going on here?” Minbashian said.
When she later visited logged areas near the Libby and Buttermilk creek drainages, she was stunned. Some sections looked as expected. Others had been stripped of trees she thought were protected by the restoration project plan — including old-growth trees that are key to the forest’s health.
“When you’re talking about restoring forests and climate-smart forestry, you want to retain those old or big trees,” she said. “They’re the most fire-resistant. They store water. They just serve so many important ecological functions.”
Over the last decade, hundreds of millions of private, state and federal dollars have been funneled to forest restoration and wildfire mitigation projects spearheaded by the U.S. Forest Service and collaborative groups like the one in North Central Washington. The group is one of 19 forest collaboratives focused on public lands in Washington and Oregon that emerged in the wake of the “Timber Wars” in an attempt to find agreement around contentious forestry issues. 
These forest collaboratives, touted as a model of consensus-driven conservation, have quietly become influential engines for federal forest management decisions across the West. But critics worry the groups are too aligned with timber interests that prioritize commercial logging, and that they helped pave the way for the Trump administration’s latest effort to expand logging on public lands throughout the country by skirting environmental protection laws.
Some community groups and grassroots environmental organizations have become disenchanted with the arrangement, saying forest collaboratives offer a false sense of community engagement and transparency into forestry projects on public lands. Other mainstream environmental groups see timber’s influence in the projects as a double-edged sword. While the commercial logging aspects of the projects are often the most controversial, the timber sale can help fund other aspects of the restoration plans — like improving fish spawning areas and decommissioning roads that fragment wildlife habitats — to help keep the momentum going. But those funds aren’t always guaranteed.
“Everybody’s at the table because they have their own interests,” said Tiana Luke, the co-chair of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative and the senior conservation manager for The Wilderness Society, a national environmental policy nonprofit. “In this climate, we can’t do the important ecological forest restoration without that economic component.”
Unlike some forest collaboratives, the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative is not classified formally as a federal advisory committee, meaning the group isn’t required to follow accountability and transparency measures meant to limit the influence of special interest groups on public policy. 


The collaborative insists that it wields the same influence as any other community member when making suggestions to the Forest Service. But years worth of internal documents and emails obtained by InvestigateWest show the group has worked closely with the U.S. Forest Service at nearly every step of the process to carefully craft public messaging around logging projects, placate community concerns, and keep projects on pace and out of the courts. For at least one project, records show that a bid was awarded to the same timber company that had previously led a discussion among collaborative members about how to make the project more attractive to buyers. 
“It’s all because they want to rush the projects through,” said Ric Bailey, a Winthrop resident and a longtime environmental activist. “They’re showing the public, look, we are doing something to protect you from fire.”
But he sees no difference in the current approach to what he witnessed in the ’80s and ’90s, when the Forest Service’s main priority was meeting federally mandated timber quotas. 
“I looked at the projects, and I said, ‘These don’t have anything to do with fire or fuel reductions,’” he recalled thinking, referring to the Mission Restoration Project. “It’s just logging.” 
Public plans versus reality
In the wake of the Timber Wars, forest collaboratives emerged to bring lumber mill owners, environmentalists and local governments to the table to figure out how to move forward. Public perception had begun to move away from viewing national forests as “piggy banks” for economic benefit and resource extraction to treating them as ecological treasures worthy of protection, according to Steve Pedery, the conservation director at Oregon Wild, a Portland-based environmental organization that helped create some of the first collaboratives. 
But over the last decade, the pendulum has swung back toward timber interests, according to Pedery.
“There are still places where you will find functional collaboratives and their citizens who come together with loggers and the Forest Service and counties and community groups to hash out a common vision,” Pedery said. “But I would say that’s the rarity these days.” 
Pedery feels mainstream environmental groups participating in forest collaboratives have compromised their values in exchange for access to funding and a seat at the decision-making table — a dynamic that’s helped set the stage for the Trump administration’s current efforts to expand and expedite logging in national forests by 25%.
“There are a lot of people who had a little too much hubris over the last decade who helped create this mess that we’re in around losing what are really some of the existential environmental protections in the Pacific Northwest,” he said. 
The Trump administration claims that, in addition to reducing the country’s reliance on domestic timber, recent actions to expedite logging operations will improve forest health and reduce the risk of catastrophic fire by thinning out overgrown forests. But some legal experts and environmental scientists warn that while some thinning could help, excessive logging could have the opposite effect by creating drier conditions, altering forest structures to make them less resilient and increasing flammable logging “debris” across the landscape.
While many of the restoration projects being spearheaded by the Forest Service and the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative call for ecological restoration efforts aside from logging, those aspects often lag behind — calling into question whether the restoration plans are simply commercial logging under a different name. 
“Typically in the past, what would happen is that the commercial part would get done, but all the stuff that needed funding would not get done,” Minbashian told InvestigateWest in February. “So even though they did the (environmental assessment) for it, it doesn’t mean it necessarily happened.” 
That’s been true for the Mission Project, where 95% of the commercial thinning outlined in the environmental assessment has been completed as of June 2025; 69% of noncommercial thinning has been completed; and less than 5% of the planned prescribed burning has occurred as of July 2025, according to a Forest Service spokesperson. Only a quarter of fish culverts have been replaced, though 80% of the planned habitat improvement plans for streams have occurred. 
The collaborative, founded in 2013, gained momentum in the wake of two catastrophic wildfire seasons in North Central Washington — a time often cited in press releases and scientific reports as highlighting the need for restoration work.
On a windy, hot day in July 2014, lightning strikes ignited the Carlton Complex Fire, which went down in state history as the largest continuous wildfire, engulfing more than 250,000 acres, destroying over 350 homes, and leaving $98 million worth of damage in its wake. The following year, another million acres burned in the area, leading to renewed public outcry from residents wanting to see more done to prevent wildfires. 
“When people talk about the trauma of that fire event, and then the 2015 fires that devastated a huge area of Okanogan County, it’s real,” said Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist for the University of Washington whose family lived through the fire. “I can still choke up about it.”
As wildfires in the Pacific Northwest have become more frequent and more devastating, collaboratives like those in Washington have become increasingly vocal about the urgency of improving the ecosystem and addressing the long legacy of fire suppression from the U.S. Forest Service, which led to a buildup of “wildfire fuels” across the landscape.
For centuries, Indigenous people stewarded forests by thinning and resetting the landscape using fire, which is critical to ecosystem health. But the U.S. Forest Service’s longstanding practice of aggressive fire suppression led to a buildup of dense, dry forests, primed to burn. The resulting catastrophic wildfires triggered an influx of state and federal funds for “fuel reduction treatments” such as forest thinning — a broad term which can mean removing small branches and trees or conducting massive commercial logging projects — as well as prescribed burning.
“Fire is such a big component of the ecology of the forest here, and they have been historically fire-suppressed, and so we need to reintroduce fire,” Minbashian said. “But if you did that without some thinning first, it could lead to bigger fires than we want, which is what we’re seeing because of climate change as well.”
“Some thinning prior to fire can be helpful, but thinning alone is not going to get you the results you need,” she added. 
Tools meant to speed up the process
A major goal of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative is to speed up the approval process for restoration projects, which is made easier if the project is proposed to help address wildfire risks. 
To do so, the group pays private consultants to conduct environmental studies and surveys on behalf of the Forest Service in an attempt to circumvent federal bureaucracy. It also relies on condition-based management, a tool which allows the group to get planning approvals based on a broad-strokes outline of a decision, with the promise that the details will get hammered out later. But the practices also obfuscate the plans for the public and make it harder for environmental groups to sue, advocates say. And since the collaborative is part of the planning process so early on, it gives timber industry representatives who are part of the group a front-row seat to million-dollar timber sales they might ultimately bid on. 
During the planning phase for the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s first project, called the Upper Wenatchee Restoration project, Anjolene Price, the collaborative forestry manager for Hampton Lumber, led discussions within a subcommittee about how to design the project to entice buyers while remaining “cautious of anti-trust violations,” according to meeting notes obtained by InvestigateWest. Anti-trust laws are meant to promote fair competition and prohibit activity like price-fixing, bid-rigging and monopolization. 

Hampton Lumber ultimately received a $1.5 million timber contract in 2024, the first commercial sale awarded for the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project.
Price represents Hampton Lumber on several forest collaboratives in Washington, driving hundreds of miles each week to attend in-person meetings. In 2022, she became the co-chair of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative. 
With sawmills in Washington, Oregon and Canada, Hampton Lumber has the largest forestry footprint in Okanogan County and the second largest in the state of Washington. Over the last decade, the company has received $443 million worth of timber contracts to conduct logging on state-managed lands throughout the state. The company has completed five timber sales in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest since 2021 – including at least three projects that Price helped to design – accounting for nearly 58% of all the timber removed from the federally-managed forest, according to data obtained from the Washington Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Forest Service. 
“When it comes to collaboratives and forest health treatment projects, it would be more difficult, even inappropriate, if the local mills were not involved,” Price, who declined numerous interview requests, wrote in a prepared statement. 
“The success of these projects depends on finding markets for any wood fiber that is removed; ultimately, the forest health treatment must pencil out in order to be implemented,” she wrote. “By participating, I can help inform what will work and what does not.”
The collaborative doesn’t define what would be considered a conflict of interest in its operating procedures, and some members within the group insist that no such conflict exists since all parties benefit in some way from the project. 
The group also doesn’t define what success looks like for the projects.
Luke, the co-chair of the collaborative and the senior conservation manager for the Wilderness Society, said it’s challenging to quantify the group’s successes over the last decade. The projects are complicated, span decades, and involve dozens of state and federal agencies and outside groups to pull off, she said. 
Personally, she’d like to see more monitoring happening to help answer that million-dollar question: Are these projects actually helping the environment? 
“Are we reducing the risk of crown fire in this stand or across the landscape as a whole?” said Luke, referring to wildfires that quickly spread through the “crown” or tops of trees. 
“If you look at a broader scale, are we doing that?” she added. “And sometimes the forest has funding and capacity to do that (monitoring), and then sometimes they don’t.”
In the final environmental assessment for the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project published in 2017, the Forest Service said it was working with partners to develop a “broad monitoring strategy” to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and restoration actions. “While this strategy is still in development, it is expected to result in a monitoring partnership with collaborators and regular reporting of monitoring results,” the plans read. 
The North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s website says it is spearheading that effort, but Luke said questions about monitoring should be directed to the Forest Service. In response, a Forest Service spokesperson wrote in an email that they are collecting data on vegetation density and the size of trees within the areas that will be logged. “The Forest Service is coordinating closely with NCWFHC to inform future implementation strategies and adaptive management,” she said.
Still, the collaborative is celebrating the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project as a success.
In May, a group of around 40 community members piled into two white Forest Service vans to visit a slice of the forest where the project took place, outside Leavenworth. 
Standing in a semi-circle in the middle of a recently logged area of the forest, the tour group was a mix of forestry experts and retirees — many of whom live along Lake Wenatchee, one of the most wildfire-prone areas in the country. Those involved in the project celebrated their decade-long collaboration, declaring that the nearby community was better protected from wildfire because of the work done. 
“We did it,” said Lloyd McGee, a founding member of the collaborative and the Washington forests program manager for the nonprofit The Nature Conservancy, as the crowd clapped. “We didn’t increase the pace, but we’re still learning from that.”
The project originally listed many of the same ecological goals as the Mission Project, such as decommissioning roads, restoring fish habitat and conducting prescribed burning — but much of the work remains incomplete, apart from two timber sales. Approximately 2,300 acres have been sold for commercial logging, with about 30% of the logging having been completed as of July 2025, according to a Forest Service spokesperson. Only a small fraction of the noncommercial thinning has occurred, and no prescribed burning or road decommissioning has taken place. 
“Maybe that’s step two or three,” Andrew Lakota, a staff member with the Wenatchee River Ranger District who helped steward the logging operations for the project, told the crowd. “I don’t know what step that is, but now we’re generating receipts from the timber, and we can start doing a lot of other (restoration) activities we identified.”
Public cut out of the process
When Ric Bailey moved to North Central Washington’s Methow Valley in 2014, tucked in the eastern foothills of the Cascade Range, he was hoping to retire. 
With the help of a local carpenter, he built a small yurt-style home just outside downtown Winthrop — 12 minutes from the edge of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. After decades of environmental activism to stop logging in old-growth forests and wilderness areas throughout the Pacific Northwest, Bailey was burned out and yearned for some stillness. But it wasn’t long before he found himself fighting the same fights. 
Bailey, alongside a small but mighty group of neighbors, has been critical of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s behind-the-scenes role in crafting Forest Service projects, often years before community members have a chance to weigh in. They see the setup as nothing more than a mirage, offering the illusion of transparency and community engagement into plans that do nothing more than pad the profits of powerful timber companies.
“All we can do is document how they have cut the public out of the process,” Bailey said. “Once these (environmental assessments) are signed, all you got is litigation.”

The Forest Service isn’t required to listen to the collaborative’s recommendations, but they often do. Any citizen can submit a proposal for consideration during the agency’s environmental review, but the collaborative knows months — and even years — before the public knows what the project might look like, including how much timber companies might get. Unlike members of the public, collaboratives also work hand and hand with the federal agency to iron out the details. 
For example, in 2020, the Forest Service gave collaborative members a three-week “sneak peek” of a final environmental assessment for a contentious restoration project before it was released to the public for a 30-day comment period, according to emails obtained by InvestigateWest.
“They get a front-row seat,” Bailey said.
While the group’s quarterly meetings are open to the public, community members are not permitted in steering committee meetings or a project working group, where collaborative members discuss pending Forest Service projects and current collaborations on public lands. 
Meeting notes are also only sporadically posted online. The most recent quarterly meeting minutes available are from November 2024, the only notes posted since 2021 — though the new facilitator of the group said the lag is due to website issues.
Bailey and other community members have criticized the group for being insular, saying it contradicts their publicly stated goals of engaging the community on public projects. 
“There’s sensitivity on how we talk about work of the collaborative,” Price, the co-chair of the collaborative and Hampton Lumber representative, told members during a meeting in February in which she reiterated the group’s policy of directing media inquiries to the co-chairs. “We don’t want to be knocking ourselves.”
Bailey is also critical of the ways the Forest Service, with help from the collaborative, is trying to expedite “restoration” projects by speeding up the environmental review process using tools now openly championed by the Trump administration under the guise of wildfire mitigation. The tools include finding “flexible ways” to write environmental assessments that leave ample room for different interpretations on the ground. Those strategies also make it more difficult to sue, he said. 
Each project must be reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a landmark 1970 environmental law that requires federal agencies to assess whether an action will have a significant impact on the environment before a project is approved. But there are various levels of review, and the agency gets to determine which is the most appropriate. The Forest Service determined that the second-narrowest environmental review — for projects they consider to have no significant impact on the environment — sufficed for over 200,000 acres encompassed in the four major restoration projects unfolding in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. 
“How can you say that you’re going to reduce wildfire risk and reconstruct the forest, the whole forest ecosystem here, and not have a significant environmental impact?” Bailey said. “Are you kidding me?”
Restoration projects are also set to undergo even less review under the Trump administration. In an executive order issued in March, the Trump administration ordered agencies to expand the use of categorical exclusions, the least stringent type of environmental review, and to exempt timber thinning projects entirely to expedite logging throughout the country’s national forests.
While Prichard, the forest ecologist with the University of Washington, sees commercial logging as a necessary tool to thin out the forest and reduce wildfire risks, she remains cautious. “I’ve become more comfortable with the idea that we need mills to take the material out and help defray the very expensive cost of fire exclusion,” she said.
“Do I think that we should be really careful about next steps and provide a lot of oversight? Absolutely,” she said, referring to Trump’s executive orders regarding logging. “But the term commercial harvesting doesn’t set my hackles up the way it might some of my neighbors.”
Bailey isn’t opposed to fuel reduction projects like noncommercial thinning or even logging, if done thoughtfully. He’s worked on Forest Service projects and as a timber faller in the ’80s, and later as a wildland firefighter. But he takes issue with the collaborative and the Forest Service offering false hope to people that the projects will protect them from fire without providing the evidence to support their claims.  
“It’s a big smoke screen,” he said.
Bailey’s small community group celebrated a win in May. A federal court partially ruled in favor of an environmental group that had challenged the environmental assessment for another project the collaborative is working on, the 24,000-acre Twisp Restoration Project.
The court didn’t completely shut down the logging being done by Hampton Lumber, but paused it until the Forest Service could examine what cumulative effects the project might have on the landscape. The initial environmental assessment stated that the project would have “no substantial impact” on the environment. 
“It’s something,” Bailey said. “We will take it.”
But the timber industry also took it as a partial win. The ruling upheld “condition-based management,” the tool that was used to justify the increased logging for the Mission Project, setting an “excellent precedent,” Tom Partin, the president of the American Forest Resource Council, told fellow collaborative members during a meeting in June.
‘That’s a whole new variable’
Minbashian hasn’t completely lost faith in the collaborative process or the Forest Service. 
After her organization produced a monitoring report of the trees that were cut for the Mission Project, the Forest Service acknowledged that some of the logging didn’t go as planned and issued a statement in 2023 committing to making some changes going forward. 
Minbashian said since the Mission Project, she’s seen modest improvements on the ground. 
She’d still like more guardrails and transparency around the Forest Service’s reliance on logging plans that allow companies to decide in real-time which trees to cut, and clearer expectations for when large trees will be removed.
“Consistently, the way that the project is described in public documents and then the way it’s implemented is really different,” she said.
The lack of details in the plans makes it hard to compare what unfolds on the ground. “All the Forest Service does is say, ‘Oh, we’ll do better next time,’” Bailey said. “There’s nothing you can hold them to legally, that says you have to do something different than what you’ve been doing.” 
Minbashian’s organization is now working with the Forest Service to do baseline monitoring for the upcoming Twisp restoration project, in hopes that large trees are kept on the landscape and history doesn’t repeat itself. She still wants projects to succeed. 
“There’s a lot more components to it than just the commercial timber sale,” she said. “There’s road decommissioning and stream restoration, and understory thinning and all that to improve the damage that was done in the past.”
Minbashian understands where Bailey’s mistrust comes from. She feels it, too. But she thinks the people working locally with the Forest Service have good intentions, and she’s choosing to focus on that.
“You can say, well, of course, they did that. They’re the Forest Service; they’re going to have bad intentions,” she said, referring to the Mission Project. “Or you can say, well, there could be a variety of factors why it didn’t get implemented in the way we envisioned. And let’s look at that and what happened, and can we fix that going forward?”
“That’s just the approach we’ve decided to take, and we will see how it goes,” Minbashian said before pausing. “I think the folks who don’t see it that way may just think that this is another timber grab, and maybe it could be going forward under this new administration. That’s a whole new variable.”

Thousands of K-12 students in Detroit consistently miss days of school.
Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing at least 10% of school days – or 18 in a 180-day academic year. In Detroit, chronic absenteeism rose during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a persistent challenge.
To encourage attendance, the Detroit Public Schools Community District is getting creative. This past year, Michigan’s largest school district awarded US$200 gift cards to nearly 5,000 high schoolers for attending all their classes during a two-week period, and Superintendent Nikolai Vitti also floated the idea of providing bikes to help students get to class. Some district students lack access to reliable transportation.
To understand the consequences of kids regularly missing school, The Conversation U.S. spoke with Sarah Lenhoff, associate professor of education at Wayne State University and director of the Detroit Partnership for Education Equity & Research, an education-focused research collaborative, and Jeremy Singer, an assistant professor of education at Wayne State University. Lenhoff and Singer wrote a book published in March about the socioeconomic drivers of chronic absenteeism in K-12 schools and how policymakers and communities, not just educators, can help.
Is chronic absenteeism the same as truancy?
No. Truancy is how schools have thought about and dealt with student attendance problems since the early days of public education in the United States in the 19th century and is still defined in state law across the country. It focuses on “unexcused” absences and compliance with mandatory school attendance laws. By contrast, chronic absenteeism includes any absence – whether “excused” or “unexcused” – because each absence can be consequential for student learning and development.
Chronic absenteeism is usually defined as missing 10% or more school days. The 10% threshold is somewhat arbitrary, since researchers know that the consequences of missing school accumulate with each day missed. But the specific definition of chronic absenteeism has been solidified in research and by policymakers. Most states now include a measure of chronic absenteeism in their education accountability systems.
How big of a problem is chronic absenteeism in Detroit’s K-12 public schools?
Detroit has among the highest chronic absenteeism rates in the country: more than 50% in recent school years. Prior to the pandemic, the average rate of chronic absenteeism nationwide was about 15%, and it was around 24% in 2024.
In one of our prior studies, we found Detroit’s chronic absenteeism rate was much higher than other major cities – even others with high absenteeism rates such as Milwaukee or Philadelphia.
This is related to the depth of social and economic inequalities that Detroit families face. Compared to other major cities, Detroit has higher rates of poverty, unemployment and crime. It has worse public health conditions. And even its winters are some of the coldest of major U.S. cities. All of these factors make it harder for kids to attend school.
Rates of chronic absenteeism spiked in Detroit during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they did statewide. The Detroit Public Schools Community District has come close to returning to its pre-pandemic levels of absenteeism. The rates were 66% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 62% in the school year right before the pandemic began, 2018-19.
Detroit’s charter schools have struggled more to bring down their chronic absenteeism rates post-pandemic, but the numbers are lower overall – 54% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 36% in 2018-19.
How does missing school affect students?
The connection between attendance and achievement is clear: Students who miss more school on average score worse on reading and math tests. As early as pre-K, being chronically absent is linked to lower levels of school readiness, both academically and behaviorally. By high school, students who miss more school tend to earn lower grades and GPAs and are less likely to graduate.
And it’s not just the absent students who are affected. When more kids in a class miss school regularly, that is associated with lower overall test scores and worse measures of skills such as executive functioning for other students in that class.
Does chronic absenteeism vary by family income or other factors?
Rates of chronic absenteeism are much higher among students from low-income families. In these cases, absenteeism is often driven by factors outside a student’s control such as unstable housing, unreliable transportation, health issues, lack of access to child care, or parents who work nontraditional hours. These challenges make it harder for students to get to school consistently, even when families are deeply committed to education.
School-based factors also influence attendance. Students are more likely to be chronically absent in schools with weaker relationships with families or a less positive school culture. However, even schools with strong practices may struggle if they serve communities facing deep socioeconomic hardship.
Ultimately, we don’t view chronic absenteeism as an issue of student motivation or family values. Rather, we see it as an issue related to the unequal conditions that shape students’ lives.
Does punishing absent kids or their parents work?
Many schools have suspended students for absences, or threatened their parents with fines or jail time. In some cases, families have lost social services due to their children’s chronic absenteeism.
Research shows these strategies are not only ineffective, they can make the problem worse.
For example, we found that when schools respond with punishment instead of support, they often alienate the very students and families who are already struggling to stay connected. Harsh responses can deepen mistrust between families and schools. When absences are treated as a personal failing caused by a lack of motivation or irresponsibility rather than symptoms of deeper challenges, students and parents may disengage further.
Instead, educators might ask: What’s getting in the way of consistent attendance, and how can we help? That shift from blame to understanding can help improve attendance.
What can policymakers, school districts and community organizations do to reduce chronic absenteeism?
Chronic absenteeism is a societal issue, not just a school problem. In other words, we need to recognize that chronic absenteeism is not a problem that schools can solve alone. While educators work to improve conditions within schools, policymakers and community leaders can take responsibility for the broader factors that influence attendance.
This could look like investing more resources and fostering collaboration across sectors such as health care, housing, transportation and social services to better support students and their families. Community organizations can play a role too, offering wraparound services such as mental health care, access to transportation, and after-school programming, all of which can support families. In the meantime, educators can focus on what they can control: strengthening communication with families, building supportive relationships and helping families connect with existing services that can remove attendance barriers.

(Frank van Manen/USGS)Here we go again.
The internet is abuzz with claims that animals are fleeing Yellowstone National Park and suggesting that the bears, elk and other creatures know something about Yellowstone’s volcanic system that humans don’t.
Hogwash.
The nonsense seems to have started on July 10, when a social media post suggested that “hundreds” of mountain lions were leaving Yellowstone National Park, heading south — never mind that there are only about 40 of those animals in the entire park. The video showed cougars walking on a snowy paved road, which is obviously not how Yellowstone looks in July.
A few days later, the rumors went into overdrive when the same account shared a video of bears walking past a few cars — the claim was, once again, that they were leaving Yellowstone. The animals were hugely fat and not behaving as they would in the wild, and the landscape and vegetation looked nothing like Yellowstone. Internet sleuths eventually traced the location of the video to a drive-through wildlife park in South Dakota.
Not that such inconsistencies mattered. Millions of people viewed the original post and the claims went viral, repeated and modified on numerous other platforms and made more and more fantastic and ominous. One post showed a herd of wildebeest crossing a river in Africa. It’s not clear if that post was trying to be sarcastic. Soon, even major media outlets were covering the “story,” and Yellowstone National Park staff members and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory Consortium scientists had to give interviews to counter the rumors.
The original post seems to have been a joke, but just like the children’s game of telephone, the more the story was retold, the more it was twisted.
The flames might have been fanned by this very Caldera Chronicles column, which on July 14, 2025, described the discovery of a new thermal feature in Norris Geyser Basin. That story, too, was picked up and reposted, but often with worrying overtones — for example, that scientists were supposedly “baffled” by the appearance of the new hot spring.
Maybe this is why all the bears were leaving Yellowstone? Except, of course, the spring at Norris Geyser Basin formed in December 2024, and several new features like that appear every year across the park — for example, the steaming vent near Nymph Lake between Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth Hot Springs that formed in August 2024.
The myth that animals are leaving Yellowstone is nothing new. This rumor comes up every year or two, and sometimes, as in 2025, it grows to ridiculous proportions.

In 2014, an employee of a Yellowstone nonprofit organization filmed several bison running along a road and posted it online — he thought it was a fun video and not at all abnormal, given that bison are always running around Yellowstone National Park. But the video took on a life of its own, and it was reposted by people claiming the bison were running away from the park, even though they were actually running toward the park’s interior.
More than two weeks after the 2014 video was filmed, a M4.8 earthquake occurred near Norris Geyser Basin — the strongest earthquake in the region since 1975. This caused a further surge in claims that animals were running away, with some suggesting that the video of bison running was filmed after the earthquake because a volcanic eruption was imminent.

The speculation became so widespread that Yellowstone National Park put out a “rumor control” video explaining that, in fact, animals were not stampeding away from the park.
Earlier in 2025 a social media site known for satirical content showed a doctored photo of dozens of bears sitting on a road, supposedly in Yellowstone, and saying that the animals were blocking the entrances. Some bears were even carrying crudely drawn signs. Most people got the joke, but misleading reposts of the story caused concern among some who thought the animals knew something we didn’t.
Because of its incredible natural history and environment, Yellowstone can inspire our imagination. Where else but America’s first national park could you take in a view shaped by massive volcanic eruptions and featuring some of the country’s most iconic wildlife?
Perhaps, then, it is not a surprise that fantastic stories sometimes accompany this fantastic landscape. But the next time you hear that animals are, once again, fleeing Yellowstone in droves, we would suggest a healthy dose of skepticism. At least until those bears with signs learn to write more legibly, anyway.

A recently signed New Hampshire law will require doctors to follow patients’ wishes with regard to voluntary sterilization. (Photo by Getty Images)New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.
It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.
Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.

 States without programs face rollout decisions without clear federal guidance, advocates say

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Administrative costs for Idaho’s private school tax credit rise to $675,000

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.


– Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution


The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
 What do these programs look like across the country?

FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Momentum is building for a special session of the Missouri Legislature to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts with the aim of gaining a seat for Republicans.
Democrats will fight it, but a united Republican majority with more than two-thirds of the seats in both chambers can force it through if they wish.
Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, speaking Friday on KSSZ-93.9 in Columbia, said it is “likely” that lawmakers will be called in. She was in Jefferson City for discussions about a special session, but she had seen no map proposals and was unsure on the timing.
She first heard that President Donald Trump was urging Republicans to redistrict the state from discussion of social media posts by Republican members of Congress, O’Laughlin said.
“Lots of things run downhill,” O’Laughlin said. “So I thought, ‘well, this will be ending up in our neighborhood here before long.’ And it has.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe would need to convene a special session. His office did not respond to an email inquiry asking for comment on Friday.
In a little more than a week, the idea of redrawing Missouri’s congressional district lines has gained enough momentum to seem inevitable, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said in an interview with The Independent.
Republican members are “gung-ho,” she said, while Democrats are looking for ways to derail it. The chances of that are slim, she added.
“I’m kind of just waiting, I suppose, but I fully expect it to happen,” Aune said. “Everyone I’ve talked to, especially on my side of the aisle, expects to go down and get steamrolled on the issue during a special session.”

Missouri has eight seats in the U.S. House, six held by Republicans and two held by Democrats — the same total and partisan division it has had since a seat was lost after the 2010 census. Of the eight members, only U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a St. Louis County Republican, has won with less than 60% support in the two elections since the maps were redrawn to reflect the 2020 census.
Wagner represents the 2nd District, which has portions of St. Louis, St. Charles and adjacent counties.
The target for Republicans is the 5th District, held since 2005 by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. He won his two most recent elections with 61% in 2022 and 60% last year. The two adjacent districts, the 4th and the 6th, are held by Republican U.S. Reps. Mark Alford and Sam Graves, who each received more than 70% of the vote for the past two elections.
A major hurdle for any special session on redistricting is that it will have a purely partisan intent, to gain an advantage for the Republican Party. This year saw a major break between Republicans and Democrats in the state Senate when partisan priorities were slammed through with a motion, rarely used in the upper chamber, to shut off debate.
The previous question, or PQ, was invoked to overturn the voter-passed initiative providing minimum standards for paid sick leave at most businesses and to send voters a constitutional amendment repealing the abortion rights measure approved in November.
It would almost certainly have to be used again to bring a redistricting bill to a vote because, otherwise, Democrats could use the rules that put no limit on how long a member can hold the floor to block it.
After the Senate adjourned at the regular session, Democrats vowed to punish Republicans by clogging up the chamber so little work can be accomplished as a way to prevent a repetition. State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, forced Republicans to bring 17 senators from their homes in late May for what was supposed to be a largely ceremonial day of final paperwork from the session.
A truce of sorts prevailed in the Senate during a special session in June that approved stadium financing for professional sports teams and aid to storm victims in St. Louis. 
A redistricting special session would 
 “The point is to discourage future PQs and get us back on track to functioning and working together,” Webber said. “The more times that the process is abused, probably the stronger the correction has to be, which would mean that, for a larger correction, you need more consequence, more intervention.”
Some Republicans aren’t enthusiastic about redistricting now. The only time Missouri lawmakers have revised maps between census-determined allocations was in the 1960s following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that districts must be nearly equal in population.
State Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, in 2022 was an enthusiastic supporter of drawing a map that made it likely Republicans would win seven of the state’s seats. He’s not sure he wants to vote for a bill to do that now.
“I started thinking about, what if the tables were turned and the Democrats had the majority?” Moon said. “If we’re honest with ourselves, I would say that we would not want the tables turned the other way. And you won’t get many people to say that publicly.”
The other danger, House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowling Green said, is that voters the GOP takes for granted may not be so firm.
“I don’t know that a 7-1 map ever existed,” Perkins said. “I think a 7-1 map is easily a 5-3 map in a year that doesn’t go the way that conservatives want it to go.”
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, said that is not something that worries him. Schroer, the leader of the Missouri Freedom Caucus, said he wants to change district lines on the eastern side of the state as well, to put all of St. Charles County into the 2nd District with portions of St. Louis County. 
But cutting off discussion won’t make next year worse, he said.
“It’s politics. You’re going to have fighting no matter what. You’re going to have some strange moments,” Schroer said. “But look, the use of the PQ is not a new thing. I mean, it comes and goes. It’s like a roller coaster.”
Texas lawmakers are in special session looking at redrawing districts in that state to give Republicans an additional five seats. Democratic governors in California, Illinois and New Jersey have suggested they would do the same in response.
 Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowing Green speaks during debate Feb. 11 on his bill exempting capital gains from the state income tax (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
If Missouri Democrats are upset about a new redistricting plan at home, they should also be saying Democratic states shouldn’t do it, either, Perkins said.
“To someone on the left, your fury and outrage needs to be directed equally to Illinois and California for doing the same thing,” Perkins said
Vice President J.D. Vance, in a social media post, attacked the way California is currently drawn.
“The gerrymander in California is outrageous. Of their 52 congressional districts, 9 of them are Republican. That means 17 percent of their delegation is Republican when Republicans regularly win 40 percent of the vote in that state,” Vance wrote. “How can this possibly be allowed?”
In the November election, no Democrat running statewide received less than 37.9% of the vote, and Democrats hold 25% of the U.S. House seats, which would fall to 12.5% if the 5th District became Republican.
Vance’s criticism of California could be applied to Missouri, Perkins said.
“Do I think that it’s ethical to be the same across the board, to have your opinion applied the same to all things?,” he said. “Yeah, I think it probably is right.”
With Republicans holding a slim majority in the U.S. House, Republicans at the state level have a responsibility to their voters to do what they can to shore it up, Schroer said.
“It’d be a disservice to them to not revisit this issue to see if we can make the manual cleaver spot a competitive seat,” Schroer said.
O’Laughlin, in the radio interview, said she understands the criticism from Democrats.
“The biggest concern that people have, first of all, is that the Senate doesn’t like to do something out of the ordinary like that, because it’s viewed as just not listening to the other side, not working with other people,” O’Laughlin said. “And I understand why they would feel that way.”
But with Democratic states preparing to redistrict, she said, Republicans need to rally to protect the Trump presidency and what they view as its achievements.
If Kehoe issues the call, Democrats intend to paint him as Trump’s puppet.
“I don’t think anybody that I’m aware of was talking about redrawing maps in the middle of the census until Trump started pushing it,” Webber said.
In a video shared on social media by the Missouri Democratic Party, Webber bluntly assessed the push for redistricting as a distraction from the biggest issue plaguing the president right now, the demands from his supporters to release files on child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
“This entire thing is to make sure there (are) not investigations into the Epstein files,” Webber said. “Because if you’re a pedophile that raped kids on Epstein island, the biggest winner of this would be those people.”
Aune, who said Moon’s comments give her a small hope Republicans will resist Trump’s demands, said Kehoe’s actions will show who he is.
“Who needs a governor,” Aune said, “and even who needs a Republican super-majority legislature, when we have daddy Trump in the White House pulling the strings?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012424_olaughlin1-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-08-02 06:56:32.988249

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)To me, our government has become more and more out of step with the general public every year. At both the federal and state levels, legislatures are passing laws that face big public opposition while ignoring policies that have supermajority public support. 
If our government is supposed to reflect the will of the people, it’s clearly failing.
Our plurality elections are a big reason for this failure. Even though it’s all we’ve really used in Kansas, plurality is not benign or neutral. I believe it actually harms most voters. It works to shut out those who are in the opposition. It also harms voters in safe districts by denying them a voice. Their representative has been chosen long before any votes have been cast. Plurality elections are also very easy to gerrymander, as we see in each redistricting cycle.
Is this the best way to choose our representatives? To minimize the number of votes that actually make a difference? I understand why some may support plurality if they believe it best advances their interests, but I like to think that most people agree that the current way of doing things is fundamentally unfair.
One’s opinion on a voting system is a moral choice as much as it can be a strategic one. This is why I advocate for proportional representation in our elections. Such a system allocates seats by vote share, so parties will still gain seats in districts where they are in the minority. This does a better job of electing bodies that reflect the priorities of the entire electorate, and not only the whims of one group. If the goal of our government is to give all voters an equal voice, then proportional representation will get us much closer to that ideal than plurality.
Of course, there are high barriers to passing election reform. The largest beneficiaries of plurality are our elected officials and their donors. Even if they don’t explicitly say it, they have a great motivation to keep things the way they are. I can understand why representatives in safe districts wouldn’t want more competition for their seats, but I also think that it says a lot about their character that they’d rather benefit from a broken system than use their power to fix it.
There are some politicians who support reform, but they are in the minority. In Kansas, former Republican state Sen. John Doll is one such supporter. In the 2023 session, he introduced Senate Bill 202. This bill would have allowed proportional representation in our state using ranked ballots, but it died without a hearing. His party colleagues then went on to ban ranked ballots this year so local governments couldn’t adopt that reform themselves.
With these barriers in mind, I went looking for historical examples of election reform to understand how they succeeded. In our original Kansas constitution, the state House was apportioned such that every county had a minimum of one seat. By the 1950s, a report by professor C. Stewart Boertman of Emporia State showed that this created a massive malapportionment between the rural and urban areas.
From the report: “For Greeley county one representative represents 1,966 persons; for Sedgwick one representative represents 85,620 persons. Thus, if Greeley county receives one member for about 2,000 persons, Sedgwick should have approximately 128 representatives.”
Today, our state House seats are apportioned into districts of roughly equal population. I wish I could share an uplifting story in which our representatives put aside their self-interest and came together to pass a constitutional amendment, but that’s not what happened. It was the U.S. Supreme Court’s “one person, one vote” rulings in the 1960s that first forced the state to reapportion the House by population.
That isn’t to say that there was no advocacy for reform, as there certainly was. Most notably, the Hutchinson News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1965 for its years-long campaign “to bring about more equitable reapportionment of the Kansas Legislature, despite powerful opposition in its own community”. When the Legislature finally got around to amending our constitution to align with the ruling, voters easily approved the measure.
Does this mean we’d need to wait for another favorable Supreme Court ruling for further election reform? Thankfully, no. Ordinary people still have the agency to make this change happen. Canadian political scientist Dennis Pilon found that significant election reform in western countries most often happens as a result of multi-party agreements. The motivations for this agreement could be different – some parties may want reform as it aligns with their principles, while others may see it as a hedge against a total loss of power.
If proportional representation becomes a reality, it would come from popular support for the issue. It would come by elevating politicians who support reform and drive their parties to adopt the policy as a plank in their platform. It would come from sustained advocacy from the media and grassroots organizations.
The moment for reform might come when those who currently work to maintain the status quo end up getting burned by plurality’s failings. As political scientist Lee Drutman suggests, if Elon Musk’s America Party spoils a handful of Congressional elections in 2026 then that could create more of an appetite for reform at the national level. Or perhaps the proposed mid-decade gerrymander by Republicans backfires and leads to them losing seats overall. Whatever the case, proportional representation must be part of the conversation when that moment comes.

Shown is the downtown Lincoln campus of Southeast Community College. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)The U.S. bioeconomy is driven by access to domestic feedstocks and our ability to successfully convert those feedstocks into the manufactured goods that we use every day. America’s heartland is a rich source of these feedstocks — including corn, soybeans, and sugar beets — that can be used by bioindustrial manufacturers to realize the promise of the bioeconomy.
Specifically, Nebraska has abundant natural resources and a strong, capable, resilient, workforce. Gov. Jim Pillen has said, “The biobased economy is gigantic for the future. It’s [Nebraska’s] Silicon Valley.”
While the U.S. tries to reach its full potential of this bioeconomy, many factors have fallen into place that could allow Nebraska to emerge as a leader, including political support, government and private sector funding and workforce development. Growing the bioeconomy is a state priority, and Lincoln-based Southeast Community College (SCC) is working to help meet the current and future demands of our state.
SCC serves a primarily rural 15-county area in southeast Nebraska, including the future home of Citroniq Chemicals’ decarbonized plastics production facility, the largest in the world. To ensure our workforce is adequately prepared, SCC in 2021 launched a new biotechnology program featuring three stackable credentials to prepare the next generation of skilled technicians to work in the industry.
Students acquire industry-relevant skills, along with the knowledge of how to work in a regulated environment. Twice a year, industry professionals provide input on the most relevant skills they hope new employees hold — to ensure that graduates fit industry needs. Furthermore, SCC’s programs ensure that agreements are in place and that courses remain transferable to 4-year institutions, so that education opportunities can extend beyond a 2-year degree for those who want them.
Another key priority has been to ensure that a full pipeline has been built from middle school through graduate school, resulting in key partnerships with educational institutions and industry partners.
One success has been the development of an industry-relevant citizen science research project that links dog genetics to attachment behavior. SCC’s industry partner Neogen runs an animal genomics facility, also located in Lincoln, and many graduates of this program have gone on to lead successful careers at the site.
Furthermore, middle and high school teachers have been trained in summer workshops onsite at Neogen. During the school year, teachers are supported with equipment, materials and in-person assistance as they incorporate the research project into their classes. Career awareness helps expose teachers and students to the breadth of careers available in the bioeconomy. From the network of over 40 teachers trained, many are interested in adding more biotechnology to their current courses, as well as dual credit biotechnology courses. SCC is working to expand our capabilities and this network of teachers.
Collaborating with industry partners in the development of relevant curriculum is also a feature of SCC’s work. In partnership with Bluestem Biosciences and their recently funded BioMADE project to scale up production of bioacrylates, SCC is creating a module of related bioindustrial manufacturing curriculum. This will include study materials, assignments, and assessments designed to expand resources for community college programs in bioindustrial manufacturing.
This initiative supports Bluestem’s commitment to leveraging existing bioethanol assets in the Midwest, which includes cultivating workforce talent. The curriculum will provide an engaging introduction to fermentation and purification of organic acids, life cycle assessment and environmental justice.
It will also be crafted to resonate with Gen Z and Gen Alpha students and to align with best practices in educational content creation. The approach fits with BioMADE’s efforts to equip the next generation of technicians, engineers, entrepreneurs and plant operators.
Lastly, SCC has partnered with trade organization Bio Nebraska in its Fermentation Collaborative that seeks to increase collaboration between industry and educational institutions to improve opportunities for seamless work between 2- and 4-year institutions and raise awareness of the usefulness of precision fermentation. These collaborations have led to more connections with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, allowing for more opportunities for SCC students to engage in summer research and improved transfer opportunities.
Collectively, this work demonstrates the important role of community colleges in ensuring industry needs are met in the short term while also facilitating long-term partnerships that lead to future gains for a trained workforce. There are opportunities to participate in STEM careers at all education levels. Together, this will bring bio-based solutions to global problems.
Misty Wehling is a biology instructor at Southeast Community College, where she also co-chairs the biotechnology program. She led a team at SCC focused on meeting the workforce needs of Nebraska’s bioscience industry.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers prepare to convene back at the Alaska State Capitol on Saturday for a special session, on the agenda for lawmakers is a vote on whether to override a veto by Gov. Mike Dunleavy of a portion of the state budget.
If the veto is overridden, the Legislature would provide more than $50.6 million for K-12 schools this year. 
The vote comes just weeks before the start of the school year, and many Alaska school officials say the funding is essential for education, from managing class sizes, to hiring or keeping teachers and staff, academic and enrichment programs, as well as maintaining stability for students.
Fairbanks North Star Borough School District Superintendent Luke Meinert called the impacts of “chronic underfunding” devastating for the district’s more than 12,000 students. “In the last five years, we’ve closed seven schools, reduced administrative staffing by 25% and eliminated more than 250 positions in our district,” he said. “These aren’t just numbers. These are real people who spend time with our students every day.”
For Fairbanks, the governor’s budget veto represented a $2.5 million shortfall in June, following months of grappling with a $16.5 million deficit, and cuts and closures of three schools this year. 
Meinert called for adequate funding for schools that keeps up with the costs of inflation.

“Instead, we’ve been forced to make painful cut after painful cut, classrooms are more crowded than ever. Support services are reduced, and many students have lost access to critical programs that once supported them,” he said. “These cuts are not a sign of inefficiencies, they’re symptoms of a system in crisis.” 
Meinert joined a group of superintendents, education advocates and students on the steps of the Capitol in Juneau on Friday to urge legislators to vote “yes” on the veto override on Saturday, and funding a $700 increase in per student funding for schools. 
Siena Farr, a rising senior at Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé, spoke about her experience last year when Juneau’s two high schools combining into just one, doubling class sizes and straining teachers. “In my first week of school, my AP US History class had 50 students,” she said, which would have violated fire safety limits. “This ultimately led to 10 students willingly devaluing their education and switching to a less challenging class. … Increased funding would mean more teachers to teach high demand classes and cover for other teachers who might need it.”

Ida Meyer, a recent high school graduate in Juneau, said the increasing cost burden on students ultimately leaves some out. “When students have to constantly fundraise and pay out of their own pockets to be able to participate and travel for sports and activities or even buy school supplies that were once paid for by school funding, the equity of education has been left behind, along with the students that are unable to participate and reap the benefits of school activities,” she said.
Dunleavy issued budget vetoes in June, axing $200 per student from the base student allocation, which is the core of the state’s funding formula. This reduced the annual increase to a $500 per student, which was less than a one-time boost last year. The governor cited declining state revenues, as well his position that his priorities for education policy changes should be enacted ahead of more state funding. 
On Friday, Dunleavy issued a statement calling the Legislature’s lack of attention on his policy changes “a shame.” He repeated his criticism of providing more funding without more progress on education outcomes. “Instead, the public discourse is all about money. They say if we only spent more of it, the scores would improve. That is the same excuse that has been made for decades. As soon as more money is approved, the special interest groups and unions get very quiet.”
After the governor’s veto, the amount of public-school funding through the base student allocation is 5.6% less than it was last year, a year-over-year funding cut, according to the Legislative Finance Division. That is due to the loss of the one-time funding.
The governor’s veto represented a $1.4 million loss in funding for Juneau schools and its more than 3,800 students, according to the district, roughly equal to the cost of employing 12 teachers. But district officials had budgeted for a $400 base student allocation increase, so were safeguarded against further cuts.
In an interview on Monday, Juneau School District Superintendent Frank Hauser said he supports the veto override, and noted that even a $700 per student increase does not cover Alaska schools’ costs of inflation. “What a lot of people don’t realize is, well, that’s one of the most significant increases to the base student allocation that public education has received since 2011. It’s still a cut from what was received as one-time funding the previous year,” he said. “Public education funding is not keeping up with inflationary pressures across the state.”
If funding is restored, Hauser said it will go toward classrooms. “It’s going to support, potentially, reducing the pupil-teacher ratio. It’s going to provide maybe those elective programs. Some school districts weren’t able to hire a music teacher or an art teacher, or some other language teacher. That is funding that will go directly to supporting students.”
Hauser added that hiring new teachers or previously laid-off teachers back this time of year is difficult. “The hiring season is December to February,” he said. “So you just don’t have the staff or the potential applicant pool.”
Kuspuk School District Superintendent Madeline Aguillard emphasized her district’s need for school building repairs and major maintenance, which has received national attention, as the Legislature and Dunleavy have approved minimal funding for maintenance.
“No school district should have to choose between replacing a 10-year-old curriculum or repairing fire sprinklers to keep schools safe. But that’s the impossible choice districts are facing every day because the state has failed to meet its constitutional obligation over the last 25 years,” she said. 
This year, the Legislature passed about $40 million for school maintenance and construction, about 5% of the nearly $800 million that districts say they need to operate safely. Dunleavy vetoed nearly $28 million. Aguillard says it forces rural districts to draw from base student allocation funding meant for classrooms. “When the governor’s budget is consistently zero for maintenance, and what little funding the Legislature secures gets vetoed, then crumbling schools become the norm, not the exception,” she said. “We’re now forced to pull from the BSA to make major repairs.”
It’s unclear whether the Legislature will take up a veto override vote on school maintenance funding on Saturday. 
The Anchorage School District is the state’s largest by population, serving more than 43,000 students. For the district, the governor’s veto represents $4.3 million. Earlier this year, the Anchorage district reduced its budget by $30 million in salaries, benefits and services, and cut 42 staff positions. 
In an interview on July 18, Superintendent Jharrett Bryantt said if the funding is restored, it would go toward a major priority for the district: lowering class sizes. 
“When I talk to families, they say that the best thing we can do for their kid is to lower their class sizes,” he said. “But the state has to remember, you can’t lower class size if your teachers don’t trust your state to fund their salaries. And salaries should only be funded from the base student allocation. You can’t fund that with a block grant. You can’t fund that with a promise, and you certainly can’t fund that with all of the negativity that we’ve been seeing from the state to date.”
Bryantt emphasized that the back and forth between the Legislature and Dunleavy on school funding, with vetoes and override votes over the last several months, has been challenging. “So I just want the legislators to understand how trust has been extremely eroded by state leaders,” Bryantt said. “And this is their moment to make it right. This is their moment to tell the governor, once again, that this is where our community stands on this issue.”
For the Valdez School District, Superintendent Jason Weber said the district was able to balance its budget this year, with some cuts and reserve funding, despite an unexpected $300,000 insurance premium increase. In an interview Friday, he said if the veto is overridden, he sees those funds going toward future costs. 
“Unfortunately, inflation will eat right back in, whether it’s employee salaries going up, which they are, you know, where we’re bound by negotiated agreements, as well as … rising cost of utilities and insurance,” he said.
“So even if we’re on fiscally this year, we will be off fiscally next year already, just because those costs escalations are beyond our control.”

Philip Chad Wilson was sentenced to a 99-year sentence after his conviction and argued that  under subsequent rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Alaska Court of Appeals, his sentence was illegal because it amounted to a de facto sentence of life without parole.
On Friday, the Alaska Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that rejected his argument, noting that Wilson could receive discretionary parole by the time he turns 50 years old.
Alaska’s parole board granted only about one-third of requests for discretionary parole last year, and Wilson had argued that the parole board’s approval rate is so low that it doesn’t amount to a meaningful opportunity for release.
In 2020 and 2021, the appeals court approved fewer than one in five requests for discretionary parole. Those rates were significantly lower than historical standards; during the administrations of former Govs. Sean Parnell and Bill Walker, the parole board approved more than half of all discretionary parole requests each year.
“We conclude that Wilson’s challenges to the Alaska Parole Board’s procedures are premature because he has not yet gone through a parole hearing. And we hold that 33 years of incarceration is not a de facto life sentence,” wrote Judge Timothy Terrell, an appointee of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, on behalf of the court. 
In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits courts from sentencing children to life in prison without the possibility of parole, except in homicide cases.
Two years ago, the state appeals court ruled that the Alaska Constitution imposes further limits on top of those provided by the U.S. Constitution.
In that case, which involved a 14-year-old girl who pleaded no contest to three murders, the appeals court found that any sentence “that (requires) a juvenile offender to serve 45 years or more in prison before any type of parole release qualifies as a de facto life sentence.”
In Wilson’s case, a superior court judge ruled that because Wilson could receive parole after 33 years, his appeal fails the appeals court’s test.
Writing Friday, the appeals court said that multiple state supreme courts and legislatures have allowed children to be sentenced to 33 years or more in prison before parole. Wilson’s sentence is not unusual in that regard, it wrote.
With regard to the parole board’s performance, the court wrote, “Wilson’s statistics showing that the Board has granted parole to a minority of applicants in recent years does not prevent the Board from granting parole to any given applicant.”
Writing an amendment to the ruling, Terrell added that if the parole board were to postpone a parole hearing for Wilson and for similar child offenders, it “would be legally problematic … because this may extend their sentence to a length that could make it a de facto sentence of life without parole. I assume that the Parole Board will give full consideration to the applications of such offenders when they first apply for discretionary parole.”

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Aug. 28, 1963
As galling as it has been to watch a Jacksonville sheriff’s deputy break a car window and punch a non-combative man in the face, the feeble justification from the sheriff and a determination from the state attorney that cops did nothing wrong is just as infuriating.
The Feb. 19 videotape of an encounter with William McNeil, Jr. and a posse of rogue officers from the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, and their brutal response, is a searing reminder of everything wrong with policing in America.
These officers appear to have forgotten that they are supposed to “protect and serve” the communities they police. Rather than being respectful in their dealings with members of the community, too many times, those in uniform operate as if the people work for them. Because of their mindset, they operate as an occupying force that has to subdue a hostile populace.
In a recent press conference held to react to a videotape that captured the police assault of McNeil, Sheriff T.K. Waters was defensive. He refused to condemn his officers’ egregious behavior and, in a move right out of the victim-blaming handbook, had the temerity to question why McNeil released the video five months after the incident and concluded that he intended to inflame the public.
Waters was probably embarrassed because his men look like neanderthals who escalated a situation for no reason other than to show who was in control. I’m glad that the confrontation did not end with McNeil shot, injured, maybe dying on the street, because a cop “feared for his life.” This happens much more frequently than we are willing to admit.
 Troubled relationship
The relationship between African Americans and law enforcement has always been fraught with suspicion and hostility. America has never come to terms with policing’s slave origins and racially troubling past, their earlier role in controlling the movements of enslaved African Americans and the current role of monitoring the movements and activities of Black people, the poor, and working class.
The American Bar Association discusses the deep ties between chattel slavery and American law enforcement.
“American policing has deep historical roots in the system of slavery, with early forms of law enforcement in the Southern states, known as slave patrols, established to control enslaved populations and maintain the institution of slavery. These patrols were authorized to enforce slave codes, apprehend escaped slaves, and suppress potential revolts, using methods of terror and violence.
Waters claims there’s more to the story than the cellphone video that went viral. The sheriff warned against “a rush to judgment,” but McNeil’s lawyers, famed civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump and Harry Daniels, said the video captures a clear and compelling case of police brutality.
“He didn’t do anything but suffered tremendously. He suffered very significant injuries, including memory loss and closed head injuries,” said Daniels. “We’re seeking justice and legal redress. We’re planning on filing a lawsuit and doing everything to achieve justice in this matter.
“The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is unhinged. We’re pursuing all actions to achieve accountability and responsibility for what these rogue cops did.”
Daniels told News4JAX that McNeil’s injuries included a chipped tooth and concussion, adding that he needed stitches.
“This is one of these days that we have echoed over and over that the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is out of control. This is not a one-off. This is a systematic continuum of assault on folk in Jacksonville,”
 ‘Things we need to look at’
The police report of the traffic stop said McNeil was ‘verbally combative’ and reached towards a knife that was in the vehicle. Waters said McNeil was charged with resisting an officer without violence, driving on a suspended license, and possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana.
When asked by a reporter about the first punch that a cop standing by the door threw, Waters said it wasn’t a sucker punch.
“I’m not excusing it administratively. There are things we need to look at. The context of this video should tell you everything you need to know. It is what it is,” Waters said during the press conference. The video “provides a lot of information to the public. You’re not allowed to resist a police officer when he’s doing his lawful duties. It’s necessary to get you under control and take you into custody.”
According to ABC News, “in the video, officers with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office say they pulled McNeil over because the vehicle’s headlights were not on. McNeil questioned the traffic stop because it wasn’t raining and it was still light outside.
“An officer, who cannot be seen in the video, is heard saying, ‘It doesn’t matter, you’re still required to have headlights on.’ An officer asks McNeil to step out of the car, and when McNeil asks for the officer’s supervisor, another officer punches the driver’s window until it shatters. The officer then punches McNeil in the head before unlocking the vehicle door, unbuckling his seatbelt and forcibly removing him from the driver’s seat.
“Once out of the vehicle, multiple officers then gather around McNeil. One officer is seen grabbing McNeil’s head and punching him in the chin before forcing him to the ground.
 Unenviable task
Daniels wrote in a news release on Sunday that this incident is “only the latest in a long line of excessive force incidents involving the JSO.”
“In September 2023, the department was the focus of a national outcry after a video of JSO officers violently beating 24-year-old Le’Keian Woods while he was unarmed went viral,” Daniels explained. “In 2019, JSO officers faced a federal lawsuit for killing 22-year-old Jamee Johnson after pulling him over for an alleged seat belt violation,” the attorney said.
It’s clear that if there were no video, Sheriff Waters would have leaned on the fact that an internal “investigation” cleared the officers involved.
Waters explained that he was “aware of a video circulating on social media showing a traffic stop represented to be from February 19, 2025. … We have launched an internal investigation into it and the circumstances surrounding this incident. We hold our officers to the highest standards and are committed to thoroughly determining exactly what occurred.”
Yeah, right.
Waters, police brass, and civic leaders have the unenviable task of rebuilding public trust. But we shouldn’t hold our breaths because we’ve seen this before. There is a critical need for oversight by the public and civil society to investigate and prosecute cases of racial profiling and widespread abuses of power including use of excessive force, brutalizing protesters, bystanders, and others exercising their constitutional right to free speech and dissent.
But that is not happening.
 Clear and present danger
Law enforcement in the 18,000 police departments and across history in America has proven to be a clear and present danger to African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and other non-white people. Given DeSantis’ his record, and past comments, Floridians shouldn’t be holding their breath for him to use the considerable power entrusted in him to attempt to level the playing field and hold law enforcement more accountable.
Asking law enforcement to police itself is like inviting wolves into the henhouse. It never ends well.
I interviewed retired Seattle Washington Police Chief Norm Stamper, a fierce critic of modern American policing, and he was clear about what’s needed.
Stamper argues that what the United States needs is to “reimagine a public safety system that has armed professionals working with citizens.”
“There is a way of imagining and constructing a system with a commitment to genuine partners — the community and elected officials,” he said. “We need to see it as a 50-50 partnership. Others who have a stake would help create a new system with [police] unions ceding and sharing power.”
That reform includes bringing an end to racial profiling, excessive force, police brutality, corruption, and other law enforcement problems.
The epidemic of police violence in this country is not an issue of “bad apples.” Modern policing is rotten at its core. This must change now. Real change will come when we make meaningful changes to how police are funded.
Stamper, author of two books on good policing, has been a persistent and vocal critic of existing police tactics and the way departments interact with Black communities. “The entire criminal justice system and policing is broken,” he said.
 ‘Tainted and toxic’
Stamper describes America’s police departments as “tainted and toxic,” institution, saying the way officers act is a function not just of the culture, but also the power they wield, which makes them feel as if they can do what they want with no consequences. It is that attitude — and the deadly consequences particularly for African Americans — that has so angered protesters.
“It’s an arrogance that afflicts too many officers,” he said. “It causes them to believe that they’re above the law. What we’re facing from institutions in Seattle, San Diego, the NYPD, is an undercurrent of racism and abusive practices that lead to excessive force, lethal force, and sexual predation.”
Stamper said resistance from police unions and rank-and-file officers has hampered the radical restructuring of public safety.
“The public safety mechanism must be reliable, effective, and aligned constitutionally. I think that we must have the capacity to fight violent crimes, but we have to hold individuals accountable,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1920px-Jacksonville_Florida_2382086928-1024x417.jpg,,,2025-08-02 00:56:12.959301

A small coastal community in Kivalina, Alaska sued several major oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil, in 2008. Local representatives argued that greenhouse gas emissions from these companies were contributing to the erosion of the coastline and causing irreversible damage to their village by heating the climate.
But the U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed the claim, citing a lack of evidence linking the corporate emissions with coastal erosion.
In France, 2024, climate campaigners filed a criminal complaint against the major shareholders and the board of directors of TotalEnergies. They alleged that fossil fuels extracted by the company produced emissions that caused floods and storms that damaged property and irreversibly depleted biodiversity.
Despite acknowledging damage related to climate change generally, the Parisian criminal court also dismissed the case. Again, it said there was insufficient evidence to link the activities of TotalEnergies and damage from extreme weather.
Between 2008 and 2024, significant advances were made in climate science that enable us to understand how specific activities affect the climate, and contribute to wildfires, extreme heat and flash floods. The science linking these disasters to fossil fuel giants remains insufficient in the eyes of courts, however.
That’s because climate attribution science generally fails to meet the necessary standard of legal evidence to assign liability. For example, a recent advisory opinion published by the International Court of Justice acknowledged that states have a responsibility to address climate change, and that it is possible to establish a link between a state’s wrongful acts or omissions and the damage resulting from climate change. Despite this, claimants still sometimes fail to prove such a link in court.
However, a new study has demonstrated a computer model that can reduce scientific uncertainty around linking emissions from a particular source to outcomes related to climate change. This end-to-end attribution model, as it is called, could strengthen legal claims against entities damaging the climate.
Tracing emissions to damages
The end-to-end attribution model uses a three-step process to assign liability for climate damage.
First, using historical emissions data from online databases such as Carbon Major, the model simulates two scenarios: one with all historical emissions (the real world), and the other where the emissions from a particular company are excluded. The difference in emissions between these two scenarios is then paired with the concomitant increase in the global temperature, which shows how much warming can be directly attributed to that company.
Using statistical methods, the model can then connect the relevant global temperature increase to changes in the intensity of heatwaves in a particular region. It could, for instance, calculate how much hotter the five hottest days of the year have become in a given year because of the company’s emissions.
The model estimates the economic impact of these intensified heatwaves. It can do this using data on the consequences of reduced productivity and crop losses for growth, for example. It calculates how much money a region lost because of the heatwaves linked to the company’s emissions and gives a dollar value for the damages.
By combining these three steps, the model traces the path from a company’s emissions to specific economic losses, theoretically making it possible to hold emitters financially accountable for climate damages.
In doing so, the study estimated that emissions from Chevron alone caused between US$791 billion (£589 billion) and US$3.6 trillion (£2.7 trillion) in heat-related economic losses globally between 1991 and 2020, and that without emissions from 111 large oil, gas and coal producers (collectively referred to as “carbon majors”) such as ExxonMobil, BP, Saudi Aramco and Gazprom, the global economy would be US$28 trillion richer.
The advantages for claimants
Climate court cases in which claimants seek to assign liability to oil and gas companies are on the rise worldwide.
About 230 lawsuits have been filed against fossil fuel giants and trade associations since 2015. More than two-thirds of these were filed between 2020 and 2024, and many are awaiting a final decision. For such cases, end-to-end attribution could be helpful.
End-to-end attribution can assist claimants in meeting the commonly used “but for” test, by demonstrating that, but for a specific company’s emissions, certain climate-related damages would not have occurred. The method can also meet other liability tests. One is called proportional liability, and it attempts to quantify the extent to which a company’s emissions contributed to increased risk or the severity of damage. This flexibility strengthens the method’s applicability across different legal systems.
The end-to-end attribution method enables claimants to connect global warming to local disasters, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest “heat dome”. This is crucial, as climate litigation focused on single, high-impact events is usually more successful.
It is well established that emissions from companies in the U.S. and Europe have caused significant harm which is disproportionately suffered in the global south. End-to-end attribution strengthens the evidence base for such climate justice arguments in courtrooms.
There are no established standards for how courts worldwide evaluate scientific evidence. Consequently, while the end-to-end attribution method can link fossil fuel companies and climate-related legal injuries, the courts, depending on differences between jurisdictions and the context of each case, may require higher thresholds to trigger criminal or civil liability.
Additionally, fossil fuel companies often argue that any harm caused by their activities should be weighed against the benefits their products also provide. However, the benefits of fossil fuels should not exempt companies from climate-related liability, because climate change is an existential threat.
End-to-end attribution provides a vital scientific tool for making fossil fuel companies accountable, and could reshape climate litigation globally.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court has expanded the scope of a Louisiana redistricting case that could weaken key provisions of the landmark Voting Rights Act. 
In a brief order released Friday afternoon, the court reframed the appeal in Callais v. Louisiana, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed against the state over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. The justices intend to look at whether a state violates the U.S. Constitution when it seeks to remedy a violation of the Voting Rights Act. 
In the order, the court asked parties to the case to answer “Whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.” 
The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
If the justices determine Louisiana violated the constitution with its latest congressional map, it could undermine the Voting Rights Act. The legislation was approved in 1965 to bolster the protections granted in the 14th and 15th Amendments. It has been amended five times since then to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates note federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law.

At question in the Callais case is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.  
John Bisognano, president of the National Redistricting Foundation, a voting rights organization, said courts have never ruled there is a conflict between the Constitution and Section 2. The Supreme Court upheld Section 2 in its 2022 decision in Allen v. Milligan, the Alabama case that required lawmakers there to add a second majority-Black congressional district. 
“To comply with that law, Louisiana must have a congressional map that includes two Black opportunity districts,” Bisognano said in a statement. “If the Court decides to now undo that precedent, it would be a head-spinning reversal of itself.”
Bringing the Voting Rights Act into question makes the case among the most important the court will rule on in its upcoming term. The decision could have nationwide implications, as it could set the standard for the degree to which race can be considered during the election map-drawing process that must occur after each decennial census. 
In June, the Supreme Court punted a ruling in the Callais case, indicating it needed to hear additional arguments before reaching its decision. The rare move came with little explanation and essentially meant a new congressional map, if ultimately necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election, when the 2030 census count would be underway. 
The court has given Louisiana until Aug. 27 to file a response to their question. White plaintiffs challenging the map will have until Sept. 17 to respond. 
Friday’s announcement complicated an already long and winding process in Louisiana that began with the 2020 census, which state lawmakers used in 2022 to redraw the state’s congressional districts. The original map, which did not add a Black district in Louisiana despite the state’s Black population increasing, was found to be unconstitutional, leading state lawmakers to redo the boundaries in 2024. 
The 2024 redistricting special session, called by Gov. Jeff Landry in his first days in office, brought together a set of strange bedfellows: Black Democrats, who wanted more minority representation; and white Republicans, who used the opportunity to unseat 6th District U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, who fell out of favor with fellow Republicans at home and in Washington, D.C. 
To unseat Graves, Republicans had to draw a map that complied with fewer traditional redistricting principles, creating district lines that run from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing down the center of the state and veering to pick up clusters of Black voters along the way. 
During oral arguments in March, Chief Justice John Roberts described Louisiana’s 6th District as a “snake” and raised concerns it might violate the compactness standard typically expected in voting districts. 
In spring 2024, an appellate panel of three federal judges — one appointed by former President Bill Clinton and two by President Donald Trump — found the new lines for the 6th Congressional District were illegal, though it was allowed to be used for the 2024 election. They ruled the boundaries had been drawn based on race, rejecting the state’s argument that politics drove its boundaries. 
Black voters and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund preferred the map with the more condensed, northeast Louisiana-based district. Some of those Black voters have intervened as plaintiffs in the Callais case.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The author of the new map, state Sen. Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, was explicit during the 2024 redistricting special session that protecting U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R–Start, who sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport, and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, was his objective. 
Notably left off his list was Graves, who had ruffled feathers at home and in D.C. because he was widely viewed as insufficiently supportive of Scalise’s failed bid for U.S. House speaker. Graves also endorsed Stephen Waguespack, one of Landry’s opponents in the 2023 governor’s race, potentially putting him crosswise with a powerful incoming governor whose interests drove the special session. 
The appellate court panel disagreed that GOP politics was the driving force behind the map’s lines. 
“Given the slim majority Republicans hold in the United States House of Representatives, even if such personal or intra-party animosity did or does exist, it is difficult to fathom that Louisiana Republicans would intentionally concede a seat to a Democratic candidate on those bases,” a footnote from the majority opinion reads. 
“The Court finds that … District 6 does not satisfy the ‘geographically compact’ and ‘reasonably configured’ Gingles requirement,” the opinion continues.
The Gingles test arose from a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that set standards for determining whether election districts meet federal standards.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Citing “credible allegations of fraud” and “exponential growth in spending,” the Department of Human Services asked the federal government for assistance in terminating a state  housing program, according to a letter signed by DHS Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi and released Friday.
The end of the Housing Stabilization Services program — which resides under the umbrella of the federal-state Medicaid program — comes after Gov. Tim Walz on Monday said his administration halted payments to 50 of the largest providers. Federal investigators say the program has become the source of a massive fraud scheme.
Gandhi’s letter to the federal Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services notes that “the DHS Office of Inspector General has suspended payment to 77 housing stabilization providers this year based on credible allegations of fraud.”
Earlier this month, the FBI raided five Minnesota businesses that have received millions in Medicaid money for services they didn’t provide, according to unsealed search warrants. The Housing Stabilization Services program is intended to help older adults and people with disabilities find and maintain housing.
Since its inception, the program’s growth has exploded. The Star Tribune reported recently that when the bill creating the program passed in 2017, analysts expected the cost to be  $2.6 million a year, but by 2024, the cost was $107 million. Meanwhile, DHS data showed more than 700 companies were paid for services in 2024.
Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson told KSTP recently that the “vast majority” of the Housing Stabilization Services program is fraudulent.
KARE 11 first reported on the program’s flaws last month, including widespread reports of payment for no actual services to people in need.
The failure of the program — in concert with the hundreds of millions lost via other programs — is sure to become political fodder, especially should Walz run for a third term.
Thompson said recently that when his current investigations are finished, fraud in programs administered by Minnesota could exceed $1 billion, stemming from a pandemic-era food aid program known as Feeding Our Future, the state’s autism program and rapidly increasing sums allegedly pilfered from other Medicaid programs.
Thompson says the problem is systemic.
“This fraud crisis didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s the result of widespread failure across nearly every level of leadership in Minnesota: Politicians who turned a blind eye. Agencies that failed to act. Prosecutors and law enforcement who didn’t push hard enough. Reporters who ignored the story. Community leaders who stayed silent,” he told the Star Tribune recently. “And a public that wanted to believe it couldn’t happen here.”
Walz will argue he took decisive action once evidence of fraud began to emerge in the housing stabilization program.
In the wake of the Feeding Our Future scandal, Walz and his administration faced years of criticism for being slow to act despite red flags about the program.
Even when the state Department Department of Education — which administered the food aid progam — sought to stop payment to some suspicious vendors, however, they sued the department and won in court.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3114-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 20:56:13.717626

The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska announced Friday that it had filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against federal and local immigration authorities on behalf of a single mother arrested during the June 10 Glenn Valley Foods raid.

Maria Reynosa Jacinto remains in a North Platte jail despite an Omaha-based immigration judge ruling on July 15 that she could be released on a $9,000 bond. 
The lawsuit challenges her prolonged detention.
 “There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.
 Stolen IDs alleged

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. They’ve said repeatedly that the focus from the raid should be on U.S. citizen “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by undocumented immigrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
The Guatemalan worker’s 19-year-old daughter Andrea Rafael Reynosa is a U.S. citizen. The ACLU says the mother had been working in the U.S. for 20 years, has no criminal convictions and was her family’s primary earner.

Prairielands Freedom Fund tried posting the bond money on Reynosa Jacinto’s behalf, but learned that ICE officials had issued an automatic stay of her release. That blocked her from getting released on bond while her legal team works on building the case for her to stay in the U.S.
ACLU Nebraska argues that the automatic stay unlawfully violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding the judge’s decision on bond, making the judge’s determination that there was no danger or flight risk “meaningless.”
 Trump administration policy change

ACLU officials linked the automatic stay to new “interim guidance” issued by the Trump administration July 8, which asserts that nearly all detained immigrants in removal proceedings are ineligible for release on bond. The new no-bond practice is the subject of a class action lawsuit filed earlier this week by ACLU’s national organization and other immigrant rights advocates.
ACLU officials believe the practice is a tactic to drag out detention to the point that unauthorized immigrants choose to leave the country, basically deporting themselves.

ICE has said the change in approach “closes a loophole to our nation’s security” that the Biden administration and others had based on what it describes as an “inaccurate interpretation” of federal law. 
The July 8 memo was key to an earlier and similar ICE attempt to keep a different Glenn Valley worker behind bars after a judge had granted him a $10,000 bond. That man ultimately was released on the bond, also provided by Prairielands, but only after the ACLU stepped in and an ICE official reportedly admitted having made an “oversight.” 
ACLU representatives said that ICE in that case, unlike in Reynosa Jacinto’s situation, failed to file the automatic stay paperwork.
Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director at ACLU Nebraska, said the automatic stay provision was used for decades previously “only in the rarest of cases.”

“It halts an immigration court judge’s bond order instantly without any reason particular to the person and without any opportunity for them to be heard on the issue,” she said. 
Houlden said that everyone has a right to due process under the law, including immigrants.
“The use of an automatic stay in situations like our client’s clearly violates that right,” she said.
Reynosa Jacinto’s lawsuit seeks a court order for her release on bond, or that immigration authorities demonstrate that her continued detention is lawful.
About 23 others detained in the June 10 Glenn Valley raid also remain in custody at the North Platte jail. More than 70 workers in all were apprehended. Some have been removed from the country and others are out on bond, ICE has said.
Mindy Rush Chipman, ACLU executive director, said the no-bond situation is more broadly impacting ICE detainees in Nebraska and across the nation.
“It’s affecting Nebraskans from all over the state no matter how they were intercepted and detained initially,” she said, adding that the ACLU likely will be filing more lawsuits. 
In a statement provided by the ACLU, the worker’s daughter said the period since her mom’s June 10 arrest is the longest they’ve been apart.
“It’s just us two and she’s always been there for me, working hard to provide a better life for us both,” said Rafael Reynosa. “It really makes me emotional that she’s still where she is and I’m here by myself even though she should have been out weeks ago.”
  “I was in shock when my mom was detained,” Andrea Rafael Reynosa, 19, says of Maria Reynosa Jacint0. (Courtesy of American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska)

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on July 31.
Lamoille County’s new affordable housing nonprofit has spent the last seven months settling into its new role as some towns look for assistance in addressing the ongoing housing crisis.
Downstreet Housing and Community Development, the Washington County-based nonprofit has taken over an array of affordable housing properties previously overseen by Lamoille Housing Partnership in Cambridge, Johnson, Morrisville and Stowe, even as the full merger of the organizations is not yet completed.
The merger should be finalized in September, according to Downstreet executive director Angie Harbin. In anticipation of the resolution, the organization has added three seats to its board.
Even as the nonprofit sets up in the county, the need for its services have grown.
“Just like the entire state, Lamoille County needs more affordable housing,” Harbin said. “There’s probably not a community in Vermont right now where that’s not true.”
A statewide housing assessment conducted by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency published earlier this year said that 13% of the county’s rental stock was built with public funding, and 6% of that rental housing is available with income-sensitive rental assistance. That same report identified a third of Lamoille County occupied households as cost-burdened, where residents use more than 30% of their annual household income on housing.
Though no specific projects have been announced, towns particularly eager to expand or replace their affordable housing, like Johnson and Stowe, have begun identifying Downstreet as a potential partner in that effort.
Part of the incentive for the merger, outside of the leadership vacuum at Lamoille Housing Partnership, was Downstreet’s size — roughly double the Partnership — and thus capacity to access more federal funding and expand faster.
In Stowe, where committees are exploring potential solutions to the lack of accessible housing, town officials identified Downstreet as a potential partner that could operate and administer housing through a a community trust fund, according to a recently published housing needs assessment.
In Johnson, DEW Construction has proposed a project like the one it oversees in Barre by coordinating with Downstreet on the grant-funded construction of housing on town-owned land. The nonprofit and builder could potentially build a mix of housing types, including single-family, owner-occupied and mixed-use rentals.
The town is hoping to potentially move quickly to take advantage of $67 million in community development funds recently announced by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, which are intended to assist communities hardest hit by the July 2023 flood. “A majority of funding will be focused on creating new housing units outside of flood plains and supporting infrastructure in the identified regions,” according to an agency press release.
“Not only are we operating existing affordable housing in Lamoille County but also making sure that we have the capacity to continue to develop there,” Harbin, the Downstreet executive director, said, noting that the group is currently exploring some properties in Johnson. “We are really committed to making sure that there’s at least one housing project that’s utilizing that (block grant) funding. We’re generally exploring real estate development opportunities in Lamoille County.”
Downstreet, like other affordable housing developers, is attempting to balance demand and funding. The Vermont Housing and Conservation Board is no longer replete with pandemic-era money, and there is now a great deal of uncertainty around federal funds amid the disruption of the Trump administration.
“We were seeing pretty significant cuts at the state level, because there has been so much Covid-era funding that was winding down, so we’re already looking at far fewer affordable housing projects developed across the state, and then there’s the federal funding,” Harbin said. “We don’t have a clear idea what’s going to happen or what’s going to be cut as at this point.”
Evictions avoided
The transfer of properties from the Lamoille Housing Partnership portfolio hasn’t been without its share of hiccups, particularly for a Jeffersonville property with a history of management issues.
Last October, just as Downstreet was about to take over management of the building, the Mann’s Meadow senior housing apartment complex was beset by a disabled elevator, stranding some of the less mobile residents on the upper floors of the building. At the time, Harbin requested patience as the nonprofit assessed each property and its maintenance needs.
Several residents at Mann’s Meadow recently received “notice to terminate tenancy” letters and warnings despite not owing any back rent. The notice was concerning enough to tenants that they reached out to the Cambridge Selectboard for help.
By the time selectboard members could inquire about the issue, according to a discussion at the board’s July 15 meeting, it had already been resolved. Downstreet had received incomplete information from the building’s former property management company, according to Harbin.
The former company abruptly ended its property management services at Mann’s Meadow, and transitioning to a new property management system quickly proved tricky.
“It’s a very alarming (notification) to receive, and we also weren’t aware that the previous property management company wasn’t using this type of notification, because it is typical all over the state,” Harbin said. “All of that has been straightened out, which is great, and we’ve been leasing up units right now, some at a bit of a clip, as we’ve been turning them over, getting them ready to lease up and then moving new folks in.”

Activists argue that immigration officials are using new tactics by moving detainees beyond traditional public access routes into the airport.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have begun quietly moving detainees through a nonpublic side entrance at the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, according to activists. The new tactic, activists say, bypasses public scrutiny and calls into question previous statements airport officials have made regarding their involvement in transfers.
Activists, who have been monitoring the airport for months and argue that ICE is carrying out illegal transfers of immigrant detainees, told VTDigger they observed ICE officials escorting a group of people through a side door early Thursday morning.  
A video taken by activists and shared with VTDigger shows a white 15-passenger van parked around 3:30 a.m. Thursday at a side entrance of the airport that appeared to lead to the security screening area. An unidentified man in a gray shirt at the back of the van is seen holding out both his hands and telling two activists, “Y’all need to stay right there.”
Unidentified people can also be seen walking through a heavy metal doorway.

Julie Macuga, a Burlington resident and activist who has helped surveil the airport, and Leif Taranta, a second activist, attempted to get information from the people moving inside the airport before they disappeared into the building, along with the man in the gray shirt. 
The video then shows the activists walking inside the airport to find that a metal gate closed off the Transportation Security Administration security screening area.
The activists said ICE’s 3:30 a.m. arrival was earlier than usual and before TSA opened for the day. It’s the second time in less than a week they’ve witnessed ICE officials move detainees through a side entrance, according to videos and emails the activists shared with VTDigger. 
Airport security later told the activists that they were aware of the activity, and that the people they had seen go through the door included ICE agents, one video showed.

Activists confront ICE agents using side door at Burlington airport in Vermont
An additional video reviewed by VTDigger, taken on July 25, shows unidentified men in masks moving people from a white van parked behind a BTV airport truck through a different side door and directly into the airport’s TSA security checkpoint line.
In response to criticism about the large number of detainees passing through the Burlington airport, airport officials have suggested in previous meetings and interviews that they don’t know when ICE transfers happen and that they have little interaction with the agency.
“We don’t get advised. We don’t get any communication,” said Nic Longo, the airport’s director of aviation, at a recent airport commission meeting. 
In an email response to VTDigger’s questions, David Carman, deputy director of aviation at the airport, said the use of the side door does not represent a change in airport policies. 
“Airport staff do not get involved with assisting with ICE/DHS detainee movements, nor does the airport have any communication with ICE on when or how the movements are taking place,” Carman said in the email. 
For years, federal law enforcement agencies “have had access to the secure areas of the airport for the purpose of law enforcement and supporting other federal law enforcement agencies,” he said. 
“Any actions pertaining to ICE detainee movements and how they bring detainees to the post-TSA checkpoint public spaces of the airport (where passengers board aircraft) are federal law enforcement and DHS decisions, and completely outside the purview of the airport,” he added. 
But activists say the apparent use of a nonpublic side door represents a change in the way ICE agents are using the airport. 
When pressed by activists at a recent airport commission meeting, Longo said airport staff have pushed back against ICE when agents parked in areas where parking wasn’t allowed — nearly towing the vehicles in some cases. At the time, Longo said the airport’s goal was to treat the agents like other law enforcement officials or members of the public. 
Almost two weeks later, Longo said it’s extremely rare for airport staff to interact with ICE, but because the airport receives federal grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration, it was obligated to cooperate with the federal government.
Longo told VTDigger that airport officials allow ICE to transport detainees through the airport because it’s a public use facility, and he can’t pick or choose federal agencies or members of the public who can use the facility. 

A police officer in Burlington tells activists he won’t ask ICE officials questions
“Our obligation is to cooperate and not impede U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” Longo told VTDigger on July 15. 
When asked about federal agents using the side door at the Burlington airport, James Covington, a spokesperson for ICE’s Boston field office, told VTDigger that “ICE Boston does not wish to comment on security protocols.”
‘They’re in the custody of government agents’
One of the videos taken Thursday shows advocates going to the closed airport police office, which the Burlington Police Department operates, according to Carman. They called the airport police number and told the responder they had witnessed people being in through a side door. 
“I’m aware of what you’re referring to and those people have been identified as ICE agents,” the police officer responded. 
Taranta asked if police had reviewed legal documents. 
“I know that as police you’re allowed to ask them for documentation that the transport itself is legal,” Taranta said.
“Yeah I have no reason to ask them for that,” the officer said.
“So the fact that there have been past illegal transfers doesn’t make you as an airport security make you think you should ask that this one is legal?” Taranta asked. 
“Nope, I’m not doing that,” the officer said. “I’m aware of what’s going on here. I’m confident that they are who they say they are.” 
“Are you sure the detainees are legally being taken from this country?” Macuga asked. 
“They’re in the custody of government agents,” the officer said. 
Macuga told him that wasn’t an answer. 
“Well it is,” the officer said. “I’m not going to debate this any further with you. I’ve got other stuff going on.”
The Burlington Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

‘I have to do my job right now’
ICE detentions and deportations have skyrocketed under the second Trump administration, with more than 36,700 people booked into ICE detention in June, and more than 56,800 held in ICE custody as of July 13, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization housed at New York’s Syracuse University. 
A study by the loose group of activists, which includes Macuga and Taranta, showed roughly 450 people detained by federal law enforcement in immigration cases have been transferred through Vermont’s largest airport since January.
The videos shared with VTDigger show the potential escalation by ICE officials in moving detainees beyond traditional public access routes into the airport to avoid detection as activists continue airport surveillance, according to Macuga.
The group of activists sent an email to the mayor’s office and Longo, Burlington airport aviation director, following the event. 
In the email, the group told officials that activists were in the public portion of the airport over the past week “as a stop gap measure while the airport and city improve their policies.” 
The mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
“We thought it was heading in a good direction,” Macuga said of prior conversations with city officials. “But then things really started to escalate in the past week to a point we haven’t seen the whole time we’ve been doing this work.”
Macuga said the activists’ work has led people across New England to reach out to them and that a network is forming of people who want to take on similar work at their own airports. 
They’ve also been training people to be bystander activists, including learning basic Spanish phrases. Over the last two weeks, someone in their advocacy network has stayed at the airport multiple days a week, Taranta said. 
“We want people to be safe, and to be told by TSA agents that investigating human trafficking in an airport is not their job is very chilling,” Taranta said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.)MADISON — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and other Democratic governors said responding “in kind” to Republican mid-decade redistricting is necessary at a Friday Democratic Governors Association press conference.
Kelly said she thinks courts would rule that redrawn maps from Republicans and Democrats are unconstitutional. If Republicans take this path, however, Democratic governors must also pursue mid-decade redistricting to “protect the American people,” she said.
“It’s incumbent upon Democratic governors, if they have the opportunity, to respond in-kind,” Kelly said. “Things are bad enough in Washington right now. What it would look like if there’s even a greater majority that this President controls — God help the United States of America.”
Kelly and other Democratic governors were in Madison for the DGA’s summer policy conference. 
Discussion over redistricting ahead of midterm elections started in Texas, where President Donald Trump’s political team pressured state leaders to redraw its map to gain more seats in the U.S. House and help Republicans maintain their congressional majority in 2026. Trump said a “very simple redrawing” of the state’s maps could help pick up five seats. 
Redistricting, the process of redrawing state legislative and congressional district boundaries, typically happens every ten years after the U.S. Census. 
Other Republican-led states, including Florida and Ohio, also said they would look at redrawing their maps mid-decade.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was not at the press conference, was the first Democrat to float the idea of gerrymandering the Democratic state to have fewer Republican seats in response. Democrats in New York and Maryland have also been looking for a path to gain additional seats in their states as well. 
None of the governors at the press conference said they would pursue that route but said they supported those that had a path to use it. Kelly joked that she “could” do mid-decade redistricting. “But what would I do? I’d just give them another Republican.” 
Evers said the blatant direction from Trump to pursue redistricting is a “constant threat to our democracy.” 
“I’m really pissed frankly, and we’re going to do whatever we can do to stop this,” Evers said, adding that Wisconsin would not be changing its maps. He said the state has already worked hard to “get fair maps.”
The Republican-led Legislature and Evers adopted new maps for the state Legislature in 2024 following a state Supreme Court ruling. Some have been calling for new Congressional maps, though those efforts have so far been rejected by the state Supreme Court. 
Wisconsin’s current congressional maps were drawn in 2022 by Evers and selected by the state Supreme Court with a conservative majority at the time. Democrats and their allies filed a new challenge to the maps in Dane County Circuit Court in July, arguing they are unconstitutional because they’re anti-competitive. Republicans currently represent six of Wisconsin’s eight congressional districts. 
“Because of those fair [state legislative] maps that we had, we were able to pass a relatively bipartisan budget, and it was a good budget, and so, in my heart of hearts, this is where we have to be, but… when you have a gun up against your head, you gotta do something,” Evers said.
  “I’m really pissed quite frankly, and we’re going to do whatever we can do to stop this,” Gov. Tony Evers said about mid-decade redistricting. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
“This move is unconstitutional. It’s again breaking the system. It’s, again, meant to game the system,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said. “Democrats are expected to have the decorum — we’re expected to protect the institutions, we’re expected to follow the rules on this.”
The times call for a different approach, however, he argued. 
“We’re not playing with a normal administration,” Walz said. “We’re playing with one that has thrown all the rules out of there… I think it is incumbent upon states that have the capacity or the ability to make sure that we are responding in kind.”
Governors criticize GOP over effects of the Republican megabill 
The Democratic governors also warned about the potential effects of Republicans’ federal reconciliation package. Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said government systems and programs being cut are not set up for states to operate on their own. 
“They were set up with the federal government as a very robust partner, and without them being a partner, there is no way that any of our states will be able to pick up the tail,” Kelly said. “The best we could do is perhaps mitigate the pain, but even that will be difficult.” 
The legislation, ” signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, made major changes to the federal Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Trump and Republicans in Congress are “trying to gut programs that Wisconsin families count on,” Evers said. “They’re willing to break our constitutional system to make that happen.” 
The megabill is just one tool, he suggested. “Whether it’s the Republican budget or the continued illegal action to fire Wisconsin workers, strip funds away from our state, damage public education, we have to fight.” 
A memo released this week by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau found that the exact effects of the federal reconciliation law on Medicaid and FoodShare in Wisconsin are uncertain, but will likely result in fewer enrollees.
Currently, about one in five Wisconsin residents rely on Medicaid for health care coverage. 
“The full impact of the Act’s Medicaid provisions on the state’s MA enrollment and costs remains uncertain,” the fiscal bureau memo states. “This is partly because some of the details of implementation requirements will depend upon forthcoming federal guidance, but also because the eligibility and enrollment requirements are new for the program and so little is known about their actual effects.” 
Starting in January 2027, childless adults will be required to complete 80 hours per month of paid work, school, employment training or community service per month to maintain their Medicaid eligibility. There are about 184,000 childless adults currently enrolled in Wisconsin. DHS estimates that 63,000 Wisconsinites will be at high risk of losing their coverage.
The LFB memo said that enrollment will likely drop due to the work requirement provisions. 
“Enrollment reductions could occur either because of the additional complexity of the application process or because the work requirements cause some individuals to increase their earnings to above the eligibility threshold. The magnitude of the program disenrollment, and associated reduction in [Medicaid] benefits costs, is uncertain,” the memo states. 
The governors warned that hospitals still face a difficult environment under the federal law. 
“Our rural hospitals in particular are extremely at risk,” Kelly of Kansas said. “We’ve already closed 10 of them in those 10 years and many more are on the brink, and this reconciliation bill is going to throw them over the edge.” 
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said 35 hospitals are at risk in his state, making it the state with the most hospitals at risk in the nation. 
“Donald Trump’s big ugly bill is the single worst, most devastating piece of legislation that I have seen in my lifetime. It is a direct attack on rural America,” Beshear said. 
Three hospitals in Wisconsin have been identified as at risk of closure. 
Costs for the SNAP program will increase in Wisconsin as the law reduces the federal share of the program — known as FoodShare in Wisconsin — from 50% to 25%. This will leave states responsible for 75% of the costs, a change that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services estimates will require an additional $51 million annually from the state. 
The FoodShare program currently helps nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites access food, and nearly 90,000 Wisconsinites will be at risk of losing their benefits due to the new federal provisions, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. 
Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee echoed concerns over the ability of the state  to pick up the gaps left by federal cuts in social programs.
“We’re not going to be able to absorb in funding what’s coming our way,” McKee said. “The taxpayers are going to pay for it in our states or the benefits are going to get reduced.” 
The law extends work requirements for SNAP recipients from the current top age of 54 to age 64. It narrows the work requirement exemption for caregivers and parents by changing the definition of “dependent child” from under 18 years of age to under 14, meaning that parents of 15- to 17-year-olds could now be required to have employment in return for their SNAP benefits. 
It provides an exception from work requirements for a married person responsible for a child under age 14 and residing with someone who complies with the work requirements. It also exempts individuals who are eligible for the Indian Health Services. 
“While Wisconsin just passed a Wisconsin budget that invests in our kids, cuts taxes for working families and supports our rural hospitals, Trump and Congressional Republicans are moving in just the opposite way,” Evers said. “Democratic governors aren’t going to just sit idly and watch it happen. When Trump tried to strip hospital funding, we moved real quickly to protect $1.5 billion dollars in health care funding for Wisconsin. When they threaten our schools, we stand up and fight back. When they attack programs that matter to working families, we find ways to fill the gaps.”
“Republican governors fall in line behind Trump’s agenda. Democratic governors are standing up for the people that we serve,” Evers said before mentioning 2026 elections. He said Wisconsinites will “make a choice about the future of our state when they elect our next governor. They’re going to choose a leader who will work together and expand health care, support working families and build an economy that works for everybody.”
Evers announced on July 24 that he would not be running for a third term in office, setting up the first open race for governor in Wisconsin since 2010.
“I know that [Evers’] leadership is not going to end just because the title might, and that he is going to be out there fighting for what he believes in moving into the future,” said Kentucky Gov Andy Beshear, who won’t be able to run for another term in 2027 due to term limits.
So far, Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez has announced her campaign, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley is planning on entering the race and other Democrats are still mulling a decision. There will likely be a crowded Democratic primary. Two Republicans have officially launched their campaigns for governor, while U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has been teasing a run.

Weather stations across Vermont have reported higher than average — though not quite record-breaking — temperatures.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  You’re not imagining it: This summer is hot.","From Burlington to Bennington, Vermont is having a rather hot summer, according to National Weather Service data. 
The average high temperatures for June and July this year were above the 30-year average for at least four longstanding weather stations across the state: Burlington, Montpelier, St. Johnsbury and Bennington. 
To get a read on how the whole summer measures up, we’ll have to wait. The National Weather Service defines the “meteorological summer” as June, July and August.
It’s also been drier than average in Burlington, Montpelier and St. Johnsbury, although Bennington had more typical rainfall for June and July. 
None of those locations quite broke the record for average monthly temperature so far this year. But weather service meteorologist Matthew Clay said multiple one-day records were hit — like in Burlington on June 23, when the daily high hit a whopping 99 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Those instances are becoming more common. 
“If I could go and look at every record statement that we sent out for a year, the vast majority of those are going to be record highs compared to record lows,” he said. 
The Burlington weather station has records going back more than a century. They show that the city has experienced a gradual rise in the number of very hot days over the past 20 to 30 years. 
The weather service has also issued six heat advisories so far this summer, a reflection of the health and public safety dangers of extreme heat. But Clay said it was difficult to compare that with previous years because the weather service lowered its threshold for issuing advisories from 100 degrees to 95 degrees in 2018. 
Also, the weather service’s threshold for heat advisories is lower in Vermont than in hotter places in the country, in part because Vermonters may be less able to handle the heat when it arrives.
“If it’s your first 90-degree day right after 50-degree weather, your body’s not acclimated,” he said. 
There’s also fewer homes with air conditioning in this part of the country compared to, for example, Arizona, Clay noted. 
“We don’t have centralized air in a lot of places in New England, so we don’t have the ability to cool off like they do in the South, where the air conditioning is more prevalent,” he said. 
Emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses spiked the week of June 22, when temperatures rose in Burlington and elsewhere, according to the Vermont Department of Health. 
Heat-related illnesses have fluctuated year to year, but “rates have been trending upwards since 2003,” according to the health department website. The department also has recommendations on how to keep cool and prevent heat-related injuries on its website.  
The weather is expected to stay cooler — in the 70s and low 80s — over the weekend, but parts of the state could see temperatures rise to the mid-80s next week, according to weather service predictions. 
Clay said that heat does tend to come in “waves.” 
“Sometimes you have these warmer spells, you have cooler spells,” he said. “You can’t just say that it’s all related to one thing or another, but we are seeing that, overall, our temperatures are warming.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Board of Corrections shut down its live stream of its Friday meeting after a hacker twice began playing a racist video containing racial slurs and the Confederate flag, along with swastikas and sexual imagery.
Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness was irate over the hacks, standing from his seat and demanding staff cut off the individual playing the video. The online meeting room on Zoom was shut down, but later reopened — only for it to be interrupted again. The meeting room was then taken offline for the rest of the day-long meeting.
In a statement sent by Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion, the board acknowledged the hack, calling it “unfortunate.”
“The Board wishes to convey an apology for those who were on the stream and were subjected to the content of the hack,” the emailed statement said. “It is a known issue affecting Zoom, and the Board will pursue other more secure options for future meetings.”
The hack was the loudest part of an otherwise hard-to-hear meeting, which was held at the Central Arkansas Community Corrections Center in Little Rock.
Another moment of contention came later in the meeting, when Department of Corrections Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown informed board members he had received invoices from an architecture firm for work on three projects he was not sure had been approved by the board.
“On the three projects, the cart was put before the horse,” Brown explained to the Advocate after the meeting. “We’re going to hold those over until the next board meeting” to look into “what went wrong.”
The projects are for roof repairs at the Wrightsville Unit, door controls at the Grimes and McPherson Units and fencing at the Pine Bluff Complex. The board opted not to vote on the invoices while DOC performs its review.
Board member Lona McCastlain expressed frustration about the unexpected invoices, noting that if the projects hadn’t been approved, then the firm shouldn’t have done the work it was invoicing for.
“I just really think this is a mess,” McCastlain said.
According to the invoices from Lockeby and Associates, the firm says DOC owes $13,125 for design work on the roof project, $40,500 for design work on the door control project and $16,406.25 for the fencing project.

Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez was dressed in his uniform and heading into the town office on Main Street on Tuesday morning, when he said he was accosted by a resident who “ranted and raved” at him using racist terms.
The man, whom Gomez later identified as Northfield resident Gary Allen Smith, proceeded to call him “boy,” “scumbag chief,” told him to “do your fucking job” and to “go back to Pennsylvania,” according to an audio recording of the encounter Gomez shared with VTDigger.
“He was cursing. He was getting in my face, pointing and referencing me as ‘boy’ several times,” said Gomez, a Black Latino man. 
He said he had never met the man before and did not provoke him.

Gomez said he encountered Smith in the vestibule of the office building, as Smith held the door open for him. Gomez said he thanked him but told him he was not exiting. 
That’s when the man yelled, “Get out of here,” he said.
Smith could not be contacted to comment for this story. Calls to phone numbers associated with someone with his name and age were not answered.
Scott Kerner, owner of the nearby Good Measure Pub and Brewery, said he was on his way to the bank next door when he witnessed the incident.
“I heard somebody yelling, and I looked up, and there was a guy with a tie-dye shirt yelling and pointing very close to Chief Gomez’s face in front of the town office,” he said. “It felt very threatening.”

Kerner said he walked up toward them because he was worried about the man’s tone and how aggressive he sounded. 
“I like Chief, and it just seemed like this guy was really out of hand,” Kerner said.
He said he heard the man call the chief “boy” and say “do your fucking job.” 
“The guy continued to yell at Chief, walked across Main Street yelling, then walked back and got back in his face and yelled at him again, all while I was standing right there,” Kerner said.
Through it all, he said, Gomez remained calm.
Trained in his past law enforcement work on how to react “as far as race-baiting is concerned,” Gomez said he was able to not react in a negative way. Although, as a person of color, he said he found the multiple “boy” comments racially charged.
Smith, who is 54 and was recorded as recently living in Northfield Falls, according to court documents, was convicted for assaulting a Northfield police officer in 2023.
Gomez said he reported the latest incident to Northfield Town Manager Jeff Schulz and others. Schulz said he is aware of the encounter and has the recording of the confrontation that occurred in front of the municipal building.
“The incident is very unfortunate and very disrespectful to the Chief,” he wrote in an email Wednesday. “Please note that as the Town Manager and a representative of the Town of Northfield, I strongly condemn all forms of racism and harassment.”
Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, said Gomez has faced the everyday pressures that come with the job and has carried the weight of systemic racism since the day he arrived in Northfield. She said town leaders must publicly declare their support for the chief.
“Chief Gomez was verbally attacked in broad daylight,” Schultz wrote in an email. “He was repeatedly called ‘boy,’ a word with a long and violent history that has been used to strip Black and Brown men of their humanity and authority. This is not just a personnel matter. This is a moral failure.”
Merry Shernock, the co-chair of the Northfield Selectboard, has been the most vocal of the five board members — at the last meeting and via email — in her condemnation of the continued racism and harassment Gomez has faced.
“I have nothing except respect and admiration for Chief Gomez,” she wrote in an email this week, adding that the sentiment is shared by the majority of residents. She prefers not to pay attention to those who express hate, she wrote, “but I am aware, much to my dismay, that they are among us.”
The board has initiated an investigation related to Gomez that remains ongoing, she said. Schulz and Gomez said they are unable to discuss details of the investigation itself as it involves personnel issues, which fall under protected information.
Shernock said she has been charged with organizing the racial bias training that was started at the April 28 meeting by a member of the state Office of Racial Equity. She expects that training will resume in October. A Northfield resident has also requested community racial bias training, and she said she is hopeful she can look into it this fall.
While Schulz wrote he condemns racism and found the harassment Gomez faced this week “unfortunate,” the town manager has not responded to multiple rounds of emails from VTDigger asking if he explicitly supports the police chief and his work. 
A pattern of harassment
Originally from Pittsburgh and in law enforcement for about 20 years, Gomez, 58, was a Philadelphia police officer and, later, a detective in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office.
He was hired in September 2023 as chief of police in Northfield, a Washington County town of about 6,000 and home to Norwich University. Gomez told VTDigger he has faced multiple instances of harassment and discrimination in the overwhelmingly white town since he took the job in wake of former chief of police John Helfant retiring amid controversy in May 2023.
Vermont has had only three police chiefs of color — in Northfield, Montpelier and Brattleboro. Brian Peete became the capital’s first Black police chief in 2020 but left for a job in Kansas after two years. Norma Hardy has led the Brattleboro police department since 2021 and is the first Black woman police chief in Vermont.
Earlier this year, at an April 8 selectboard meeting — a YouTube recording of which now has 1,600 views —  Lynn Doney, a disgraced former selectboard member, took issue with Gomez wearing a gray hoodie on duty instead of his uniform: “so he looks like a police chief and not a gangster off the street that’s just driving our cruisers around,” Doney said.
On April 23, more than 60 residents packed the room at the following selectboard meeting, the majority in support of Gomez. Many of them denounced Doney’s racist remark at the earlier meeting and wore hoodies themselves in a show of solidarity.
Gomez said he sent a letter to Doney asking him to cease and desist from such personal attacks. “It is unlawful for an individual to make deliberate statements that intend to harm the reputation of another party without factual evidence or simply based upon hearsay,” the letter he shared read.
Doney did not respond to VTDigger’s requests for comment then or this week but responded to Gomez’s letter in April. The letter signed by Doney, shared by Gomez, reads, “I will not apology to you or anyone else as everything I have said is true.”
Since that incident, residents and racial justice leaders have pointed out that racism and retention issues are problems many predominantly white towns face when they hire people of color and urged Northfield officials to be better about calling out racism and in vocalizing support for the chief. 
“He’s an excellent leader for our town and I am well aware … of what he’s had to deal with here. So, you know, we support him,” Kerner said Thursday.

Starting Aug. 1, New York will offer free phone calls in state prisons, becoming the sixth state to do so — and the first to enact the policy without legislation. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York will offer free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons starting Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so. 
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.
Cash assistance may curb recidivism among people leaving prison, study says

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

Josh Shapiro visited Philadelphia’s Community Education Center on Aug. 1, 2025 to discuss funding for the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD)’s Violence Intervention and Prevention (VIP) program. (Commonwealth Media Services)As the calendar turned to August, the state budget in Pennsylvania is one month overdue. Gov. Josh Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly have said they are continuing to make progress, but have not reached an agreement.
“We all understand the issues that need to be resolved in order to reach a final agreement,” Shapiro said to reporters in Philadelphia on Friday. “I think we’re working together respectfully to get that done.”
Shapiro said both sides know what the key issues are and it’s frustrating that they have yet to come to an agreement.
“But I also acknowledge that we’re working at a time where we not only have a divided legislature, we’ve got a lot of division in our society, and finding that common ground — that’s critically important,” Shapiro said. “It’s taken longer than I would like, but I think we’re going to get there and we understand the important issues that need to be resolved.”
On July 14, the Democratic-controlled state House advanced a $50.6 billion proposal to the GOP-led state Senate. Since then, House Democrats have maintained that it is up to the Senate for the next step in the process.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) wrote on social media on Wednesday, “We have different visions for the future of the Commonwealth, but we’re working together across the aisle to move this budget forward. Regardless of divided government or political philosophy, some of these issues are just extraordinarily complex & need to be done correctly.”
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told Newstalk 103.7 FM on Friday that “it is moving very slowly,” but said the reason why leaders are saying it’s been positive is because “nothing has blown up to a point (that) sides aren’t talking yet.”
“The reason why this is so difficult is because the issues we’re talking about are so transformational in terms of our future, and the two sides simply see it so differently,” he added.
Topper said they want to work towards a compromise, but warned “if we don’t get some of the policy initiative changes in terms of parental empowerment and school choice reform, in terms of entitlement reform and benefit integrity, economic growth and changing our regulatory policy in Pennsylvania, then in three years, we’re going to be looking at either massive … cuts that will significantly affect a lot of people in their everyday lives, or a massive tax increase, which nobody’s going to want to see.”
One of the issues that has taken center stage during negotiations is funding for mass transit agencies, as service cuts and fare hikes loom the longer the impasse continues. In June, the House passed a transportation funding package that would provide nearly $300 million of new funding into mass transit and a half-billion dollars to repair roads and bridges.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) said during an update on budget negotiations Friday that mass transit funding is “high” on the list of priorities.

“Our Senate Democratic Caucus stands ready with 23 votes to support Gov. Shapiro’s proposal with respect to mass transit funding for the whole commonwealth,” Costa said. 
Costa also highlighted funding for roads and bridges, education, and protecting social and human service programs as important.
At least two Republicans in the Senate would need to support funding for mass transit, even if every Democrat voted for the package.
On Thursday evening, Pittman said, “Our state is faced with a structural deficit just like SEPTA. Along with the discussion of any additional dollars for mass transit, this reality necessitates meaningful reforms and accountability measures must be implemented to ensure the long-term success of mass transit.”
Shapiro told reporters on Friday he understands “how critically important” mass transit funding is for the state, noting that he proposed it twice in his budget and that he previously flexed federal highway funds in November to stave off immediate fare hikes and increases for SEPTA.
“We’re going to keep working at that issue,” Shapiro said.
Last week, three Republican Senators introduced a package of bills that would provide additional oversight and new accountability measures over SEPTA. However, the package did not include funding.
When asked if he supported the proposals, Shapiro said he wants to “make sure that we fund mass transit, and we will have a broader dialogue of other legislation that may or may not accompany that.”
“I’m not going to get into that here in this setting,” Shapiro said.
SEPTA has been placing signs at bus stops throughout the Philadelphia area warning riders that if funding does not come to the agency, service cuts will begin on Aug. 24. 
“If that person lives in Northeast Philadelphia, call Senator (Joe) Picozzi, who’s a Republican in the state Senate, and tell him to go back to Harrisburg and vote to pass transit funding the way the House Democrats did,” Shapiro said.
Picozzi, who is one of the GOP authors of the SEPTA accountability package, has said he supports funding mass transit. Following Shapiro’s comments, the Republican lawmaker told NBC Philadelphia that “the people of the Great Northeast want to see a better SEPTA. We want funding and accountability for results on fare evasion, safety and cleanliness.”
On Tuesday, Spotlight PA reported Pennsylvania Secretary of the Budget Uri Monson warned that the state wouldn’t be able to make at least $2.5 billion in payments to schools, counties, and others amid the ongoing budget impasse.

Topper criticized that move, claiming that he thought it was “premature for the governor to send that message out,” arguing the state treasurer “can release funds to those, if needed.”
“But at the end of the day, it’s my responsibility and others to ensure that this budget is sustainable and that we’re doing everything we can to get a quality product,” Topper said. “And if the governor wants to try and use some of these tactics to push for any kind of an agenda of his, then I’d like to know…what that agenda is, other than being on TikTok.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) also seemed to ramp up the criticism of Shapiro on Friday, telling the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that those letters are an effort to “just trying to get people all riled up.” She added “this is the biggest gaslighting administration I have ever worked with.”
Costa, the Democratic leader in the Senate, seemed to echo Shapiro’s sentiment saying that “we are moving slowly, slower than I would like of course, but I think at the end of the day, we’re making progress, and I think that’s what’s important for the people of Pennsylvania.”
Shapiro said there is one thing both sides can agree on.
“We all have to compromise, and that’s what we’re doing right now,” he said.

Cindy Holscher, a candidate for governor, is critical of Kelly administration's pressure campaign to deter certain Democrats from running for the job.","Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat seeking the party's nomination for governor in 2026, said staff in the administration of Gov. Laura Kelly attempted to pressure Democratic lawmakers into idling their campaigns for governor so a preferred candidate could prevail. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State Sen. Cindy Holscher expressed frustration Friday with behind-the-scene involvement of Gov. Laura Kelly’s staff in attempting to influence who launched a campaign for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Holscher, who announced her bid for governor in June, said she was among three Democrats in the Kansas Senate told by the Kelly administration to stand aside so Democratic primary voters would be more likely to nominate Lawrence attorney Chris Mann in the race to determine who would be the party’s choice to replace the term-limited Kelly.
Holscher said she as well as Sens. Dinah Sykes and Ethan Corson, also of Johnson County, were initially discouraged from impeding Mann’s path in the August 2026 primary for governor.
“All three of us were told basically ‘do not run’ because Chris Mann’s the guy,” Holscher said. “Why are insiders picking candidates? We’re being bullied, essentially.”
After the dust cleared at the end of July, Mann had chosen to launch another campaign for attorney general after narrowly losing to Republican Kris Kobach in 2022. Corson and Holscher had declared their campaigns for governor. Kelly threw her support to Corson. Lt. Gov. David Toland, at one point the presumed frontrunner in a Democratic gubernatorial race, said he wouldn’t run. Sykes remained on the sideline.
Will Lawrence, Kelly’s chief of staff, said the two-term governor met with potential Democratic candidates for governor and offered advice on how each could approach the 2026 election cycle.
“No one told them, ‘You can’t run.’ They can make their own decisions,” Lawrence said. “There’s a lot of give and take in those conversations. It was never forceful. Cindy was the one that kept coming to the governor trying to get her support. The governor kept saying, ‘I’m not going to support you in the governor’s race if that’s what you choose to do.’ The governor was very clear about that.”
Lawrence said Kelly would prefer Democrats didn’t set the stage for grueling primary battles in statewide races.
 
‘Gone backward’
In an interview, Holscher said it was disappointing Lawrence had participated in an effort to essentially anoint a Democratic nominee for governor.
Holscher also asserted Lawrence attempted to leverage future political support from the governor to secure Holscher’s vote for a bill altering regulation of child care facilities and exemptions to vaccination mandates. Holscher said it was concerning that Lawrence wielded financial influence over Democratic campaigns by controlling the governor’s Middle of the Road political action committee.
“This whole situation is what frustrates Democrats,” Holscher said.
She said Democrats suffered under Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate. In the Senate, the GOP edge stands at 31-9 — the same mix as in 2018. The House GOP majority is 88-37, representing the addition of three Republican representatives since 2018.
“If you take a look, you know, we’ve had the governor’s office the past seven years. We haven’t advanced in terms of growing our numbers. We’ve gone backward,” she said.
Lawrence, who has held a leadership role with the governor’s $2.3 million PAC, made a push during the 2024 elections to alter the balance of power in the Legislature. The Republican supermajority was targeted by Democrats because the GOP’s numerical advantage made it easier to override Kelly’s vetoes. Outcome of the 2024 election was a disappointment for Democrats up and down the ballot, Lawrence said.
 
‘Extremely disappointing’
Holscher notified Lawrence in mid-June about her views on the Kelly administration’s involvement in the development of Democratic campaigns for governor. Holscher sent a text to Lawrence, obtained by Kansas Reflector, that included a warning that Holscher would “swiftly hand over all the proof I have to the press” of the governor’s intervention in Democratic campaigns.
“I am so done with the games coming from you and the governor’s office,” Holscher’s message to Lawrence said. “I want to be very clear about something.”
Holscher vowed she would go to the media if anyone affiliated with the Kelly administration “says anything negative about me or my candidacy,” attempted to interfere with Holscher’s hiring of campaign staff or in signing  up volunteers, “does so much as attempt to put a thumb on the scale in any way to interfere with this election” or made use of the Democratic Governors Association, which is led by Kelly, to “impede or negatively influence” her Democratic primary.
In the interview, Lawrence said language used by Holscher in the text could be interpreted as an attempt to intentionally gain something of value from Lawrence or Kelly against their will.
“It would be worthwhile for Cindy to take a look at the statute and reassess how she communicates with people,” Lawrence said. “Extremely disappointing behavior. Questionable behavior. Not someone who has gubernatorial temperament, who has to compromise and negotiate on things every day in this building.”
In a July social media post after Kelly embraced Corson’s candidacy for governor, Holscher offered an explanation as to why Kelly chose to support Corson.
Holscher wrote pressure had been applied by Lawrence regarding an upcoming vote during the 2025 session on House Bill 2045. It rolled back child care safety standards and tinkered with exemptions to vaccination mandates. Holscher voted against the bill, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan votes and was signed into law by Kelly.
“I had received tons of emails from constituents adamantly opposed to the bill,” Holscher’s post said. “The gov and Will (her chief of staff), told me that if I didn’t support it, the governor’s office wouldn’t be supportive of me in future races. I wasn’t going to go against my district and the people I represent, so I voted ‘no.’ So, it looks like they are holding true to that threat.”
Lawrence said he didn’t agree with Holscher’s analysis of meetings the senator had with the governor about the legislation.
“That vote has nothing to do with the gubernatorial election,” Lawrence said.
 
‘Haven’t paid attention’
Holscher, elected to the House in 2016 and to the Senate in 2020, has been endorsed by former Lt. Gov. Lynn Rogers. He served in Kelly’s first term before appointed to the job of Kansas state treasurer in 2021.
Corson, who entered the Senate in 2021, said in an interview at the Capitol that he appreciated Kelly’s expression of support. It was helpful to voters because Kansans wanted the kind of bipartisan, moderate leadership delivered by Kelly since sworn into office in 2019, Corson said.
He said he hadn’t taken notice of social media chatter about Holscher’s claims of how the Kelly administration handled legislators who declined to fall into line with the governor.
“I just haven’t seen any of that,” Corson said. “I haven’t paid attention to it. We’ve been out there talking to folks and trying to meet people in real life.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources reported Friday that air quality in Iowa will be at levels “unhealthy for sensitive groups” through Saturday, due to smoke from wildfires in Canada. 
The National Ambient Air Quality Standards advise that fine particulate matter should not exceed averages of 35 micrograms per cubic meter in a 24-hour period. 
Air quality monitoring from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow site shows a majority of the state in conditions “unhealthy for sensitive groups” with fine particulate measurements above 40 micrograms per cubic meter. A north-central portion of the state was in unhealthy air quality conditions Friday afternoon, with concentrations greater than 50 micrograms per cubic meter.

DNR said while continuous monitors showed exceedances across most of the state beginning on Thursday, final particulate values will not be available until reference monitors have been manually weighed. 
Older adults, people with heart or lung disease, children and outdoor workers are considered sensitive to particulate matter and are advised to limit their intense outdoor activities. 
The department expects the smoky conditions will remain over Iowa until around midnight on Saturday, though some residual impacts may persist Sunday. 
This is not the first time smoke from Canadian wildfires this summer have drifted down to Iowa. The last significant instance occurred in early June.

(Kate Russell)On Friday afternoon, the New Mexico Department of Health announced that a child from another state had visited New Mexico while infected with measles and might have exposed other people at a few locations in Santa Fe — including the popular interactive Meow Wolf installation: House of Eternal Return.



NMDOH says people may have been exposed during the following times and days at the following locations:
10:45 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., Saturday, July 26, Meow Wolf, 1352 Rufina Circle, Santa Fe
10:00 p.m. Friday, July 25 to 12:30 p.m. Saturday, July 26. The Hampton Inn, 3430 Cerrillos Road, Santa Fe



The department says people who have recently been at any location should check check their vaccination status and report any measles symptoms in the next 21 days to their health care providers.
The out-of-state resident’s infection does not count toward New Mexico’s total measles case count, which remains at 96.
“Summer travel can increase the risk of catching measles,” NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said in a statement. “We urge New Mexicans to be sure they are up to date with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination before traveling.
According to the state, 46,145 New Mexicans received the MMR vaccination between Feb. 1 and July 31.
Measles, one of the most contagious airborne viruses, spreads through contact with droplets from an infected person’ coughs and sneezes. The virus can survive in the air for hours, and can spread days before and after symptoms appear. Additionally, patients can take one to three weeks to develop symptoms such as headache, fever, cough, red eyes and the spotty red rash.
Complications can include ear infections and pneumonia. Health officials urge people with measles to stay home to prevent further spread and contact either a health provider or the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for further guidance.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)This week, Utah joined a growing list of states getting requests for confidential voter roll data from the federal Department of Justice. If these states say “no,” the law, federalism, and election security are on their side. That is exactly what they should do.
Back in March, the Trump administration issued an executive order on election integrity. This order sought to standardize some state election laws and security standards, citing federal laws such as the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act. Among other things, it criticized states for embracing various methods of voting and ballot counting.
Fast forward to today. In recent weeks, states from Maine to California (including my home state of Utah) have gotten letters from the federal Department of Justice requesting private voter information. It has been reported that the DOJ told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it intends to send these letters to all 50 states. These letters cite the Help America Vote Act and suggest that the DOJ is seeking to ensure compliance with this federal law.
The requested information includes descriptions of various state election processes and procedures, as well as a state’s “current statewide voter registration list.” The latter presents a serious problem that jeopardizes legal compliance and election integrity.
Some of the information on voter rolls is public information that is required to be public under federal law. On the other hand, some voter roll information is sensitive, private identifying information.
When it comes to disclosing confidential voter roll information, election officials in Utah and elsewhere should follow the wisdom taught to school children in dealing with people pushing harmful things on them: “Just say no.”
Sound legal analysis puts the law on the side of doing so. The federal Privacy Act of 1974 requires federal departments like the DOJ to provide public notice of any effort to collect data – even publicly available data – to allow public discussion and comment on the desired federal data gathering before it takes place. That hasn’t happened. Additionally, states that share voter roll information with the DOJ without entering into data-sharing agreements required by law may be subject to legal liability.
Just as problematic is how the DOJ request for voter roll information undermines election security by making it easier to commit election fraud.
The foundation of the integrity of American elections lies in our tendency to avoid centralizing authority and information regarding elections – prioritizing federalism over politics. Federal entities create voter equipment standards, states typically maintain voter rolls, local election officials handle and count ballots, and voters themselves ensure their ballot remains secure until it is cast.
In other words, widespread voter fraud in the United States under the current system requires the co-opting of all levels of government or society simultaneously. This is why there is so little concrete evidence of actual voter fraud in America, even with so many elections happening every year. There are anecdotal stories that raise the specter of possible fraud, such as when someone’s friend or relative is sent a ballot that they shouldn’t have gotten, but these stories primarily illustrate how the people themselves are preventing possible fraud.
It is federalism – the disbursed responsibilities and safeguards at every level of government across the nation — not top-down federal attempts like this latest DOJ compliance effort, that ensure election integrity.
How much easier would election fraud become if the DOJ collected all voter data in a central database? Potential fraudsters would breathe a sigh of relief if they only had to hack one federal voter database instead of 50 state voter databases.
Whether based on the law or election security principles, and regardless of which party controls the federal executive branch, states should say “no” to the federal DOJ request for private voter information. They will be protecting election integrity if they do.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Election-Day_40-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 18:56:24.876573

(Photo by Twenty47studio/ Getty Images)Maine Public will “still be here for you tomorrow,” said the organization’s president and CEO, Rick Schneider, after news broke Friday that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be shuttering its doors due to a lack of federal funding.
The announcement came just one day after a major Senate appropriations bill omitted funding for the nonprofit that funds public media and a week after President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that yanked $1.1 billion in previously approved spending for CPB. 
Schneider said while the news is not a surprise, it is still “a very sad day to see that CPB is actually taking the steps to wind down.” 
He said after Congress voted to rescind previously approved public media funding, it was “inevitable, but it is still a blow to see it happening. That said, it’s not the end of PBS programming, or of NPR, or of Maine Public.” 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close its doors after loss of funding

 
Maine Public was slated to receive about $2.5 million in grants from CPB for the coming year and $5 million over the next two years, Schneider said, noting this amounts to 12% of its overall budget. Maine Public will now have to “figure out different ways” to plug that budget hole, he added. 
Since the Trump administration first announced its intentions to claw back public media funding, there has been “an outpouring of support for local public broadcasting stations” nationally and in Maine, Schneider said. 
“We are grateful for all the people stepping up now, and we will have to convince them and let them know that this is support that we will need on an ongoing basis,” he added. He also emphasized his gratitude for the listeners who contacted lawmakers in support of public media.
The state also contributes 9% of Maine Public’s budget, but Schenider explained that covers costs for the extensive network of transmitters across Maine. As the only statewide broadcaster, with seven FM stations, he said the organization is the “backbone” of Maine’s emergency alert system, coordinating with the Maine Emergency Management Agency to get alerts out that are then picked up by commercial broadcasters.
It is not yet clear what CPB’s closure will mean for the out-of-state public radio programming that is picked up by the local broadcaster. Schneider explained that local outlets pay dues to NPR, which make it possible to produce distributed programming, “but if there are less stations, or less stations that can pay those fees, we are all interconnected, and that will be hard.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Chris Jones, the unsuccessful 2022 Democratic candidate for Arkansas governor, will challenge Republican U.S. Rep. French Hill in the 2026 congressional election.
Jones filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on July 21. He has yet to make a formal campaign announcement.
Hill has represented Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District since 2015, encompassing much of Central Arkansas. As of 2022, the district consists of most of Pulaski County and all of Saline, Faulkner, Perry, Van Buren, Cleburne and White counties. Hill and Jones both live in Little Rock, which is split between the 1st, 2nd and 4th congressional districts.

Chris Jones statement of candidacy 
Jones is a pastor and scientist who grew up in Pine Bluff. His first foray into politics was his 2022 gubernatorial candidacy, in which he defeated four Democratic primary opponents but lost the general election, receiving 35% of the vote compared to Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ 63%.
Since then, Jones has co-chaired the national Dirt Road Democrats political action committee. He ran for, but did not win, a vice chair position on the Democratic National Committee.
Hill is a banker and a former aide to Sanders’ father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Hill filed his 2026 statement of candidacy with the FEC in November 2024, shortly after winning reelection to his sixth term.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas called Hill “a rubber stamp to [President Donald] Trump’s extremely unpopular agenda” in a Friday statement on Jones’ anticipated run for Hill’s seat.
“It’s clear: Arkansans deserve better, and it’s no surprise that Democrats are stepping up to make their case to voters,” party spokesperson Micah Wallace said in the news release. “…We’re anticipating a robust primary, and we’re wishing all of the candidates the best on the trail.”
Jones will face Zackary Huffman in next year’s Democratic primary, while Hill will face Chase McDowell in the Republican primary, according to FEC documents.
Last year, Hill defeated Democratic retired Army Col. Marcus Jones, 59% to 41%. Hill also survived challenges from then-state Sen. Joyce Elliott in 2020 and then-Rep. Clarke Tucker in 2018.

Arkansas’ other three U.S. representatives — Rick Crawford of the 1st District, Steve Womack of the 3rd District and Bruce Westerman of the 4th District — also filed FEC statements of candidacy in November.

This story by Emma-Roth Wells was first published in the Valley News on July 30, 2025.
HARTFORD — The Norwich Farmers’ Market and Twin Pines Housing both have big plans for a parcel in Norwich, but in order for those plans to come fruition, the nonprofits need access to Hartford’s water and sewer infrastructure.
Last week, the Hartford Selectboard voted unanimously (outgoing board member Brandon Smith and Chairwoman Mary Erdei were absent) to continue exploring the possibility of allowing the two nonprofits to hook up to Hartford’s infrastructure.
The town has the capacity to support these projects but a study needs to be done, at the nonprofits’ expense, to see whether there needs to be upgrades to the system downstream to ensure no current water and sewer customers would be negatively affected, Chris Holzwarth, Hartford’s assistant director of planning and permitting, said during the meeting.
Allowing Twin Pines and the market to hook-up to Hartford’s infrastructure could be a money maker for the town.
“This is essentially revenue in,” Holzwarth said.
The board’s vote came after it heard a presentation by Andrew Winter, executive director of Twin Pines Housing, and Peggy Allen, board member of the Upper Valley Agricultural Association and co-owner of Junction Fiber Mill.
“We were thrilled the Selectboard was willing to entertain this initial request,” Winter said in a phone interview.
The Upper Valley Agricultural Association, a nonprofit formed by the Norwich Farmers’ Market, has signed a purchase and sale agreement to buy a 35-acre parcel for $750,000 across Route 5 from the market’s current summer location. The aim of the purchase is to give the market a permanent location and more space.
Twin Pines Housing — a nonprofit that develops and manages affordable housing in the Upper Valley — hopes to build approximately 30 affordable rental units on land owned by the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Upper Valley on Palmer Court adjacent to the farmers’ market’s new parcel.
The Unitarian Universalist church’s property is one of two lots in Norwich that is already served by Hartford water and sewer, John Haverstock, Hartford’s town manager, said. The other is The Family Place Parent Child Center, located across the street from the church.
Both nonprofits say access to to Hartford’s water and sewer infrastructure is important to allow the projects to move forward.
Without Hartford’s municipal water and sewer, Twin Pines is prepared to walk away from the Norwich project, Winter said.
“There’s a lot of risk without public water,” he said.
In 2023, Twin Pines applied for a permit to connect to the New London-Springfield Water Precinct system for a 60-unit workforce housing project on Country Road in New London. The precinct denied the project, citing a lack of capacity on the system.
After the denial, Twin Pines drilled five wells before getting one with sufficient water supply, only to find the ground water had been contaminated by a nearby dry cleaning business.
The project is still tied up over water access issues.
“It’s cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Winter said during the meeting. “It’s something that we’re not prepared to undertake again because you don’t know when you’re drilling for wells what you’re going to find.”
The Norwich rental units would be the first of their kind in the town. The town’s affordable housing is limited to Starlake Village, an affordable home ownership program with 14 houses managed by Twin Pines, and 24 units of affordable senior housing owned by the Norwich Housing Corporation, a nonprofit developed in the 1970s, Winter said.
“Folks have said to me frequently that Norwich really needs to do its part,” Winter said during the meeting referring to Norwich’s lack of affordable housing. “We need water and sewer to do that.”
Twin Pines has been discouraged from exploring housing development in Norwich because of the lack of infrastructure, Winter said.
Meanwhile the Farmers’ Market is committed to carrying out plans for a 7,000-square-foot building on the new parcel even without Hartford’s infrastructure. Still, a feasibility study found that building a septic system to support a building of that size on the property would be challenging, Allen said.
The farmers’ market currently leases property from Co-op Food Stores from May to October for its summer market and holds its winter market in Tracy Hall.
Overall, the Farmers’ Market “is an incredible success,” Allen said at the meeting.
The market, which will have its 50th anniversary next year, has up to 2,500 patrons each Saturday in the summer season, Allen said.
For some of the farms that have a regular spot, sales at the market represent 50-75% of their annual income, Allen said. “It is a vital outlet for the farms in our region,” she said.
But the market could be better. “A lot of locals are choosing not to go because the parking is abysmal,” she said. Flooding, cars getting stuck and vendors being “knee-deep in mud” at the summer market is also an issue.
In addition to addressing the parking situation, the plan aims to give vendors “a little more elbow room,” by constructing the building to host the market and agricultural education year-round, Allen said.
“We’re just incredibly excited about the potential to have an open space with parking,” she said.
Allen envisions workshops on how to preserve produce, seminars on invasive species and lessons on how to conserve land all held at the potential building.
“This market that represents the Upper Valley deserves a permanent home,” she said.
Hartford resident Linda Miller spoke out in support of the projects at last week’s meeting.
“This is the first time I’ve heard a proposal for a project from Twin Pines that I’m so excited about,” she said. “It’s answering the question I’ve been asking: Why aren’t other towns stepping forward? And this will be another town stepping forward.”
A former vendor at the Norwich Farmers’ Market, Miller said she has not been to the market this summer because of the lack of parking. “I miss it, so this would be huge if Norwich Farmers’ Market could move across the street and have a little elbow room,” she said.
While both projects are still in the preliminary stages and no final decisions about whether either will be able to use Hartford’s water and sewer have been made, Selectboard member Miranda Dupre expressed her excitement.
“I’m really proud of our town and nonprofits for working across these lines,” she said.
Winter expects studying the feasibility of using Hartford’s water and sewer system for the projects will be completed over the course of the next year.

The report focused on the Conservation Stewardship Program, or CSP, and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, both of which help farmers implement more sustainable practices by helping to cover some of the costs.

EQIP and CSP popular programs 
— Cover crops: A practice of seeding a crop between cash crops cycles to keep roots in the soil. This can improve soil health and keep nutrients and soil in a field rather than washing off.
— Rotational grazing: Ranchers move livestock between multiple pastures to prevent overgrazing. This allows healthy pastures and often a greater diversity of vegetation in the fields as cattle eat, defecate and move plant material around. 
— No till/reduced tillage: Farmers reduce or stop tilling the land which helps to keep nutrients and soil on the field and keeps sequestered carbon in the ground. 

EQIP funding is typically used to support one element, like supplementing the cost of seeding a cover crop on a field, or the cost of fencing for a rancher who wants to implement rotational grazing practices. 
CSP contracts are usually longer than EQIP contracts and require producers to implement multiple regenerative or conservation practices in their operations. 
According to the report, these programs have been historically oversubscribed, with only about 25% of applicants receiving contracts in 2022. 
The Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022, allocated $8.45 billion for EQIP and $3.25 billion for CSP through 2026. 
This allocation significantly increased the funding that was allocated under the 2018 Farm Bill. 
IRA funding meant Iowa had a 77% increase in CSP obligations and a 108% increase in EQIP obligations in 2024 compared to 2022, according to the report. 
“The underlying significance of this data is that Iowa was able to forward 100% of the funding they received for EQIP and CSP from the IRA on to Iowa’s farmers,” Kalee Olson, who authored the report,  said in a release. “It demonstrates the dedication of local (Natural Resources Conservation Service) staff and the willingness of producers to go the extra mile for their operations and our natural resources.”
Contracts funded by IRA had to employ “climate-smart agriculture practices” which the NRCS defined as those that respond “to climate change by reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and adapting and building resilience (adaptation), while sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes.” 
Practices included cover crops, planting pasture or hay, planting in critical areas, no till, prescribed grazing and more.

According to the report, cover cropping and tillage reduction were the most popular methods utilized by Iowa farmers with CSP or EQIP contracts. An analysis in the report shows eight of the top 10 practices implemented by farmers in these contracts in 2023 and 2024 were climate smart practices, regardless of if the project was funded by IRA or not. 
The report said there is “no indication” that interest in the programs will decline, and that the additional funding has made a “significant impact” on the implementation of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state. 
“Moving forward, lawmakers and other federal decision makers must support policy and administrative action that continue to meet the demand of producers in Iowa and across the nation,” the report said. 
The IRA funding was set to stretch through 2031, but much of the law has since been scrapped since the change in administration. 
The tax and spending cuts package known as the “one big beautiful” law rescinded unobligated IRA funding for EQIP, CSP and several other conservation programs with USDA, but it increased the permanent farm bill baselines for the programs. 
Under law, which President Donald Trump signed July 4, EQIP is funded by fiscal year at $2.6 billion for 2026, $2.8 billion for 2027, and $3.2 billion annually from 2028-2031. CSP funding under the bill is at $1.3 billion for 2026, $1.3 billion for 2027, $1.3 billion for 2028, and $1.3 billion annually for 2029 through 2031.
An analysis of the bill from American Farm Bureau Federation said this funding represents a “redirection” of IRA funding rather than program expansions.

It came days after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier threatened the mayor and all six county commissioners that their failure to do so would result in their removal from office by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
“Yeah, we signed the damn thing because we really had to. We were put in a tough spot,” Demings said during a late afternoon press conference in Orlando. “I can’t let our entire board of county commissioners and myself be removed from office.”
Demings signed an addendum to modify the 287(g) Warrant Service Officer (WSO) Memorandum of Agreement that will allow county jail officials to transport immigration detainees to ICE facilities — although he said he still needs to assess the readiness of his corrections department staff to do so while keeping everyone safe at the county jail. He said that there are 212 vacancies within the Orange County corrections department right now, a vacancy rate of 24%.
Speaking in Orlando earlier on Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis said that local governments could apply for grants from the state to reimburse their costs for detaining and transporting detainees. “I think the detention transport, that’s something that would be appropriate to do, and we approved the guidelines for the grants to go out,” he said.
In his letter posted on X earlier this week (which Demings said his office had just received on Friday), Uthmeier wrote that 
	

	rohibiting your corrections officers from transporting arrested aliens to ICE-approved detention facilities squarely prevents your corrections officers from cooperating with ICE and participating in federal immigration operations.”
Failure to back down, he added, would result in removal from office by DeSantis.
Demings, the former chief of police for Orlando who has led Orange County since 2018, said earlier this week that he was not going to allow Uthmeier to “bully” him or other Orange County leaders. But he said on Friday that with the possibility that not signing the addendum would allow DeSantis to “insert his minions,” he really had no choice in the matter.
“I thought it was urgent that we had to take action now to preclude the possibility that the elected body here in Orange County could be removed from office,” he said. “I hope you understand that. That was a calculated risk that we had, obviously. People that had no elected responsibility to our county would be inserted or put in place. That would be catastrophic to the continuity of government here in Orange County. That is something that I certainly did not want to happen.”
Uthmeier and DeSantis have previously asserted that other local governments in Florida that do not fully cooperate with ICE would be defined as employing “sanctuary” policies, which are prohibited in Florida.
In doing so, they ensured that local governments in Fort Myers and Key West ultimately did sign 287(g) agreements with ICE, though in fact cities are not legally required to sign such agreements under Florida law — even if counties are.
Demings said he didn’t understand why state officials had to be so confrontational when it came to enforcing immigration policy in Florida.
“We’re not enemies,” he said. “Local governments are subdivisions of the state. Our state officials in government should act like it. They should remember that we are part of the state of Florida. The state of Florida works best when we work in collaboration, across political lines. The comments I’m making today have nothing to do with partisan politics. It has everything to do with public safety in our community.”
The Orange County Commission must still approve the addendum. Members are scheduled to meet next Tuesday.

(Photo by Daniel Sone/National Cancer Institute)The world’s leading manufacturer of DNA sequencing systems will pay $9.8 million to resolve allegations that it knowingly sold products with security vulnerabilities to federal agencies, Rhode Island’s Acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom announced Thursday.    
The settlement avoids a lengthy court battle for biotech manufacturer Illumina by ending a 2023 suit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island by whistleblower Erica Lenore, a former platform management director at the San Diego company who raised concerns about product security and was eventually let go. 
The $9.8 million settlement allocates $1.9 million to Lenore for initiating the suit and cooperating with federal agencies. Another $4.3 million is specifically labeled as restitution for the government. The company also needs to pay 4.33% interest on the settlement money, backdated to March 2025. 
The settlement text does not specify how the remaining funds are broken down. The court case, which has now been dismissed and unsealed, rested upon the False Claims Act, which allows for prosecution of people and companies who knowingly defraud the government. False Claims settlements typically include money for other penalties or court fees. 
The settlement resolves the government’s civil allegations, and the government has not filed any criminal charges against Illumina, although the settlement allows for future legal action. A separate agreement settles Lenore’s personal civil claims.  
According to the 2023 court filing, Rhode Island’s federal court was eligible for jurisdiction over the case because of a research initiative at the University of Rhode Island — the Rhode Island IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence — that is funded in part by National Institutes of Health grants and used Illumina equipment. 
The lawsuit says that university researchers used the company’s MiSeq line, which was recalled in 2023 over cybersecurity concerns.
Thursday’s settlement was obtained through a joint effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Rhode Island, and the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch and Fraud Section, with additional assistance from other federal investigators.
Among the federal agencies that purchased and used vulnerable Illumina products from 2016 to 2023 were the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, the Interior, Energy, Commerce and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Smithsonian, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
Since 2001, Illumina has received $530 million in direct federal funding, with $43 million in 2022 alone, according to court documents. It also receives pass-through money via Medicare reimbursements, as clinical labs use Illumina systems for genetic testing. 
The security issues in Illumina’s products “allowed thousands of Illumina insiders and everyday users of its products the ability to access and manipulate HIPAA-protected patient genomic data including test results and to do so without detection,” the suit argued. 
Christine Douglass, a spokesperson for Illumina, shared a statement via email Thursday that denied the allegations. The company settled, Douglass wrote, to forego “the uncertainty, expense, and distraction of litigation.” As part of the settlement, it did not admit any wrongdoing. 
“Government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are important customers and Illumina values these relationships,” Douglass said. “Illumina takes data security seriously and has invested significantly in its programs to align with cybersecurity best practices for the development and deployment of our products. We are pleased to put this matter behind us.”
Douglass said that Illumina “successfully remediated” security issues for its customers from 2022 to 2024.

What the lawsuit says 
The 72-page lawsuit explains that Illumina is the only servicer for its products, like the MiniSeq and NextSeq, both of which are named in the suit. Because Illumina is the only servicer for its products across their lifecycle, the company needs to contract with government agencies to provide maintenance as needed. 
The lawsuit alleged these government contracts were violated when it was discovered that Illumina had been selling products with unaddressed security holes, such as human-readable passwords coded into software.
“Illumina improperly hard-coded credentials used to access confidential patient genomic data stored in the cloud, allowing everyday users to see the login information in plain text,” the lawsuit alleged.  
Another vulnerability involved software that was too liberal with elevated privileges for user accounts. That meant that “thousands of everyday users,” could exert considerable control over Illumina systems.
“Illumina has improperly allowed elevated privileges to users running genetic tests on Illumina products that are connected to an open network,” the suit reads. “These users include everyone — research assistants, third-party vendors, laboratory technicians, scientists, clinical investigators, engineers, and research and development staff — individuals who have no need for access to confidential and HIPAA-protected patient data including genomic test results.”
Federal prosecutors strengthened their case for False Claims Act liability with several eyebrow-raising examples that the company was verifying compliance with government standards while knowing otherwise. In 2022, Illumina initiated a product recall only after its customer, the pharmaceutical giant Roche, informed it of a vulnerability in its sequencing software. Roche routinely tests software and hardware it uses for security flaws, but according to prosecutors, Illumina had not performed its own testing on the product in question.     
The lawsuit says that, in another instance, an internal Illumina report noted that a product it was about to launch could most likely be hacked by “a disgruntled ex- or current staff member, with access to the [local] network.” Illumina launched the product three days later and did not disclose the security concerns to the feds.
Lumina did recall products multiple times, but the court complaint calls some of these efforts a “half-truth,” as Illumina allowed different products with the same vulnerabilities to stay on the market.
The company, which made $4.372 billion last year, accounts for about 80% market share of the genomic sequencing industry. Their products are used in research, medicine, and commercial gene testing.
“Illumina’s cybersecurity failures have been driven by its singular goal to maintain its dominant market presence,” the complaint reads. “When faced with customer complaints related to the accessibility of data in its products, Illumina took fatal shortcuts.” 
Whistleblower Lenore — described in the complaint as a “respected professional in the field of life sciences technologies and was hired by Illumina to oversee all of Illumina’s on-market products” — noticed some of these shortcuts during her time at the company, during which she balanced overlapping roles in product management. 
Lenore became concerned about security issues that popped up and repeatedly brought her concerns to higher-ups, but was “ignored, reprimanded, marginalized, and retaliated against by Illumina.” Lenore ultimately lost her job in what the company called a “restructuring,” the lawsuit reads.

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Friday that she’s joined a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s effort to restrict access to medically-necessary care for transgender, intersex and nonbinary youth.
The lawsuit challenges recent federal action to deter doctors and medical providers from offering gender affirming care to youth under the age of 19 years old, including states like Michigan where that care is legal and protected.
Nessel and other attorneys general have asserted that President Donald Trump’s White House is overstepping its authority, using threats of criminal prosecution and federal investigations to pressure health care providers.
“The Trump Administration is attempting to strip away lawful, essential healthcare from vulnerable youth. These orders are illegal and dangerous and have no medical or scientific basis,” Nessel in a statement. “I will continue to protect families, defend doctors, and stop politicians from putting our kids’ lives at risk.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump in the beginning of this second administration signed an executive order stating that the U.S. would only recognize two sexes, and called for an end to what Trump labeled “gender ideology.” A second order focused on medical restrictions, directing the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue enforcement actions related to that care.
Since then, Nessel’s office said the Department of Justice has issued subpoenas to providers under the guise of criminal law enforcement, but the attorneys general filing the lawsuit Friday argue those efforts lack legal standing and are intended only to intimidate.
“Health care decisions for kids should be made by parents and doctors, not by politicians,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group, in a statement. “The federal government is using funding as a weapon to force providers to abandon their patients and override parents’ rights to make health care decisions for their own children.”
Patricia Wells, a doctor and the medical director of The Corner Health Center, said in a statement that she and her colleagues are distressed by new punitive changes to funding and regulations, which threaten to dismantle essential care.
As Trump admin axes LGBTQ+ crisis support, ally parents are offering support for trans youth

“These policies do not protect children; they endanger them,” Wells said. “They undermine trust in the medical system and place affirming providers in an impossible position, forcing hospitals to close clinics and providers to stop offering the very care that helps young people survive and thrive. The loss of these services would not simply be a policy failure; it would be a moral one.”
Wells said the nation must do better. 
“These young people deserve our compassion, our evidence-based care, and our unwavering commitment to their well-being,” she said. “I applaud the leadership of the state of Michigan for protecting transgender and gender nonconforming youth, their families, and the caregivers who are saving lives every day.”

(Providence City Council Photo)Providence City Councilor Helen Anthony announced Friday she will step down from her post Sept. 1, citing her continued recovery from injuries sustained in a serious accident in a California state park two years ago. 
The Ward 2 councilwoman, who chairs the council’s finance committee, announced her resignation in a letter to her constituents Friday.
“As I continue to heal from the traumatic injuries I suffered when I was struck by a van in June 2023, my neurologist has recommended that I devote more time to my recovery,” Anthony wrote. “I’m proud to have served Ward 2 and the City of Providence and to have chaired the council’s Finance Committee. Unfortunately, the demands of those roles is hindering my ability to heal.”
Anthony, who has served on the council since 2019, also submitted a formal resignation letter to the city clerk, which will be on the agenda for the City Council’s next meeting on Sept.4. The City Council is in recess for August.
The council will formally accept Anthony’s resignation at its September meeting, triggering a special election within 90 days, per the city charter. The Board of Canvassers will set the date once the seat is officially declared vacant. 
Ward 2 covers a portion of the capital city’s East Side and includes the neighborhoods of Blackstone, College Hill, and Wayland.
“The residents of Ward 2 have had a wonderful representative; residents of every neighborhood have had a steadfast advocate in Helen,” Council President Rachel Miller said in a Friday statement. “While I will miss her leadership on the council, and in particular her deft stewardship of the Finance Committee, I am proud of her decision to prioritize her health.” 
“As Helen’s colleague and friend, I was in awe of her resilience and tenacity as she recovered from the accident, and I am in awe of the grace with which she is making this difficult decision today,” Miller added.
Anthony was struck by a large, van-sized ATV in a crosswalk at Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, the Boston Globe reported in October 2023. The vehicle’s driver, an 82 year-old park volunteer, had mistakenly hit the gas pedal. Anthony’s extensive injuries — including a brain bleed, broken bones, and a bruised heart — required her to be hospitalized in California for more than two weeks, where she underwent multiple surgeries. She returned to the City Council in October 2023. 
“I take immense pride in the stands I have taken for transparency. It was not always easy, but I have done my best to communicate with you and to represent the city’s long-term interests,” Anthony wrote in her letter to constituents. “This year’s budget was particularly difficult given the financial challenges facing the city. While no single councilor can solve the city’s problems, I am proud that my team and I set a new bar for educating colleagues and residents about how the city’s budget and taxation processes work, and striving to encourage meaningful public input.”
During the transition period after Anthony leaves her post, the City Council Office encourages Ward 2 residents with concerns or questions to call constituent services at (401) 521-7477 or email council@providenceri.gov.

The dwellings would be a mix of rental, for-sale and rehabbed properties in a 770-block area around the streetcar’s initial downtown-midtown route, which is set to be up and running in 2027.
They’re to be targeted to people making under a certain income. And they’ll be built by developers selected by Front Porch Investments, the nonprofit partner the city chose to distribute the millions in the form of grants and low-interest loans.

Friday, Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Jody Holston, Front Porch’s executive director, laid out more details of the vision Ewing shared with the Nebraska Examiner earlier this week. 
It comes as Nebraska towns statewide continue to seek ways to tackle what a 2023 state report deemed a housing crisis. The report said the state’s economic future hinged on solutions, and called for goals including cutting the share of low- to- moderate-income households paying more than 30% of their earnings for rent from about 44% to 33%.
 It’s personal 

Streetcar supporters previously said that affordable housing, bike routes and other mobility improvements would be possible with the tax-increment financing stream the city is counting on to cover its streetcar cost. The city recently increased its estimate of how much the city’s portion of streetcar costs would be, to $421 million.
Ewing said his newly announced strategy — if approved by the necessary channels that include the Omaha City Council — would allow related housing production to start as soon as 2026, years before the 2031 or later that the project’s supporters previously envisioned.
Omaha mayor urges ‘single largest investment’ in affordable housing, with help from streetcar

Beefing up the city’s affordable housing options was an issue Ewing campaigned on, and one he described Friday as personal. He said his own parents weren’t able to buy their first home until he was 15, a sophomore in high school.
“I understand the importance of affordable housing and what it means … when it comes to providing stability for families and children, as well as the opportunity to begin to build generational wealth,” he said.
 Anonymous funder

City officials, during a news conference at City Hall, described the financing strategy this way:
An “anonymous funder” has offered to buy $40 million in city bonds, which the city would grant to Front Porch to start distributing to housing developers.
The city would guarantee payback from tax-increment financing (TIF), tied to the streetcar. TIF is a state-authorized tool that, upon city approval, essentially allows future property taxes generated on an improved site to go toward paying qualified redevelopment expenses.
Steve Jensen, an Omaha mayoral aide, said the city has anticipated that the streetcar will spur $4 billion in new development that’s expected to generate $980 million in new property taxes. He said the city council earlier approved total bond funding of $490 million, and specified that $440 million (and related interest) could go to streetcar construction.

When the private funder buys the $40 million in municipal bonds, it would generate immediate funds, accelerating the ability of the city to spend part of the money on affordable housing. The remaining $10 million would be available, he said, for later housing, biking or mobility projects.
“There will be no citywide property tax rate increase, no money diverted from other city projects and no money used from properties outside the streetcar corridor,” said a city statement. “Only revenue from new or redeveloped income-producing commercial and multi-family properties within the corridor will be used to fund the streetcar, affordable housing  bikeways or other mobility improvements.”
Critics of TIF point out, however, that new property taxes generated on TIF-related development are diverted for up to 20 years from other traditional property tax recipients such as schools and local governments.
 North and South Omaha? 

More specifically, city officials said, the boundaries in which this batch of housing units can be created is Cuming Street to the north, Woolworth/William Streets to the south, the Missouri River to the east and as far as 50th Avenue to the west.
While that does not cover the hearts of North and South Omaha, Holston said Front Porch’s ongoing program currently serves the North and South Omaha areas. Ewing said he hopes to expand farther into North and South Omaha later, but that the boundaries are limited currently to the current TIF streetcar zone and the Urban Core Housing and Mobility Redevelopment Plan that must be amended. 
Holston of Front Porch called the partnership a “perfect example” of what is possible when city leadership and community priorities align. Front Porch has a history with the city, as the former Mayor Jean Stothert administration in 2022 granted the nonprofit $20 million from the city’s share of federal ARPA funds to boost affordable housing options.
Results so far from that fund are the basis for the estimated number of housing units expected to come from the $40 million, 1,900 homes. 
As of July, the city’s ARPA funds, matched by $20 million from philanthropic sources, have led to 2,359 new or rehabbed units, nearly 1,700 of which are described as affordable. About $5 million from the original fund remains.

What is affordable? Holston said the projects Front Porch selects for funding typically are restricted for 20 years for people who make under a certain income.  Eligible income levels can vary, she said, but homes generally would be limited to households making 30% to 80% of the area’s median income, and others to those earning 80% to 120% of median income.
 ‘Uniquely positioned’

Holston said Front Porch is “uniquely positioned” to partner in the venture, as it has been working for four years to close the local affordable housing gap.
“The cost of building any type of housing continues to increase due to construction costs, labor, interest rates, insurance,” she said. Without gap funding, developers and housing advocates are hard-pressed to find ways to make homes available to lower-income and working families.
She said stable housing offers benefits including enhanced educational and health outcomes and worker retention.
“We have the opportunity to ensure that families can meet their basic needs while setting them on a course toward financial stability,” Ewing said. “I’m so excited we’ll be able to do it at this scale and at this time.”

However, the microscopic mussel veligers were not detected in the water near Twin Falls until late September in both 2023 and 2024. ISDA treated the infected river with a copper-based solution both years.
“Monitoring efforts in the Snake River are ongoing and remain a top priority. While early negative results are a good sign, long-term monitoring is essential to determine the full effectiveness of treatments,” according to an ISDA press release.
The department has collected over 200 negative samples from the affected area this season, the press release said.
The department said it has collected more than 2,500 water samples statewide this year to test for quagga mussels.
The Idaho Fish and Game Commission on April 15 rescinded their closure of the Snake River near Twin Falls to hunting, fishing, and trapping. The closure had been in place since September 29, 2023.
All watercraft entering or moving throughout the state must be clean, drained, and dry to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.
All watercraft entering or exiting the section of the Snake River between Broken Bridge (Yingst Grade) and Hansen Bridge must undergo mandatory inspection prior to launch and decontamination upon exit.
According to ISDA, the Centennial Waterfront Park, Shoshone Falls, and Twin Falls Reservoir check stations have completed over 16,361 inspections so far this year.
“Our roadside watercraft inspection stations along with our roving crews have completed more than 112,479 inspections,” the department noted. “We are on track to break our record of 157,356 inspections from 2024.”

Five months after President Donald Trump announced he was nominating a former Wyoming game warden to lead the federal agency, the confirmation process is complete. 
The post Trump’s pick Nesvik confirmed as Fish and Wildlife director with some bipartisan support appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s former top wildlife official is now the nation’s top wildlife official.
It’s a post that puts Brian Nesvik in charge of achieving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s mission, which is to “conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.”
Confirming Nesvik was a protracted process, not unusual for the Trump administration’s other political nominees in the opening half year of the administration. At around 1 p.m. Friday, however, a vote materialized and Congress’ upper chamber voted mostly along party lines 54-43 to confirm the nomination.  
Two western state Democrats defected from the pack and voted to confirm Nesvik: Sen. Jacky Rosen of  Nevada and Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.

All Republican senators who were present for the roll-call vote submitted an aye, which was not surprising. In many circles, and especially in Wyoming, Nesvik’s appointment was received favorably. 
“There simply has never been a more qualified Director for the agency,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement issued shortly after the Senate’s vote on Friday. “He brings decades of wildlife expertise, a collaborative approach to addressing complex issues, and exemplary leadership to the role.”

Gordon named Endangered Species Act reform and grizzly bear delisting as top issues he’s eager to take on with his former Game and Fish director at the helm of the federal agency. 
Sen. Cynthia Lummis, Wyoming’s junior senator, also broadcast her praise, calling Nesvik a “breath of fresh air.” 
“Brian brings a proven track record from Wyoming, where he effectively collaborated with federal, state and local partners to achieve important conservation goals,” Lummis said in a statement. 
Praise for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s new director isn’t universal. Around the time of his first confirmation hearing, where Nesvik fielded little criticism, a coalition of 125 organizations signed onto a letter opposing his nomination. The oppositional parties included the Wyoming-based organizations Wyoming Untrapped and Wyoming Wildlife Advocates.
“In 2024, Nesvik faced major national blowback after his agency failed to take strong action against a man who ran over a young female wolf with his snowmobile,” the letter stated. “Mr. Nesvik’s lackadaisical response to the tormenting of the young Wyoming wolf speaks volumes about his lack of care for wildlife and is a foreshadowing of the attitude he will bring to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.” 
A development in that case came just this week: Sublette County law enforcement officials are convening a grand jury to consider a felony animal cruelty indictment of the wolf captor, Cody Roberts.

A longtime member of the Wyoming Army National Guard, Nesvik rose through the ranks at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department after being hired as a warden in 1995. After wardening stints in Casper, Elk Mountain and Pinedale, he took a post supervising the state agency’s Cody Region in 2010. He also spent many years working as Game and Fish’s lead mounted horse patrol instructor. 
A promotion to chief warden brought Nesvik to Cheyenne in 2011, and in 2019, he was promoted by Gordon to direct Game and Fish. He retired last fall. 
The U.S. Senate delayed its summer recess this week to make progress on reducing a long list of appointees — more than 100 positions  — who lacked confirmation. The sluggishness of the approvals has been a source of frustration for the Republicans who hold the majority. 
Nesvik is joined by another Wyomingite at the Trump administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service. Josh Coursey, a co-founder of the Muley Fanatic Foundation, was named senior advisor to the director in April. That position did not require a Senate confirmation. 
The duo will have their work cut out for them in running a federal agency that struggled mightily with a lack of resources even before Trump’s friend-turned-foe, Elon Musk, slashed into the staff through his Department of Government Efficiency. A recent inventory from within the Fish and Wildlife Service found that out of 573 national wildlife refuges around the country, not a single property had adequate staff and funding to “fully achieve administration, management and mission goals and objectives.”

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) A Cass County assisted living center is one of several care facilities recently fined by the state in the wake of medication errors, injuries and a death.
State records indicate that on July 8, a male resident of Allen Place, an assisted living center in Atlantic, was left unattended in the shower where he slipped and fell, suffering a head injury. He was taken to by ambulance to a hospital, where he died a short time later.
According to the state inspectors, a non-skid bathmat was not in place in the shower at the time of the incident, and the worker tasked with showering the man was not properly trained and wasn’t assisting the man in the shower.

The worker in question had been on the staff for roughly one month. In a written statement referenced by inspectors in their report, the worker indicated he didn’t understand that the resident needed physical assistance standing and showering and so he sat a few feet away from the bathroom while the resident showered. Within a minute of the resident entering the shower, the worker reportedly wrote, the man fell.
“I lacked the proper training on the proper stand-by procedure,” the worker allegedly wrote in his statement. “Due to this lack of training, I thought the shower mat that’s normally down — but was up that day — should remain up.” … and “once [Tenant C1’s] in the bathroom, I leave the bathroom as to what I was taught before and leave the door half open while I sit in a nearby chair … Around a minute into the shower he falls.”
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing fined Allen Place $10,000.
Other Iowa care facilities recently fined by the DIAL include:
— Hallmar Village, a Cedar Rapids nursing home where a resident sustained two broken legs while being transferred to bed in a mechanical lift, was fined $20,500 by the state. The resident was facing amputation of one leg before being assigned to hospice care a few days later, according to state records.
Inspectors reported that one employee of the home, a certified nursing assistant, indicated the staff at the home had been using a modified method of using the mechanical lift with the resident that involved the use of a pillow and avoided the use of leg straps intended for safe transfers. The CNA reportedly told inspectors she felt the modifications by the staff posed a risk to the resident and said she relayed her concerns to a nurse.
The CNA also told inspectors that because the transfer process looked unsafe, she asked to work a different floor at the home. A state review of training records indicated the nurse and two CNAs at the home “did not have training on the use of a mechanical lift,” according to inspectors.
— Bickford Cottage I, a Sioux City assisted living center, was fined $7,000 after a resident wandered from the facility on July 5 and wasn’t found for several hours. The resident was admitted to a local hospital due to acute kidney injury, dehydration and elevated creatine levels.
— Windsor Manor, a Grinnell assisted living center, was fined $5,000 after a male resident of the home was given seven separate medications intended for someone else. The resident who was mistakenly given the drugs became unresponsive and was admitted for a short time to a local hospital.
— Azria Health-Longview, a Missouri Valley nursing home, was fined $7,000 after a resident fell on June 30 and sustained a serious head injury. Inspectors noted the facility was to have placed non-skid strips near the resident’s bed, but the work order calling for that to be done included the wrong bed number. The resident suffered multiple facial fractures and had to be hospitalized. As of July 16, the resident was still hospitalized.
— Bickford Cottage, an Iowa City assisted living center, was fined $5,000 after a female resident wandered from the facility about 8 p.m. on June 1. About one hour later, an off-duty paramedic found the woman 1.3 miles from the facility.

This week, Montana added to that history by beginning the constitutional initiative process aimed at challenging dark money, corporate spending and the Citizens United ruling.
Leaders who have signed on the measure admit: They have a steep hill to climb. Citizens United, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, said that the power to spend money in elections is tantamount to free speech and so most attempts to thwart or limit it have run afoul of the U.S. Constitution and the nation’s highest courts.
However, the wording of the new initiative seeks to limit the amount of money corporations can spend – not through traditional campaign laws or limitations, but rather by limiting corporate charters.
The new and untested method would leverage the state’s inherent power to regulate corporates through the charter process. The language of the proposed state constitutional amendment would prohibit corporations from making political contributions, except in very specific circumstances. Meanwhile, individuals would be free to spend on candidates and causes.
The idea, said Jeff Mangan, a former Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, is conservative in nature: The state has the power to put limits on the corporations it charters to do business in the state; this one would simply not allow them the power to participate in elections directly, while still leaving a path for political action committees.
The key, Mangan said, is about transparency. He said the current system allows private corporations to be established and collect money, but to keep those donors and the amounts hidden from public view. Those corporations, which can consist with as few as one donor, can give to candidates and causes under the corporation name, although the people supporting that corporation and the amount of money donated are unknown, leading to the term “dark money.”
The change in Montana law would simply not grant the corporations the power to give to candidates or causes, but would allow individuals to give, but those donations would be tracked.
The proposed legislation is the first-of-its-kind and takes a different approach to the problem of campaign finance in spending. For example, last year’s U.S. Senate race in Montana, which saw Republican Tim Sheehy beat incumbent Democrat Jon Tester, had more than $275 million spent in a state of roughly 1.2 million people.
“Basically the only difference is that corporations won’t be able to spend in our elections,” Mangan said.
The specifics of the proposed constitutional amendment would carve out exceptions for organizations like political parties and even media organizations whose coverage could possibly run afoul of the amendment’s language.
“If a person wants to spend money, then they have to put their name on it. It’s full disclosure. That’s what this is all about,” Mangan said.
Constance Van Kley, an assistant professor at the University of Montana law school, said it’s unknown whether this idea will get around the Citizens United ruling, as well as clear the First Amendment, but she said it nonetheless attempts a new solution.
“There’s nothing that I am aware of that squarely forecloses it, though,” Van Kley said.
She teaches constitutional law in Missoula and said that since the United States Supreme Court has said that money equals political speech, and political speech is the most protected part of free speech. Many campaign finance laws have been evaluated in terms of whether they restrict, prohibit or curtail free speech. However, Van Kley said, this initiative is different and limits corporations using the power states have inherently in their power to issue a charter.
“The question that has not been decided to my knowledge is whether this can get by the First Amendment,” she said.
Mangan told the Daily Montanan it eliminates the vaguely named organizations, which often become nothing more than shields to hide where the money is coming from.
“This is not limiting anyone’s speech. They have the right to do whatever they want with their money, they just have to put their name to it,” Mangan said. “But it has to come from individuals. And, I think the individuals — the rank-and-file folks — they are tired of the money in politics and they’re just waiting for someone to do something about it.”
He said because of the Citizens United decision and its connection to free speech and the First Amendment, many believe the solution to the dark money in politics is insurmountable.
“Many citizens are just resigned. You know: It is what it is,” Mangan said. “People are born, but corporations are created with rights by a piece of paper and pen. That means that states can change corporate rules the same way. States have always had the right to change charters.”
Mangan said he expects opposition from corporations who like putting money into campaigns to protect their business interests. However, people who work for companies or corporations may not like or support their employer’s political decisions. This initiative, Mangan said, would stop that.
Van Kley said that this measure is different because not many politicians have been actively fighting against the Citizens United ruling because the decision has meant a tidal wave of money pouring into both parties, despite the public being opposed to the ruling. Van Kley said the movement to change campaign financing has not had state legislatures and politicians chipping away at it like the countless challenges to other issues, like abortion, which finally chiseled it away enough to lead to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. She said that makes this particularly constitutional initiative a challenge to predict because so much of it has not been explored by the courts.
“Especially in Citizens United, most people have thought that the only pushback to it would be by an amendment (to the U.S. Constitution) because it involves freedom of speech,” Van Kley said. “Is it the first step to rethinking First Amendment and campaign finance law?
The initiative has several major hurdles to clear before it would even get in front of the voters. The language must first be approved and checked with the Attorney General’s Office. Then initiative supporters must collect signatures throughout the state, a daunting task because of the requirements. The initiative will take about 63,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, so Mangan said they’ll likely need to aim for double that amount just to ensure those signatures can all be verified.
“We trying to get things back to the way they were,” he said. “We tell them right up front, we’ll be transparent with our donors for anyone who ask. Montanans shouldn’t have to do this. It shouldn’t cost this much. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican, it just doesn’t make sense.”
Van Kley also sees this initiative as a bit of history repeating itself.
“Montana and Alaska,” she said. “They have been the places that have had incredibly rich natural resource and not a lot of people, which has made them victims of extraordinary political corruption, historically.”
 



 
 THE MONTANA PLAN PROPOSED BALLOT STATEMENT 


CI ____ would amend Article XIII of the Montana Constitution to redefine the powers of artificial “persons,” including corporations. It defines their powers as only those the constitution expressly grants and provides that artificial persons have no power to spend money or anything of value on elections or ballot issues. It affirms that the people of Montana never intended for artificial persons to have the power to spend on elections or ballot issues. CI ____ provides that actions beyond those expressly granted powers are void. The initiative permits political committees to be granted the power to spend on elections and ballot issues. It allows enforcement through forfeiture of state-conferred privileges. The initiative includes a clause that ensures that valid portions of the initiative remain effective even if other parts are invalidated.
 



 





 THE COMPLETE TEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVE NO. *** (CI-***)


BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
NEW SECTION. Section 1. Article XIII of The Constitution of the State of Montana is amended by adding a new section 8 that reads:

Section 8. Powers of Artificial Persons.
(1) Artificial Persons exist only by grant of the state and shall have no powers or privileges except those this constitution expressly provides.

(2) (a) The legislature may by statute create Artificial Persons consistent with subsection (1).
(b) The people never did, and do not, intend the powers of Artificial Persons to include Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity. This section retracts all Artificial Persons’ powers and re-grants only those powers that the people deem necessary or convenient to carry out an Artificial Person’s lawful business or charitable purposes, as described in (3)(e). Powers related to Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity shall not be deemed necessary or convenient to those purposes.

(3) Definitions.


(a) “Artificial Person” means every entity whose existence or limited-liability shield is conferred by Montana law, including, without limitation:

(i) business corporations;
(ii) nonprofit corporations (public-benefit, mutual-benefit, religious);
(iii) limited-liability companies;
(iv) unincorporated associations, limited-liability partnerships, statutory trusts, professional corporations, cooperatives, and any successor form;
(v) Foreign Entities that are authorized to transact business, are otherwise transacting business, or hold property in Montana. Any Foreign Entity that directly or indirectly undertakes, finances, or directs Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity in the state of Montana is conclusively deemed to be transacting business in this state.


(b) “Election Activity” means paying, contributing, or expending money or anything of value to support or oppose a candidate, political party, or political committee.
(c) “Ballot-Issue Activity” means paying, contributing, or expending money or anything of value to support or oppose a ballot question or initiative.
(d) Election Activity and Ballot-Issue Activity do not include any bona fide news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, or of any print, online, or digital newspaper, magazine, blog, or other periodical publication, unless such broadcasting, print, online, or digital facilities are owned or controlled by a political party, political committee, or candidate.
(e) “Artificial Person Powers” means powers necessary or convenient to carry out lawful business or charitable purposes, excluding any power to directly or indirectly engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity.
(f) “Charter Privilege” means any benefit to Artificial Persons that exists only because the state of Montana confers it, such as, without limitation, limited liability, perpetual duration, succession in its corporate name, and tax credits and abatements.
(g) “Foreign Entity” means an Artificial Person organized or existing under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of Montana.


(4) Total Revocation of Previous Power Grants.

(a) The creation and continued existence of an Artificial Person is not a right but a conditional grant of legal status by the state and remains subject to complete withdrawal at any time. All powers previously granted to any Artificial Person under Montana law are revoked in their entirety. No Artificial Person operating under the jurisdiction of this state shall possess any power unless specifically granted by this constitution. No provision of this constitution grants or recognizes any power of an Artificial Person to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity, except as provided in (5)(c).
(b) Transitional Safe Harbor. Nothing in (4)(a) shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or modify any existing contract, debt instrument, security, or other legal obligation validly entered into before the effective date of [this act]; provided, however, that nothing herein authorizes any Election Activity or Ballot Issue Activity after the effective date.



(5) Selective Re-Grant of Artificial Person Powers.

(a) Each Artificial Person possesses the powers defined in (3)(e), unless its organizational documents limit the exercise of such powers, and no powers beyond those expressly granted. No provision of this constitution grants or recognizes any power of an Artificial Person to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity, except as provided in (5)(c).
(b) Any language in articles of incorporation, organization, association, or other organizational documents purporting to directly or indirectly confer Election-Activity authority or Ballot-Issue-Activity authority to Artificial Persons is void.
(c) Political committees registered under Montana or federal law are entities created for the purpose of engaging in Election Activity and Ballot-Issue Activity. Such committees may be granted the power to engage in those activities provided that they exist solely for that purpose and claim no Charter Privilege other than limited liability. This constitution does not grant any other Artificial Person the power to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity.
(d) No Charter Privilege shall be construed to authorize Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity. An Artificial Person that exercises Election-Activity authority or Ballot-Issue-Activity authority, unless expressly permitted to do so under (5)(c), initially forfeits all Charter Privileges as a matter of law. The legislature shall, during its first regular session following the effective date of [this act], enact procedures that allow reinstatement upon full disgorgement, certification of compliance, and payment of civil penalties.


(6) Ultra Vires Actions. Any Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity conducted by an Artificial Person is ultra vires and void. Such conduct results in the forfeiture of Charter Privileges as provided in (5)(d) and shall also be subject to civil action by a member, shareholder, or the attorney general for injunctive relief, disgorgement, and confirmation or enforcement of the forfeiture. The legislature shall, during its first regular session following the effective date of [this act], enact procedures for such civil actions.
(7) Severability. If any provision of [this act], or its application to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remaining provisions and applications that are severable shall remain in effect. In such event, no prior grant of corporate powers shall be revived or reinstated, nor shall any court construe [this act] to authorize broader powers than are expressly conferred in [this act].

NEW SECTION. Section 2. Effective date. [This act] is effective January 1, 2027.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dollar-wave.jpg,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069

Blatchford (Diné) — a photographer, artist and activist — told Source New Mexico in an interview that the complicated and obscure world of uranium mining can make activism difficult, especially given that the legacy of uranium mining in Indigenous communities here started as a clandestine project. 
“It feels intimidating. And I think that was the intention of the federal government, to make it this censored thing, because it was a secret to begin with,” she said.

The exhibit opening at Center is today from 5 to 7 p.m. The exhibit runs until Aug. 26. 
The counter mapping workshop is Aug. 14 from 5 to 8 p.m.

The Friday opening of the Anti-Uranium Mapping Project at CENTER in Santa Fe seeks to, among other objectives, counteract that censorship and intimidation. And it represents a grand unveiling of years of intense work and lifelong curiosity about Blatchford’s roots to the Navajo Nation and its landscape. 
While she’s given various presentations and held exhibits in other states, the homecoming to CENTER is the first time she’s had full creative control over how the project is displayed. And it’s in Santa Fe, where she has lived more than a decade.
The exhibit opens amid a renewed push for uranium mining in New Mexico and shortly after the Navajo Nation reached an agreement with Energy Fuels, a global mining company, to transport uranium across the nation from a mine near the Grand Canyon to a mill in Utah. 
On the New Mexico side of the Navajo Nation, the federal government has recently prioritized several uranium mine proposals here that have been pending for more than a decade. The projects are near Mount Taylor, a sacred mountain to several pueblos in New Mexico, as well as the Navajo people. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Blatchford moved to Santa Fe from California more than a decade ago to attend the Santa Fe Institute of Art and Design. After her mother began a genealogical investigation into her birth parents in the early 1990s, Blatchford as a child visited Santa Fe and reconnected with her aunt and uncle on the Navajo Nation. 
Her interest in the hidden world of uranium mining began shortly after she moved here for college. Once settled, she began poring over satellite imagery of the Navajo Nation to find her aunt’s house, where she had idyllic memories of visiting as a kid. 
“I was just trying to get to my aunt’s house from memory without having to call my mom and get directions. And through that, I was on Google Earth, and that’s when I found this, like, weird black smear, and kind of, like, geometric shapes in the landscape beyond the hills where I remember going on that motorcycle ride with my uncle.”
The “smear” was a giant coal mine, she said. The horror of that discovery led her down a rabbit hole that eventually ended at uranium. Since at least 2011, she’s been gathering photos and maps and stories, along with compiling resources, for a website and in-person exhibit.
Navajo advocates say prez’s approval of uranium transport, Trump coal order feels like a betrayal

Part of her goal is to reclaim the maps used as a tool to plunder resources. Maps are central to the public’s understanding of uranium, she said, but they are also “top down” and “clinical,” showing enforced borders and sterile data. 
“But I feel like, once you come down to the 45-degree angle, and you see the landscape, you get this middle ground of information between the two worlds,” she said. “ And I feel like intuitively, you just have more of a connection and empathy is being instilled. As you’re gathering new information, you’re still kind of grounded somehow.”
Visitors can expect that immersive view of the landscape and people, including photos and videos, and educational material as part of the month-long exhibit. It will focus primarily on the Church Rock spill of 1979. 
On Aug. 14, Blatchford will also host a “counter mapping workshop.” As part of that, she asks participants to annotate top-down maps of the Four Corners region, with the boundaries of tribes and pueblo reservations outlined. 
Among the questions she asks: 
“Have you or someone you know been impacted by uranium mining? If so, please mark the location on the map and write what feels comfortable to share,” and;
“How have maps enforced colonial conquest and the imposition of capitalist property relations around the world?”
A participant at a recent workshop at the University of New Mexico responded: “Maps carry the sense of ‘free land’ that must be ‘claimed’ by people of power who don’t care about community and respect, but rather see land and want it for the power and resources.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Church_Rock_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069

Free.,‘A gun to a knife fight’: Democrats' chief pledges a more pugnacious party in more states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gun-knife-fight-democrats-chief-pledges-more-pugnacious-party-more-states,,"PORTLAND, Oregon — Democrats must be more aggressive organizers and campaigners to win back the working-class coalition they have increasingly lost to President Donald Trump, according to Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin.Too often in recent decades, the party has ceded ground to Republicans, Martin told States Newsroom in a one-on-one July 31 interview during a stop on a visit to community groups, activists and fundraisers in Oregon.Since 2009, the national party’s infrastructure has deteriorated, allowing the GOP to build organizational advantages across the country, define Democratic candidates before they can define themselves and put too many states out of reach, he said.In sometimes more pugnacious terms than might be expected from someone with Martin’s clean-cut corporate look and Midwestern demeanor, he said his task as party leader is to reverse that trend.“We’re not here to tie one of our hands behind our back,” Martin said. “In the past, I think our party would bring a pencil to a knife fight. We’re going to bring a gun to a knife fight.”The knife-fight analogy was an answer to a question about how Democrats should respond to Texas Republicans redrawing congressional district lines as the GOP struggles to keep its slim U.S. House majority, but it could apply to other aspects of Martin’s vision for the party.Martin, whom Democrats elected in February to lead them for the next four years, said Democrats should never turn off their messaging and campaigning apparatus, and work to build party infrastructure in regions, states and cities where they have not competed in decades.Over 45 minutes, he invoked the late U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal whose populist approach to campaigning and governing practically sanctified him among Democrats in Martin’s native Minnesota, several times and indicated Wellstone would be an effective model for Democrats in 2024 and beyond.“I think what the American people are looking for is people who are going to stand up and fight for what they believe in,” he said. “People didn’t always agree with Paul Wellstone all the time, but they still voted for him. They said … ‘He’s not one of these finger-in-the-wind politicians. He’s standing up for what he believes, and I’m going to give him credit for it even if I don’t agree with him on a particular issue.’ They want authenticity.”Texas redistrictingThe day after Texas Republicans released a map of proposed new congressional districts in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort that could net them five more U.S. House seats, Martin implied he would support blue-state leaders who retaliated with their own maps to give Democrats an advantage — even as he disparaged the move by Republicans.He called the redistricting effort “a craven power grab” by Trump and Republicans, accusing them of “trying to rig the system.”“If they can't win on their own merits, they're going to cheat and steal,” he said. “That's essentially what they're doing right now.”But, even as Martin condemned those moves, he said Democrats should feel empowered to respond in kind. “We can’t be the only party that’s playing by the rules,” he said.Leading Democrats in California, New York and Illinois have openly explored the possibility of emergency redistricting if the proposed Texas map becomes final, even though the issue has raised the ire of some usual allies who support less partisan election infrastructure.The national party would be “very involved” in challenging the Texas map, as well as working with governors seeking to change their own maps, Martin said.Never stop campaigningMartin brought up, unprompted, some of the challenges his party faces.Twice as many voters had an unfavorable view of Democrats as a favorable one in a July Wall Street Journal survey that showed the party with only 33% of support.Voters now see Republicans as the party of working-class voters and Democrats as representatives of the elite, Martin said. In the 2024 election, the party did worse with nearly every slice of the electorate other than college-educated voters and wealthy voters.Martin noted Trump made historic inroads with some traditional Democratic constituencies, earning a higher share of Latino, Black, Asian and Pacific Islander, young and working-class voters in 2024 than any Republican candidate in years.That result was part of an ongoing trend going back 20 years, Martin said, and represents an existential threat to the Democratic party.“We lost ground with every part of our coalition,” he said. “If we continue to lose ground with working people in this country, with all of the other parts of our coalition, we’re toast. We’ve got to reverse course.”Democrats’ slide with those constituencies is in part “a branding issue,” permitted by the party’s willingness to let Trump and other Republicans’ campaigning in off-years go unanswered and a lack of a positive message articulated to voters, said Martin.“We didn’t start our campaign until the spring of 2024 — way too late,” he said. “I would argue that they had already defined us before we ever had a chance to define ourselves. That can never happen again. Never, ever, ever. So that means we have to be campaigning all the time, year-round. Year-round organizing, year-round communications. We never stop talking to voters. We never stop campaigning.”‘We all do better’That campaigning should be focused on a positive view of what Democrats offer voters and include an appeal to “the vast majority of Americans, not just the people at the top.”“We have to fix our brand,” Martin said. “We have to give people a sense that we're fighting for them. We have to stand up and fight with everything we have right now, not just against Donald Trump, but for something. We have to give people a positive vision of what their lives would look like with Democrats in charge.”Democrats’ message should be about a rising tide lifting all boats, Martin said, quoting Wellstone, for whom Martin, 52, interned at the beginning of his career and still considers an inspiration.“Remember Paul’s famous slogan: ‘We all do better when we all do better,’” he said. “That should be the slogan of the Democratic Party.”He praised Zohran Mamdani, the winner of New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, for running an energetic campaign that was focused on showing how he could improve New Yorkers’ lives.That should include a policy focus on affordability, health care access and a government that works for people beyond the elite.But even as Martin articulated the positive message he said Democrats should focus on, he slipped into slamming Trump and Republicans, saying the tax and spending cuts law Trump signed last month would take health care away from people. The law was among the least popular in decades, he noted.There was room for both a positive campaigning and highlighting Republicans’ unpopularity when appropriate, said Martin.“It’s a both/and,” he said. “Let’s tell folks what is happening and let’s tell folks what Democrats are going to do.”Senate in reach?The unpopularity of Republicans’ law, which is projected to cut more than $1 trillion over 10 years from Medicaid, food stamps and other programs while lowering taxes on high earners, gives Democrats an opening in a difficult cycle for U.S. Senate races, Martin said.Democrats — who control 47 seats, including two independents, compared to 53 for Republicans, who also hold a tie-breaking vote in Vice President JD Vance — need to net four additional seats in next year’s elections to win the majority in the chamber, which Martin said was possible under the right circumstances.That view is out of step with current projections, which show Democratic seats in Georgia and Michigan at least as likely to flip as Republican seats in North Carolina and Maine. Democrats would have to win all four of those most competitive races, plus two that would be further stretches, to gain a majority.Beyond North Carolina and Maine, Martin said the map to Democrats’ regaining the Senate would go through traditionally red states.Iowa, where incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst could be vulnerable, and Alaska, where former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola would be a strong challenger to incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan, could be Democrats’ 50th and 51st Senate seats, he said.Or, if right-wing primary challengers defeat more establishment incumbents in Louisiana and Texas, those states could turn into pickup opportunities, he said — though Trump won both states easily, by more than 20 points in the former.Growing the party, growing the mapTo win next year and beyond, Democrats must unify, he said.Elements of the party that would impose purity tests on others — whether that’s progressives excluding moderates or vice versa — make that harder, he said.“I believe you win elections by addition, not subtraction,” he said. “You win by bringing in people, new voices, and growing your coalition.”Martin also wants to grow the map and compete across the country, using a strategy pioneered by former DNC Chair Howard Dean, who was chair from 2005 to 2009.When President Barack Obama’s political team took control of the party apparatus in 2009, it “completely eviscerated” the state party infrastructure Dean had built, Martin said.Earlier this year, he announced an initiative to provide at least $1 million a month to all state parties. The goal is to expand the number of competitive states and districts, reversing a trend that has seen fewer presidential contests focused on fewer states.“There's no such thing as a perpetual red state or a perpetual blue state,” he said. Turning states from Republican strongholds to competitive, or from competitive to favoring Democrats — or even to maintain Democratic strength — takes investment of money and energy, he said.“It's critical, and it's something I firmly believe in,” he said. I've seen for so many years our national party and other party committees not making the investments to actually call themselves a national party,” he said. “You can't be a national party if you're just competing in seven states.”",,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069

(Photo credit Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Tallahassee’s most famous prisoner is no longer here.
Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of notorious financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — and his  convicted co-conspirator — has been moved from the federal prison in Florida’s capital city to a minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas.
David Oscar Markus, Maxwell’s Florida lawyer, confirmed in an email that Maxwell had been moved but declined all further comment. Maxwell’s relocation — which happened on Thursday — was first reported by the New York Sun.
It was just last week that Maxwell met with highly placed officials from the U.S. Department of Justice as calls have grown for the release of all files related to Epstein. Epstein died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges for sex trafficking minors. He pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida to procuring and soliciting minors for sex.
Before they entered office, several officials in the administration of President Donald Trump had vowed to open the Epstein files amid speculation about the true nature of his death and his associates. But then, in early July, Attorney General Pam Bondi and others insisted that he had killed himself and that there was no incriminating “client list.”
The uproar over that assertion eventually prompted Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to meet with Maxwell inside the federal courthouse located about four miles from the federal prison where she was incarcerated.
Last week Markus, who is with the firm Markus/Moss PLLC, told reporters that during that meeting that Blanche “asked a lot of questions, and Ms. Maxwell answered every single question. She never invoked a privilege, she never declined to answer.”
Members of Congress had also been pushing to talk to Maxwell but earlier this week it was reported that Maxwell’s attorney told Congress that she needed immunity or a reduction in her 20-year sentence. She also wanted to push her testimony until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on her pending appeal.
On Friday, POLITICO reported that Rep. James Comer, chair of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, had agreed to indefinitely postpone her testimony but said Congress would not offer her immunity.
Some Trump opponents lashed out at the decision to transfer Maxwell, saying her new home is a “cushy” location and questioned why a “registered sex offender” would be moved unless she has a deal pending with the Trump administration.
“They have put herself somewhere that is very, very comfortable,” said long-time Trump critic Rick Wilson on a video he put out on Friday afternoon. “Ghislaine Maxwell being moved to the cushiest federal prison that there is is not a coincidence. It is not a routine transfer. Something happened here that caused this to occur.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)South Dakota’s secretary of state is taking responsibility for the release of sensitive voter registration data, after her office published a spreadsheet that labeled thousands of residents as having registered to vote at government assistance agencies.
“As Secretary of State, I take full responsibility for the release of this information. My office is committed to both transparency and protecting voter privacy,” Secretary of State Monae Johnson said in a statement. “Upon discovering the issue, we acted immediately to remove the data and prevent further dissemination.”
The data was posted online following the passage of a new law requiring the state’s full voter registration list to be freely available to the public. But among the fields included in the data was “Source of Registration,” which publicly identified people who registered at offices for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or the Women, Infants and Children program. 
In all, 7,186 people were labeled as having registered to vote while applying for public assistance, according to a Searchlight analysis.

This drew criticism from lawmakers and the public alike.
“This is what happens when you put the wrong people in charge,” said state House Minority Leader Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, who voted against the bill. “We talk a lot about freedom and privacy in this state, so it’s a shame that this legislation led to this type of breach.”
The list contains the information of about 668,419 registered voters — their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, party registrations and other personal information.
The South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office “apologizes for the disclosure of information,” according to the statement, and is committed to “restoring public trust following this error.”
While voter registration at a public assistance agency does not necessarily mean a person receives benefits, Johnson said her office will notify affected individuals by mail. She said county auditors have also been contacted, and individuals who accessed the original data will be asked to delete any copies.
The new law, which passed earlier this year with some bipartisan support and went into effect in July, was sold as increasing transparency in elections by making voter registration information accessible without a $2,500 fee. Activists who favor the hand-counting of ballots, oppose the use of vote-counting machines and deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election were among those who promoted the legislation as an “election integrity” measure.
The Secretary of State’s Office said voters with concerns are encouraged to contact the office directly.

While Stand With Trans’ Ally Parents Hotline is not a crisis line, Roz Gould Keith, the organization’s founder, said the group is looking to offer love at the other end of the line. 
“A lot of times people call and they just need someone to hear them, right? They just need someone to call them by their chosen name. They need someone to call them by the right pronouns and they don’t necessarily need more than that,” Keith said. 
Sometimes a caller might need advice on coming out to their parents or information like where to find a chest binder, Keith said, and the support person on the line can help them find those resources even if they are not immediately available. 
Stand With Trans’ mission is to support and empower trans youth and their loved ones, Keith explained, and one way to do that is to ensure parents are knowledgeable and have access to resources and support.

The organization’s Ally Parents program was initially put together in response to the death of Leelah Alcorn, a transgender girl who took her life in 2014 citing a lack of acceptance from her parents. Keith said she was in a Facebook group with other parents of transgender kids, when the idea first came together. 
“We started talking and commiserating, and our hearts were just breaking over this unnecessary tragedy, and we said we have to do something,” Keith said. 
Out of those conversations came Ally Moms, with the group publishing the first names of mothers of trans children, the state where they lived and a phone number where they invited young people to text them for support. 
“There was really nothing out there in the way of resources, and so it was really groundbreaking at the time, and we started getting a lot of texts, and then parents started calling and it kind of expanded,” Keith explained. 
The program became Ally Parents, and expanded to a network of 250 parents across the county in almost every state, Keith explained. 
However, the program became unwieldy, as the organization didn’t have a phone system or a way to process calls, Keith said, with Stand With Trans taking a pause in promoting the program. 

“It was still kind of there in the background. People could see the list on our website, but we didn’t promote it because we really wanted to figure out the best way to secure the calls,” Keith said. 
When Stand With Trans received a grant in 2024, that’s when the hotline came into play, Keith said. The group was able to hire two co-coordinators who Keith said found the perfect platform to host the hotline. 
“People can text or call the toll free number, and it’s for youth, it’s for adult caregivers, really anybody that needs to talk to an ally parent. And so this way it just kind of routes through to the next available person. So it just makes a lot more sense. We don’t have to put anyone’s name or phone number out on the internet,” Keith said. “It came at the best time, because now, with the trans hotline being eliminated, defunded, we’re offering this up.”
Tess Sokolis, one of the program’s co-coordinators, told the Michigan Advance in an email that she connected with Ally Moms in 2018 when her son was five years into his transition. 
“To have found those resources and to have had this community available to us when our son was starting his transition would have been an absolute godsend,” Sokolis said. 
Like many other ally parents in the program, Sokolis said her family faced several hurdles: working to find healthcare for her son after their family doctor refused to care for him; becoming estranged from family members; updating his name and gender on documents and accounts and seeking out colleges that not only offered gender affirming care, but also welcomed trans individuals. 
“We did all of this blindly and by the seats of our pants, but we did it,” Sokolis said.

Alongside her co-coordinator, Dani Jackson, Sokolis said she was brought in to revamp the Ally Parents program amid an increasingly anti-trans political climate. 
“Our process so far has been two-fold: one, contacting every Ally Parent in our database to reconfirm their commitment to the program as we worked to move it forward; and two, creating this hotline and learning it ourselves to then train our parents with the new phone system,” Sokolis said. 
The hotline soft launched at the end of June, Sokolis said, giving them the opportunity to work out any hiccups with the program. Now, there are 30 parents on board to help accept calls, with others working administratively and more being brought on board, Sokolis said. 
“We are saddened at the loss of other national LGBTQIA+ hotlines, but we are happy to give these kids and their loved ones a safe place to land as those are phased out,” Sokolis said. 
For many trans youths, having a service like this can be life changing, Keith said, as many trans kids can feel isolated, especially when they don’t know anyone who shares their identity.

While transgender and nonbinary youth are at a significantly higher risk of suicide than their cisgender peers, research published in Transgender Health found that acceptance by at least one adult or peer significantly reduced that risk. 
For parents, they face a very different journey when their child comes out as trans, Keith said. Even if they support their child unconditionally right out of the gate, they do not know how to find resources or what the next steps are, she said. 
“It truly is life changing when we can offer up that kind of support,” Keith said. “I have a trans son who’s now an adult, but when he came out 12 years ago, we really were alone. There were no resources. And so I know what that feels like, and it is just, when you find one person you can talk to, you will remember that forever.” 
In order for someone to volunteer as an ally parent, they must be the parent of a trans person, Keith explained. They must also fill out an application and undergo a background check. 
Assuming everything goes well, those parents are then given access to training as well as monthly meetings, Keith explained. 
“If answering the phone is not your thing – because some people don’t feel comfortable with that, right – then there are other ways that they can get involved,” Keith said. 
Individuals can call or text 833-435-7798 to connect with the Ally Parents Helpline. Volunteers are available from 8 a.m. to midnight EST.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Employees at one of Washington state’s largest health agencies are bracing for layoffs due to ongoing funding challenges.
Though how many could lose their jobs and when aren’t known, the leader of the Washington Health Care Authority told workers in a Wednesday email that she “didn’t want to wait to let you know that layoffs will be part of our path forward.”
“Despite significant efforts to close our budget gap, we’ve reached a point where workforce reductions will be necessary,” wrote MaryAnne Lindeblad, the agency’s interim director who will hand the baton to a new executive this month. “These decisions are not a reflection of anyone’s performance or value; they’re driven by the size of our shortfall and the structure of our funding.”
With roughly 1,900 employees, the agency is responsible for purchasing and coordinating health care services, including behavioral health treatment, for 2.7 million residents.
It administers the state’s Medicaid program known as Apple Health and health benefits for public and school employees. As of June, more than 1.9 million Washington residents, including over 850,000 children, were enrolled in Apple Health, according to the state Health Care Authority. 
In June, Gov. Bob Ferguson hired Ryan Moran, Maryland’s deputy health secretary, to be the new Health Care Authority director. HIs first day is Aug. 18.
A Health Care Authority spokesperson did not say if Moran had been consulted on the email before Lindeblad sent it out. 
Nor did the spokesperson say if the layoffs are due to the agency receiving fewer dollars in the state budget or to the tangible threat posed by new federal rules for Medicaid funding.
“A reduction in force at HCA is deeply difficult news for employees and the communities we serve,” said Katie Pope, deputy chief communications director, in an email. “We are working to responsibly manage limited resources while continuing to meet our legal and programmatic commitments to Washington residents.”
Mike Yestramski, president of the Washington Federation of State Employees, said the union had not received formal notice of layoffs as required in collective bargaining agreements. The union represents 54,000 state government, higher education and public service workers including ones at the Health Care Authority.
“Folks are definitely concerned. They are definitely worried,” he said. “It is a combination. They wonder how long. ‘I survived this round. Will I be around for the next one?’”
What’s happening at the Health Care Authority isn’t an anomaly. State workers have lost jobs or been pressed into lower-paying positions in recent months as agencies comply with cost-cutting directives from the governor and reduced funding for some programs in the state budget.

One example is the Department of Health where layoffs totaled 44 as of June 30. Less state dollars and the loss of federal pandemic money were the reasons. Further layoffs are anticipated as a result of state and federal budget reductions, a spokesperson said.
According to the Office of Financial Management, 176 people lost their jobs in the fiscal year that ended June 30 with another 96 bumping into a different position. 
The figure could surge in the coming 12 months because lawmakers did not fund 1,385 full-time-equivalent positions in state government in the current fiscal year, according to the governor’s budget office.
“We knew there would be rounds of layoffs,” Yestramski said. 
Agency leaders seem to be trying to minimize the impacts on people, he said. In some places, positions are kept vacant and thus available for someone to bump into without bumping someone else out of their job, he said.
“But you can’t get away without some folks getting harmed,” Yestramski said.
In June, Washington’s Employment Security Department started hosting webinars to teach state workers who were laid off, facing a furlough or expecting a workforce reduction about available unemployment benefits and reemployment services.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) New Mexico United States senators introduced federal legislation Friday to expand tree nursery capacity for forest replanting and habitat restoration programs.
U.S. Sens.Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich, both Democrats, joined John Cornyn (R-Texas) to sponsor the bill. The legislation, if passed, would allow funding allocated by the 2022 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support bigger facilities for seedling nurseries at state forestry, private organizations, nonprofits and higher education institutes.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed more $1.5 billion in state and private forestry, including hundreds of millions for reforestation, but cannot be used for building physical structures to increase the nurseries.
The funding would be available for expanding public forestry development, such as the John T. Harrington Forestry Research Center in Mora County.
“In New Mexico and across the country, our forests play a vital role in every community,” Luján said in a statement. “Tragically, over the last 20 years, our country has lost tree cover at an alarming rate, disrupting our ecosystem and the critical benefits it provides. That’s why I’m leading this bipartisan legislation that addresses this shortage by allowing funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to be used to support the development of seedling nurseries and the rapid expansion of crucial seedlings nationwide.”
390 million seedlings: Mora reforestation center sets sights on restoring NM forests

New Mexico’s state forester estimated the state needs between 150 and 390 million seedlings to restore forests in burned areas. Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar will require 26 million seedlings, researchers said.
The state previously received federal funding to increase the capacity of the nursery in Mora County to eventually grow 5 million seedlings per year. Currently, the center produces just 300,000 seedlings annually.
The center, jointly operated by University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, New Mexico Highlands University and the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department would seek funds if the bill passes, officials said.
“This bill will provide New Mexico with much-needed support to develop our state nursery and increase the production of drought-tolerant tree seedlings,” said EMNRD Secretary Melanie Kenderdine in a statement. “This legislation will help us grow and plant trees that will stabilize burned watersheds and reduce damage from post-wildfire flooding.”

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After Democratic state lawmakers and advocates said they feared Gregory Washington’s job as president of George Mason University was in jeopardy as the school faces multiple federal investigations, the governing board on Friday unanimously approved a state-appropriated 1.5% salary increase for him, signaling the security of his future at the institution.
George Mason professors say governing board failed to defend president, university

Attention on Washington and GMU has grown steadily over the past several weeks, after the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice launched four investigations against the school, two of which are related to alleged racial discrimination in employment practices and another that questions the school’s DEI practices.
State leaders also called for a stop to what they characterize as the politicization of Virginia’s colleges after the University of Virginia’s president resigned weeks before the GMU investigations launched, following downward pressure from federal education officials over the school’s DEI policies. 
The board had scheduled a closed session meeting on Friday to discuss Washington’s performance and goals. He presented his state-of-the-institution report, “Navigating Rough Waters,” during Thursday’s annual President’s Conference and Friday’s business meeting. Washington is the first Black president in the school’s history.
“Regardless of how one views the events unfolding at George Mason University, today’s display of unity by the Mason community is inspiring,” Washington said in a statement. “It is a reminder of how centrally important our university is to Northern Virginia’s families and economy. For now, the community can refocus on what really matters most: in just three weeks we will welcome the incoming class of 2025, which is once again the largest, most diverse and one of the most qualified freshman classes in the history of George Mason. Fellow Patriots, you are simply the best. Let’s get back to work.”
The board, which had recently been criticized by faculty members for failing to defend Washington and George Mason as they weathered the federal scrutiny, met for over three hours in closed session with Washington. 
The 1.5% salary bonus aligns with the action proposed by the General Assembly’s budget that was signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Washington’s salary will increase to $823,452.43.
Board of Visitors Rector Charles Stimson commented on the impending investigations and public concerns before leaving the business meeting.
“We’re gonna fulfill our fiduciary duty, and at George Mason University that means everybody at the university,” Stimson said, adding that the board will “get through this” and “move onto the next level.”
 Alumni and supporters speak out 

Just ahead of Friday’s meeting, Stand With Mason, a group of alumni and GMU supporters publicly stated their opposition to removing Washington from office. Students, faculty and other supporters also stood in the drizzling rain to protest against removing Washington.
In Stand With Mason’s statement, 75% of respondents said they would be concerned about the institution’s reputation if political interference led to the president’s removal. The group surveyed 411 registered voters from Northern Virginia.
“This data could not be clearer: Northern Virginia voters want their public universities focused on education — not politics,” said Brian Drummond, former George Mason Alumni Association President, in a statement. “The Board of Visitors’ actions are not just unpopular — they are dangerously out of step with public opinion, especially as we approach the November elections.”
Jimmy Hazel, former rector on the board, said before the board’s vote on Washington’s that he wouldn’t be surprised if they voted to pause on the matter, considering the outpouring of support and potential negative impact on George Mason. Hazel was part of the search committee that ultimately found Washington.
“They’re realizing there is more at stake than they thought, than just removing somebody from their job,” Hazel said. “From a realistic point of view, the federal investigations aren’t finished yet to take action against the president while the investigations are still ongoing; that just doesn’t make sense.”

Students and faculty members also feared that Washington’s removal could eliminate more initiatives and programs the president has championed. Washington said the institution has paused or terminated 50 projects due to the federal government’s restructuring. 
Savannah Scott and Annabelle Spencer, PhD students in the history department, stood outside for around two hours before the meeting to bring awareness about what’s at stake.
“These things that we’ve seen either get surrendered to the federal government or given up entirely at other universities (are) highly possible here, and I think that’s really concerning to me and us,” Spencer said.
Scott added that Washington has remained “steadfast” in his support for university policies at the cost of upsetting others at higher levels that wish to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. She voiced her concern that Washington might be succeeded by someone who would excessively accommodate the Trump administration.
DEI has been a lightning rod between political parties dating back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when these types of programs were created to assist formerly enslaved Black Americans and give them a fairer chance at educational, financial and social success in American society. 
Public demand for corporate and institutional commitments to treat all Americans fairly emerged during the pandemic in 2020 when Washington was hired. Beginning in 2020, America faced two high-profile examples of racial injustice and unequal opportunity for people of color — the murder of Black Minnesota man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, and the Supreme Court’s recission of affirmative action policies on college campuses in 2023.

Republicans argue that DEI initiatives present cultural, ideological and political problems. Chief among the concerns is the threat of placing a person’s identity over achievements when determining their qualifications, and “reverse discrimination,” which they say puts the majority, white Americans, at a disadvantage.
During the board’s hours-long review of Washington’s performance, students and faculty members also raised signs and chanted in support of Washington and in opposition to any overreach by Trump and Youngkin, who is responsible for appointing members to the governing board.
On Tuesday, a circuit court judge temporarily suspended four members from serving on GMU’s board after the Virginia Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected the appointees, signaling that the legislature wasn’t willing to confirm the new additions. An additional four were suspended at the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute. The case is expected to continue with appeals from Youngkin’s administration.
Tehama Lopez, a faculty member at George Mason, said on Friday she’s been following the investigations in Virginia including one that led to the departure of former UVA President Jim Ryan. Lopez said it hit home for her as a UVA graduate.
“It’s devastating to see what’s happened,” Lopez said. “I wish that President Ryan had not stepped down. I’m sympathetic to what he did, but I believe we need to stand firm and not acquiesce.”
 How Washington made the case for staying

On Thursday, Washington spoke publicly to the senior leadership at George Mason, presenting the institution’s current state highlighted by the school retiring $100 million in debt and earning the designation “higher access, higher earnings” for its top-rated admissions access for Pell Grant recipients and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and the number of students receiving high earnings eight years after graduation. 
The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, which assigns the ratings, manages the measurement tool to recognize and describe institutional diversity.
“We’re fulfilling the mission that I believe the individuals who founded this institution had in mind, to have an institution that was going to produce a workforce that could fund their needs and their growth,” Washington said on Thursday. “That mission is being fulfilled here, and we’re reaching people wherever you are. … We don’t care if you’re Black, white, Asian, or other. We put systems in place to support you no matter where you are, and it gets you to the point where you want to be. That’s why students are flocking here because they actually know it.”
Stimson said Thursday that the institution has worked hard to build its successful reputation, and parents considering universities should choose Mason if they want their children to succeed without significant debt.

“Mason isn’t going anywhere,” Stimson said on Thursday. “We are the best university for the best value, for the best outcomes in Virginia, in the DMV.”
Washington also talked about the school’s challenges including multiple investigations by Trump‘s administration and the federal government’s restructuring, which has cut funds for research and financial aid, economic challenges that are projected to result in job, wage, and output losses and enrollment challenges, with some non-U.S. born students prohibited from receiving visas to attend school.
The U.S. House Committee on Judiciary is also investigating Mason for potentially violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and President Donald Trump’s executive order for institutions to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to a July 29 letter.
Despite the challenges, Washington said Mason is one of the most efficient institutions in reducing the cost of attendance and graduating a significant portion of Virginia’s workforce.
Washington also presented details on the institution’s fundraising efforts and programs to support students who had dreamed of working for the federal government, as well as displaced federal workers amid the significant workforce changes.
“Why would we do this? Because we are an integral part of the region,” Washington said. “We want the region to be successful, we care about the region and we need it to be successful if we are going to be successful.”

(Photo by Vanesa Brashier/Bluebonnetnews.com)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and 16 states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published this week by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Immigration drives nation’s population growth

Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

Frank of the National Park Service | Public domain via Flickr). The state of Montana has reached an agreement with an exclusive golf club for water usage, after the club was found to be illegally diverting water for its course and trucking in water from nearby communities.
The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation reached an agreement late last month with how Crazy Mountain Ranch was using water. 
The state filed suit against Crazy Mountain Ranch, a Delaware corporation that owns 18,000 acres near Big Timber, in mid-July over an irrigation system it was using for its golf course. The company is a subsidiary of the Yellowstone Club’s parent organization, CrossHarbor Capital Partners. The resort did not have the proper water rights to divert from Rock Creek for irrigation of its golf course.
The agreement, called a “consent decree,” avoided a court battle.
“(This is)  a litigation tool for judicial enforcement signed by the district court judge and used to remedy the violation and ensure future compliance,” Patricia Spencer, a spokesperson in the DNRC’s water division wrote in an email. “The decree requires CMR to stop illegally using water on its golf course.  If CMR purchases water to irrigate, it is required to report the source of the water purchased to DNRC to ensure it complies with the Water Use Act. CMR must also continue to pursue a new permit or change authorization.”
Crazy Mountain Ranch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“(The ranch) does not have a valid water right that authorizes beneficial use of water for irrigation on the 112 acres of the proposed golf course,” the suit alleged.
In May, court documents said the company told local water users, “the ranch intended to irrigate the golf course regardless of department authorization.” The DNRC then got 12 complaints between its field offices in Bozeman and Helena.
On June 17, water users on Rock Creek and Hammond Creek submitted a “Petition to Enforce Water Court Decree and Appoint Water Commissioner” to the Park County District Court. 
An official with the DNRC was dispatched to investigate the complaints and issued a report in early July. A lawsuit was then filed.
Crazy Mountain Ranch has a permit in process for changes in water usage, court documents stated. 
While the dispute was going, the Livingston Enterprise reported the company was buying 80,000 to 100,000 gallons per day from the city.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/49945863331_bcd4562ef1_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 16:56:28.844556

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The overdue assessment of the operations and finances of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is complete and confirms what advocates and agency administrators have been saying for months: There’s no way to save costs without cutting service.
The 119-page report released Friday morning deems RIPTA “an essential service for the region” with a fixed-route service that performs well, especially within urban corridors.
But what can RIPTA do about its $10 million budget shortfall?
“Given the size of the projected operating deficit for FY 2026, RIPTA will likely need to make reductions to fixed-route service,” the report states. 
A sweeping number of cuts are proposed — with plans to eliminate or reduce 58 of RIPTA’s 67 routes — the largest service reduction in the agency’s 59-year history. The agency’s board of directors is scheduled to vote on the cuts on Thursday, Aug. 7, after the last two of 12 public hearings wrap up in Barrington on Wednesday, Aug. 6.
Should the agency’s board of directors move forward with the recommendations, cuts would take effect Sept. 13.
 
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority‘s public hearings on proposed service reductions and a possible bus fare increase in 2027 continue Monday, Aug. 4, with two sessions at the Providence Foundation, from noon to 1:30 p.m and from 5-6:30 p.m.
The final two hearings will be held Wednesday, Aug. 6, at the Barrington Public Library from noon to 1:30 p.m and from 5-6:30 p.m. 
You can submit comments through Aug. 6 by emailing marketing@ripta.com or (401) 784-9500 x1101.


The efficiency study was requested to be completed by March 1 by Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly as a condition in last year’s state budget as a condition to plug a $15 million deficit. But the agency’s board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
WSP was paid $412,346 to complete the report.
RIPTA released three draft sections in the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session in order to inform the state’s final budget, which ultimately left RIPTA with a $17.6 million gap to fill.
The deficit was originally $32.6 million when McKee unveiled his recommended fiscal 2026 budget in January, but lawmakers eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account. 
RIPTA administrators managed to reduce the shortfall to $10 million, thanks to what RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand called a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. 
WSP’s report does provide a few recommendations: try to secure more ads, upping third party service contracts, and in one case, the sale of station naming rights. But those ideas are meant to be implemented over the course of several years.
With the multimillion dollar gap left by state leaders, the study’s primary suggestion is to slash service — primarily to low-scoring routes.
Those routes in the report include the 88 bus, which travels in the morning and afternoon from Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
All of them are slated for elimination under RIPTA’s proposed service changes.
But even the report stated that low-scoring routes may still serve important functions by connecting specific transit-oriented populations to essential goods and services 
“In such cases, maintaining the current service may be warranted despite lower performance metrics,” the report states.
Instead, WSP suggests folding the lower-performing routes with the more popular ones or converting them into “microtransit zones” that feed into the larger fixed-route system.

Bus fare has remained $2 for 15 years
The report also floats the idea of bumping up RIPTA’s $2 single ride fare, which has been in place since 2010. WSP suggests increasing trip costs could generate around $1 million to $2 million annually. 
But the report states a price hike could discourage some riders from continuing to use transit, “such that it diminishes the total revenue increase that would have occurred if all riders continued using transit.” 
“Some estimates suggest travel demand reduces by roughly half the fare increase, such that a 10% fare increase would result in [a] 5% decrease in travel demand,” according to the report. It cited a 2021 study that found riders in Stockholm County in Sweden who took longer trips or had higher incomes were more likely to stop riding after fares increased in 2017, while metro users were  least affected.
Agency leaders have previously said they want to conduct an analysis of the impacts of a potential fare increase on “ridership, revenue, and equity.” Fare increases may be considered for 2027, according to the presentation RIPTA is giving at its public hearings on proposed service changes.
RIPTA and its board of directors are in the process of reviewing the suggestions and incorporating them into the agency’s daily operations, agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in a statement.
The Save RIPTA campaign, an offshoot of the Providence Streets Coalition, saw no surprises in the report in a statement Friday afternoon.
“The study told us exactly what we’ve known all along: that RIPTA runs efficiently compared to similar sized agencies, and that there is no way to prevent catastrophic cuts to service,” the coalition wrote. “There is no hidden money in any couch cushions, that will prevent tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders from losing access to employment, education, economic mobility, medical services, and more,” the campaign wrote in a statement.
The Providence Streets Coalition launched the Save RIPTA campaign in 2023 to lobby state leaders to fully fund the agency in the face of looming budget deficits caused by federal pandemic aid drying up.
And with proposed cuts now up for consideration, the campaign is looking to get riders to push McKee and other state leaders to shift any funding that can keep the agency’s existing service afloat.
“$10 million out of a $14 billion budget is so minimal compared to the harm and economic consequences of these cuts,” the campaign wrote.
But McKee has stood firm against flexing any state funds, pointing to the efficiency study as a way to find savings. Spokesperson Olivia DaRocha said Friday the full study “identifies both efficiencies and revenue enhancements to close RIPTA’s remaining deficit responsibly.”
“Combined, these strategies provide RIPTA with viable options to balance the budget without making service reductions to higher-performing routes,” DaRocha said in an emailed statement.










Given the size of the projected operating deficit for FY 2026, RIPTA will likely need to make reductions to fixed-route service.


– Rhode Island Public Transit Authority Operational Efficiency Study Final Report July 31st, 2025


In a joint statement, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said they were in the midst of reviewing the final efficiency study.
“Our state needs a strong and sustainable public transit system, because it is so important for the health of our economy and for the quality of life of thousands of Rhode Islanders,” they said. “We will continue working with RIPTA’s leadership, and all our partners, to help RIPTA meet the needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Political leaders are already putting pressure on the state to halt RIPTA’s proposed cuts.
Less service will mean more cars on the road and fewer available parking spaces, Democratic Rep. Teresa Tanzi said Wednesday at a public hearing in South Kingstown where she lives.
“The efficiency that we’re going to lose if these cuts do in fact go through is exponential,” she said. “We won’t be able to recover from this overnight.”
In a joint statement Thursday, Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien and the city’s General Assembly delegation said the proposed cuts “will have devastating consequences for our most vulnerable citizens.”
“It is unfair for the working class to shoulder the burden of budget shortfalls,” Pawtucket leaders said. “Our community members deserve the same inalienable rights provided to all members of society, regardless of class, to provide for themselves and their families, and for many, public transit is their only option.”

A real estate developer is suing the City of Bondurant, alleging changes in plans for streets could cost the company millions of dollars.
Hubbell Realty Company Bondurant, also known as HRC, is suing the city in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
HRC claims that in 2021, it purchased land in the city near Highway 65 for $2.3 million. Its city-approved plans for the land allegedly preserved for future development two multifamily lots on which HRC planned to build apartments. The preliminary plat specified the location of roadways and was allegedly approved by the Bondurant City Council.

In August 2022, HRC began construction on the development, including the construction of roadways as previously approved by the city. At some point later that summer, the lawsuit claims, city officials decided the planned 16th Street NE should be relocated in such a way as to run through the center of the land where the HRC planned to build the Featherstone Apartments.
As a result, the lawsuit alleges, “HRC will be forced to redesign the subdivision, and HRC will lose millions of dollars. Put another way, had HRC been made aware of the modified roadway in 2021, then it would have structured the entire development in a different way.”
The company claims the modification to the roadway plans also creates a safety risk.
“Imagine a residential thoroughfare running directly through an apartment complex to separate its playground, pool, or other amenities from the residences,” the lawsuit states, adding that new design moves the intersection of 16th Street NE and Highway 65 “dangerously close” to the intersection of 14th Street NE and Highway 65.
“There has been no safety review by the Department of Transportation or anyone else to compare the safety of the proposed intersections contained in the preliminary plat versus the safety of the new concept approved in July 2024,” the lawsuit claims. It alleges city officials say the reason for the change is to assist with a new commercial development that is planned for the other side of Highway 65 in 2028.
HRC argues that the total loss of acreage from the planned changes, and the resulting increase in costs, is the “equivalent to a loss of nearly $2 million to HRC.” The company is seeking a court judgment finding that the Bondurant City Council’s actions constitute violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The Republican National Committee and the Montana Republican Party last week filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit challenging two “commonsense” election laws passed during the 2025 Legislature.
The Montana Federation of Public Employees filed a suit in May before Lewis and Clark County District Court, challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 490, which changed voter registration opportunities, and Senate Bill 276, which strengthened voter ID laws.
The Republican groups’ brief in support of the motion to intervene said the lawsuit would “impact the Republican Party’s distinct interests in an efficient and reliable 2026 election that voters trust.”
“Voter ID and accurate voter registration are essential to secure elections,” RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. “Democrat extremists are attacking Montana’s voter ID requirements and registration safeguards. The RNC and MTGOP are stepping in to protect the integrity of Montana’s elections and ensure only eligible Montana voters can cast a ballot.”
Both bills were sponsored by state Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka.
SB 490 tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on Election Day and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it on the prior Saturday, which previously was not a day voters could register.
Under previous Montana law, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations.
Last November, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot.
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill.
“The intent is to smooth out the process and avoid votes being cast many hours beyond the intended closing of the polls at 8 p.m.,” Cuffe wrote.
SB 276 enacted photo identification voting in Montana, and expands the variety of ID options allowed to include tribal photo ID cards, military IDs, U.S. Passports, driver’s licenses and student ID cards.

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Blackfeet Nation, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, as well as tribal advocacy nonprofit Western Native Voice, filed to join the lawsuit as intervenors last month, saying the Legislature was insisting on “making it more difficult for Native Americans in Montana to vote,” by restricting registration opportunities.
In the Republican groups’ brief, they cited several reasons for inclusion in the lawsuit, including that declaring the laws unconstitutional would “undermine Republican voter confidence in the electoral system and create administrative problems that could undermine Republican turnout.”
It would also force the state and federal political party to “divert resources from other mission-critical activities toward get-out-the-vote activities to reinspire Republican voter trust in Montana’s electoral system, to independently verify the accuracy of Montana’s voter registration rolls, and to educate voters and candidates concerning Montana’s changed registration requirements.”

Article Summary

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and other Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration over policies to limit gender-affirming care for youths.
The lawsuit argues the policies violate states’ 10th Amendment right to regulate health care.
Many Illinois health care providers have stopped providing gender-affirming care to comply with federal orders.
Raoul declined to say whether health care providers should continue providing gender-affirming care while a federal judge considers the lawsuit.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is joining a multi-state lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from limiting gender-affirming care.
The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts district court by 17 states, argues an executive order signed in January by President Donald Trump that directs federal agencies to take “appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving federal research and education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children” violates states’ 10th Amendment right to regulate medical care.
The order defines “children” as people under age 19, which the attorneys general say conflicts with many states such as Illinois, where people are generally considered adults when they turn 18. A separate executive order by the president established that the federal government only recognizes two genders.
It also seeks to block two Department of Justice orders that direct the DOJ to investigate and enforce legal action against doctors, hospitals and other medical professionals that provide gender-affirming care to youths.
The orders use “cruel, demeaning language” to “undermine the legitimacy” of medical care, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference Friday.
“This administration is driving a wedge between patients and health care providers from providing patients the health care that they need,” Raoul said.
Also troubling to the attorneys general is the prospect of criminal prosecution against doctors who provide care.
“The Department of Justice is diverting valuable law enforcement resources away from catching criminals and predators who are actually harming children,” Raoul said. “How does any of this keep our children or our communities safer?”
Guidance to Illinois doctors
The orders have also caused Illinois health care providers to stop providing types of gender-affirming care, including University of Chicago Medical Center, UI Health, Rush, Northwestern Medicine and Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago.
Though Raoul said he opposes the Trump administration’s policies and believes they are illegal, he declined to give legal advice about whether Illinois health care providers should continue following the federal directives while the lawsuit proceeds.
“I am not a health care administrator; I am not the head of a hospital that’s being threatened with potential criminal investigation or prosecution or removal of funding that goes toward saving the lives of various patients,” Raoul said. “And so I am not in the position of either advising what administrative decisions should be made at hospitals.”
Raoul said his role is to “remove” legal threats against the state and its residents.
Medical providers that decide to stop providing gender-affirming care are likely not guilty of discrimination under Illinois law, Raoul said, “particularly if the federal government is threatening you with criminal prosecution.” He added Illinois laws don’t require doctors to provide a full range of gender-affirming care.
Illinois has numerous laws on the books establishing legal gender-affirming care, including protections for Illinois health care providers from prosecution and other disciplinary action in other states for giving legal health care to patients in Illinois that might be considered illegal in another state.

(Photo: NPS / Jacob W. Frank)In a 1968 speech made while signing a series of conservation bills, President Lyndon B. Johnson expounded on the wonders of a free-flowing river. 
“An unspoiled river is a very rare thing in this nation today,” he said. “Their flow and vitality have been harnessed by dams and too often they have been turned into open sewers by communities and by industries. It makes us all very fearful that all rivers will go this way unless somebody acts now to try to balance our river development.”
Johnson signed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to protect free-flowing waterways with “extraordinary natural, cultural and recreational qualities.”
The original National Wild and Scenic Rivers system comprised eight rivers and included more than two dozen more to study for future protections, including Montana’s Flathead River.
Just eight years later, Congress amended the act to include the three forks of the Flathead River, and a stretch of the Missouri River. 
Today, more than 13,467 miles of 228 rivers are protected by the national system, but according to the Department of the Interior, this represents less than one half of one percent of the nation’s rivers.
Montana’s western Rep. Ryan Zinke hopes to bolster Montana’s wild and scenic river mileage by roughly 25%.
At a press conference in Bozeman on Tuesday, Zinke announced new legislation to designate an additional nearly 100 miles of river in Madison and Gallatin counties as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
“Striking the right balance between conservation and multiple use of our resources is the Montana way. These rivers support everything from family farms to fly shops, ranchers to rafters, and literally power our community,” Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Trump’s first term, said in a press statement. “Madison and Gallatin Counties both rely on these waters for irrigation and energy, but also for the outdoor recreation economy that fuels small businesses and draws visitors from around the world. This bill strikes the right balance between preserving what we treasure, maintaining access for recreation, and ensuring continued operation of the existing dams on the river.”
The Greater Yellowstone Recreation Enhancement and Tourism Act would add protections to 98 miles of the Madison River and Gallatin River. 
The designations include:

42 miles of the Madison River, from the Cabin Creek confluence to Cherry Gulch 
39.6 miles of the Gallatin River, from the Yellowstone National Park boundary to Spanish Creek 
4.6 miles of Hyalite Creek, from its headwaters to Grotto Falls Trailhead 
7.3 miles of Cabin Creek, beginning at its headwaters 
5.1 miles of the Middle Fork Cabin Creek, from its headwaters to its confluence with Cabin Creek

Support for protecting these stretches of river comes from multiple conservation groups and both the Madison and Gallatin county commissions. Both commissions submitted letters of support to Congress.  
“This effort enjoys broad, bipartisan support across Montana—from farmers and ranchers to business owners, conservationists, sportsmen, and local governments—reflecting a shared understanding that safeguarding our rivers is not a partisan issue, but a Montana value,” said Gallatin County commissioners Scott MacFarlane, Zach Brown, and Jennifer Boyer.

Under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, rivers are classified in three types: wild, scenic and recreational. A single river, or river segment, may be given multiple classifications depending on the level of development along the river at the time of designation. 
For federally administered rivers, the designated corridor generally averages a quarter mile on either side for waterways in the contiguous U.S., in order to protect river-related values. 
The last, and only, additional Montana river to receive such protections was East Rosebud Creek in 2018. The legislation for East Rosebud Creek was sponsored by Sen. Steve Daines and then Sen. Jon Tester, as well as the state’s only representative at the time, then-Rep. Greg Gianforte.
Tester had also sought to pass the Montana Headwaters Legacy Act which would have added 19 rivers and 327 river miles in the Missouri and Yellowstone River systems to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. That bill was put on the legislative calendar in November 2024, but never received a formal vote or was included in a larger legislative package. 
In a committee markup, Sen. Daines voted against the Headwaters Act, which included the sections of the Madison and Gallatin rivers in Zinke’s new legislation.
While the Greater Yellowstone bill contains a more targeted section of Montana waterways to pass, many conservation groups that pushed for added protections over the years cheered the announcement as a step forward. 
“From fishing for world-class trout and rafting through rapids to hunting river bottom whitetails and migrating ducks and geese, the Madison and Gallatin Rivers are a hunter’s and angler’s dream,” Ryan Chapin, Montana field manager for the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership said in a statement, “These waters breathe lifeblood into southwest Montana, and this proposed legislation will benefit more than sportsmen. Ranchers, farmers, and local businesses depend on the health of these watersheds to thrive.”
Charles Drimal, director of conservation at the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, wrote in a blog post that the legislation builds on “years of community conversations, scientific study, and broad coalition input led by GYC and our partners.”
“Protecting these rivers means sustaining outdoor recreation economies built on tourism, fishing, and floating; securing clean, reliable water for communities, agriculture, and ecosystems; protecting wildlife habitat and biodiversity along rivers; and preserving the character of Montana’s communities and landscapes,” Drimal wrote.
Zinke’s bill also drew statements of support from the American Rivers Action Fund, the Gallatin River Task Force and American Whitewater.

President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans have criticized NPR and PBS of left-leaning bias, an accusation the public media organizations have rejected.“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement Friday.“CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care,” Harrison said.She added that “public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country.”CPB said employees were notified Friday that the majority of staff positions “will conclude with the close of the fiscal year on September 30, 2025,” and a small transition team will stay through January 2026.The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education spending bill for fiscal year 2026, which did not include any CPB funding.Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the panel, expressed her disappointment over the lack of a CPB allocation in the bill during a committee markup. “It is a shameful reality and now communities across the country will suffer the consequences as over 1,500 stations lose critical funding,” Murray said.In a win for the Trump administration, Congress passed a rescissions package in July that clawed back $9 billion in previously approved spending for public broadcasting and foreign aid, including $1.1 billion for CPB.Trump signed the measure into law just days later.",,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

The federal government has determined the potential multibillion-dollar investment to construct the proposed Baltimore-Washington Superconducting Magnetic Levitation (SCMAGLEV), known as maglev, “is no longer feasible,” according to the Federal Railroad Administration.
An upcoming notice in the Federal Register, scheduled to be published Monday, highlights a few of the federal properties along the route between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore that would be affected, such as Fort George G. Meade in Anne Arundel County.
“Following extensive consultation with these agencies, the railroad administration determined the direct effects would have substantial negative effects to agency operations or to important resources managed by federal agencies,” according to the notice. “In addition, indirect effects would also significantly impair critical infrastructure and operations and ongoing agency missions.”
However, the decision does not preclude future deployment of the SCMAGLEV technology in the U.S., according to the notice.
The U.S. Department of Transportation has estimated the capital cost to build the project at nearly $20 billion.
“We want big, beautiful projects worthy of taxpayer dollars — including high-speed rail,” U.S. DOT Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a statement Friday. “This project lacked everything needed to be a success from planning to execution. This project did not have the means to go the distance, and I can’t in good conscience keep taxpayers on the hook for it.”
Some Prince George’s County residents such as Susan McCutchen were ecstatic with the decision.
“It’s a huge deal and it feels a bit overwhelming, almost to the point that you can’t quite believe it,” she said Friday. “We’re optimistic, but we’re keeping an eye out still.”
That cautious optimism surfaced late Thursday night after a letter was circulated from Drew Feeley, acting administrator for the Federal Railroad Administration.
Feeley’s letter sent to Maryland Department of Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld, who’s scheduled to leave the position Friday, summarizes that the administration will rescind a notice of intent to not prepare an environmental impact statement.
“Since the award was obligated in 2016, the environmental review process has been paused twice on the Federal Permitting Dashboard. It remains on pause today, where it has been since August 24, 2021,” Feeley wrote Thursday. “Given the substantial delay and cost overruns associated with the Project, FRA does not see a viable path to continue investment in the Project.”
Wiedefeld responded in a letter Thursday that the state will comply with the administration’s request to submit final reports to terminate and close out a cooperative agreement on the project. The railroad administration first awarded the state Department of Transportation $27 million in 2016 for preliminary engineering and environmental review.
“MDOT understands that FRA’s decision reflects the significant challenges posed by the project, including substantial impacts to federal agencies and federal properties,” he wrote. “MDOT appreciates FRA’s partnership in advancing rail infrastructure and safety improvements in the State of Maryland.”
One major supporter of the project was Gov. Wes Moore (D), who watched a high-speed maglev train in April during a trade mission to Japan.
Moore spokesperson Carter Elliott said in a statement: “In order for this to be Maryland’s decade we must continue to investigate innovative technologies that better connect people from where they live to where they work. Although this project had challenges that were insurmountable, we look forward to working with FRA to advance transportation solutions that improve the safety, reliability, and efficacy of our transportation system.”
Baltimore Washington Rapid Rail is the company that was slated to develop the project labeled Northeast Maglev. The train was proposed to connect between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore in 15 minutes at a speed of 311 mile per hour; and a trip between Washington and New York in an hour.
The company said in a statement Friday afternoon the administration’s decision represents a “missed opportunity.”
“The SCMAGLEV would have resulted in over $6 billion in private investment, created more than 160,000 jobs, and replaced 16 million car trips,” the company said. “With cars being the largest source of pollution in Maryland, significant air quality benefits would have been realized. Instead, the Washington, DC metro area will remain number one in the country for the worst traffic, delays, and congestion.”
Besides the company highlighting private investments of nearly $158 million, Northeast Maglev received representation from two of the state’s biggest lobbying firms: Evans and Associates and Manis Canning and Associates, both based in Annapolis.
However, several state lawmakers have expressed displeasure with the project.
In 2023, Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s) and state Sens. Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) and Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) and former state Sen. Paul Pinsky (D-Prince George’s) sponsored legislation that would prohibit state funds from being used toward the maglev project. The legislation didn’t advance out of the respective committees.
Before Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s) was elected to the House of Delegates, he opposed the project back in 2017.
“This result is a culmination of years of advocacy,” Martinez said Friday. “To be here in 2025 and finally have a decision that speaks to what we’ve said the from start, and that this particular project for this particular community doesn’t work from the environmental impacts to the lack of economic development to the impacts of people’s homes. I’m just really appreciative that we can now put this train to bed.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/day1_067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State and labor officials unveiled diverging proposals to cut costs for New Jersey’s distressed state worker health plan by $200 million each calendar year.
Proposals from Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration focus mainly on reducing health plans’ share of medical costs, while union proposals lean mostly on controlling the cost of medical services, whether through caps that would tie rates to Medicare and Medicaid or expanded billing reviews.
Language in this year’s state budget requires both sides to identify potential savings for the State Health Benefits Program, and allows the state’s plan design committee — which sets plan coverage rules — to select which savings options to pursue. The state’s actuaries must agree that the changes will reduce costs by at least $100 million in the first six months of 2026.
But apart from proposals that would tie prescriptions of certain weight-loss drugs to participation in lifestyle management or anti-obesity counseling programs and allow more procedures at center of excellence facilities — a pilot program caps prices there — the two sides’ plans have little in common.
Billy Gallagher, assistant to the vice president of Communications Workers of America District 1, called the state’s proposals “outrageous and unacceptable.” The CWA is the largest union of state workers.
“For years, this administration, like the administration before it, has made cuts on our members’ backs and asked the very workers who keep this state open and running to sacrifice, to cut back more and more,” Gallagher said.
State officials, meanwhile, say their proposals could achieve “significantly” more savings than the $100 million target for the first half of next year.
“These plan design proposals will maintain the SHBP members’ access to high-quality, affordable health care, while incentivizing more cost-effective health care decisions by members and bolstering the sustainability of the SHBP now and for years to come,” state officials said in a letter attached to their plan.

New Jersey’s public worker health plans are in trouble after years of escalating premiums driven by broad use of expensive weight-loss drugs, growing utilization of high-cost services, and inflation.
The two sides’ proposals seek cost savings within state workers’ part of the plan, which is insulated from some of the dynamics that Treasury officials say have put local government workers’ public plan into an actuarial death spiral. Escalating costs on the local plan have pushed out more and more towns to private options, driving premiums yet higher.
The state’s proposals include multiple options that would eliminate existing plans within the State Health Benefit Program and replace them with ones that make workers responsible for a greater share of their health care expenses.
State plans under the program carry actuarial values — the share of medical spending paid for by the health plan instead of workers — of between 93% and 98%, according to a Treasury report released in May. The state’s proposals include plans with actuarial values between 88% and 94.5% (a 2023 comparison of plan designs conducted by the state’s actuaries found comparable large public employee health plans in the mid-Atlantic region had actuarial values between 93.6% and 96.9%).
The state’s proposed plans typically feature higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums compared to existing plans. In many cases, these plans also include higher copays across a range of services, though some are at or below levels offered under some existing plans. 
Some of the state’s options recommend sunsetting certain high-cost plans to drive workers to extant plans with lower costs for the state.
Other proposals include keeping existing plans and raising all deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums by $1,000, limiting or ending coverage for weight-loss drugs in most circumstances, capping annual chiropractic and physical therapy visits, and imposing a $50 monthly surcharge on subscribers whose spouses could get health care through their employer.
There’s little indication that union officials will support those proposals.

The unions’ cost savings proposals mostly aim at reducing medical expenses. They urge officials to review at least 50% of state claims each year to spot payment errors that can be clawed back by the state.
They said the state should bar medical providers from billing workers for costs not reimbursed by their health plan and cap reimbursements to 200% of the rates set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a practice called reference-based pricing.
It’s not clear whether the state’s actuaries will accept that recommendation. Administration members on New Jersey’s plan design committees who have previously voted down reference-based pricing proposals have said the bodies lack the authority to enact the practice. 
Labor proposals include a recommendation that New Jersey negotiate its own drug prices rather than contracting out to a third party and audit prices for the 100 most-billed drugs, arguing prescription drug discounts have been too slow to reach the state.
They also said the state should offer incentives for workers to voluntarily join plans with higher deductibles.
“There are solutions here, but our elected leaders must be willing to act. There are over 400,000 voters covered by the State Health Benefits Plan and health care is going to be a major concern as they submit their ballots or head to the ballot box this fall. We cannot afford continued stalling and delaying here,” Gallagher said.
Murphy, who is in the closing months of his second term, cannot seek a third term in November. Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are vying to succeed him.
The differences between proposals — and the plan design committee’s even split between administration and labor members — could create a deadlocked panel. If they’re still deadlocked by Sept. 30, budget language requires them to enter mediation under a super conciliator to bridge the impasse.
If the conciliator does not push the board to a resolution by Oct. 31, budget language requires the Legislature to pass a bill to secure the savings by Dec. 1. If no bill is passed, negotiations would relaunch between single representatives of the two sides. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services would appoint a tiebreaker if no agreement is reached by Dec. 15.

Kevin Stitt speaks at his weekly media availability on May 28, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s governor this week directed all state agencies to cease providing public funding to individuals or organizations “affiliated with abortion providers.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt said he ordered the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to terminate and refuse to renew any Medicaid contracts to doctors or entities that “performs, refers for, or is affiliated with the performance of abortions not permitted under state law.” He said the agency must also implement enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance and require Medicaid providers to sign a document attesting to whether they’re connected to anyone providing “abortion-related activities.” 
He said only providers who are “fully aligned with Oklahoma’s public policy objectives, including the protection of unborn life” will be eligible to participate in Medicaid, which is funded jointly by state and federal money.
“We won’t allow tax dollars to indirectly subsidize and flow into the abortion industry under the guise of women’s health,” he said in a statement. “My order makes sure every public dollar aligns with our values and supports providers who respect life at every stage.”
Stitt said his executive order follows a June U.S. Supreme Court decision affirming that states can determine who takes part in their Medicaid programs. That includes the right to ban any affiliated individuals or organizations with ties to abortion providers, he said. 
Oklahoma currently has no licensed abortion providers. State law bars all abortions except to save the life of the mother.
An Oklahoma Health Care Authority spokesperson did not know Friday how many providers were expected to be impacted by the order. She wrote in an email that the agency was still analyzing the impact on provider counts and the order “to determine next steps as we ensure compliance and maintain services for our members.”
Nearly 1 in 4 Oklahomans are enrolled in Medicaid, also known as SoonerCare.
Under Stitt’s order, the Health Care Authority must implement the revised standards within 120 days and report back to Stitt’s office on the number of impacted providers.

Gov. Dan McKee and the Rhode Island Office of Healthy Aging announced a two-month special enrollment period for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage patients on Thursday — exactly one month after the health insurer’s existing contract with Brown University Health ended. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined the insurance change period was needed after reviewing UnitedHealthcare’s notice of the soon-to-cease contract, submitted in May before coverage ended.
The health system and the health insurer failed to negotiate a new agreement due to disputes over reimbursement rates — a point of contention between insurance companies and providers nationwide. This, in turn, meant thousands of Rhode Islanders were suddenly considered “out of network” for most treatments and physician visits at Rhode Island Hospital, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Newport Hospital. 
Medicare contract talks between Brown Health and United are over. Uncertainty is just beginning.

Mailers and online information pages sought to alert affected patients ahead of the July 1 termination date for coverage. But conflicting narratives about when coverage ended left some plan participants surprised to find their surgeries suddenly canceled, according to news reports. Losing insurance coverage could also force affected patients to pay more for the same treatments.
“This is important news for seniors in Rhode Island whose coverage was disrupted earlier this month,” McKee said in a statement Thursday. “Without this special election period, every impacted individual had to submit an individual waiver request to change carriers—with no guarantee that they would be granted. Our team at the Office of Healthy Aging stands ready to assist impacted Rhode Islanders.”
UnitedHealthcare and Brown University Health each did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday.
The special enrollment period was triggered by United’s notice to federal regulators of the end to its contract with Brown University Health. The Rhode Island Office of Healthy Aging and the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General also submitted letters to CMS asking for a special window for plan participants to change insurance plans or carriers.
“We were primarily concerned about the impact on our senior population,” Steven Boudreau, a spokesperson for the Office of Healthy Aging, said in an interview Friday.

Federally reported data estimates 129,000 Rhode Islanders are enrolled in Medicare Advantage health insurance plans available for people 65 and older, or with disabilities or chronic conditions like end-stage kidney failure or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.) The commercial alternative to government-run traditional Medicare has grown in popularity nationwide and in Rhode Island with the promise of additional benefits and cost savings to participants. Participation in United’s Medicare Advantage program in Rhode Island grew 10.1%, to 37,000 plan participants, in 2023, according to the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner’s (OHIC) 2025 annual report.
However, private providers have faced backlash for inflating testing and diagnostics as a means to increase their bottom lines. 
Complaints are ‘very few’
The Office of Healthy Aging continues to field inquiries — though “very few” complaints — from affected plan participants, Boudreau said.
“We certainly prepared ourselves for a heck of a lot more,” he said.
The most common question Boudreau’s office has gotten: “What are my options?” 
The Attorney General’s office also continues to receive consumer questions, Timothy Rondeau, an office spokesperson, said in a text. The AG has updated its webpage about the insurance coverage change to include information about the new special enrollment period.
Once UnitedHealth mails notices to affected patients, they have 60 days to switch to a different Medicare Advantage plan, or return to government-run Medicare. Other commercial insurers that offer Medicare Advantage in all or parts of Rhode Island include Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, Aetna, Humana, WellCare, and Cigna.
Terms of the special enrollment period are set by CMS, including a one-month delay between when coverage ended and the new enrollment begins to give affected enrollees enough time to make informed decisions about changing their coverage, Boudreau said.
Eligible individuals can get help deciding which insurance option is right for them by contacting the State Health Insurance Assistance Program hotline at 1-888-884-8721.
The regular open enrollment period for changing health insurance runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.
The end to the contract between Brown University Health and United did not affect dual Medicare and Medicaid recipients, nor did it affect coverage at Brown University Health’s Massachusetts hospitals. There are also assurances for continuity of care in certain cases, including patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed cancer, or those in active cancer treatment. United Medicare Advantage plan participants whose insurance is covered through a former employer under a group plan may also continue to receive care at Brown University Health hospitals.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)While legal battles  over federal funding to Planned Parenthood after Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in early July have paused efforts to defund the organization, three Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia had already lost Title X family planning funding this past April, forcing thousands to pay more for reproductive health care, or lose access to it altogether. 
“That funding is still frozen sadly,” said Virginia League for Planned Parenthood CEO Paulette McElwain. 
Established in 1970, the federal program helps low and extremely low-income people access family planning care like contraception, sexually transmitted disease screenings and treatment as well as cancer screenings at little or no cost. 
McElwain said this past spring that clinics became aware of a freeze on Title X funding by President Donald Trump’s administration on March 31, which means that about 11,000 Virginian patients have had to pay higher costs for services or forgo them since then. 
Affected health centers are in Richmond, Hampton, and Virginia Beach. 
The initial freeze to the grants stemmed from the Trump administration’s crackdown on organizations that include Diversity, Equity and Inclusion practices in their work or mission statements. The pause affected nine Planned Parenthood grantees and seven nonprofit grantees that included clinics, health departments and federally qualified health centers. 
While Title X grants have been restored to some recipients, like a health nonprofit that disburses the funding to clinics in Missouri, that hasn’t been the case for Virginia’s Planned Parenthood clinics. 
Planned Parenthood clinics provide a variety of reproductive health care, but their name has become synonymous mainly with the abortion procedures it also provides and drawn ire from abortion opponents. 
The freeze wasn’t the first time Trump has used the family planning funding to also crack down on abortion providers. Regulations during his first term disqualified clinics from receiving Title X funds that had co-located abortion services or who provided abortion referrals. President Joe Biden’s subsequent administration reversed those actions. 
Planned Parenthood continues to exist under a microscope of scrutiny by the Trump administration and Republican members of Congress, whose reconciliation bill this summer seeks to defund the organization by restricting Medicaid reimbursements. Though the organization is not specifically named in the bill, its leaders claim it was meant to affect their nearly 600 centers across 48 states. A federal judge recently blocked the effort for the time being.  
Likewise, a lawsuit is in progress concerning the Title X funding freeze that hit some clinics this spring. Filed in the District Court of Columbia, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union suit argues that about 842,000 people across the affected states faced reduced access to care.

(Photo by Marisa Demarco / KUNM)Operating hours at New Mexico’s busiest courthouse remained limited on Thursday because of what state judicial officials say is a potentially dangerous decision by the local sheriff’s office to limit how many deputies work security there.
The dispute over security staffing at the Bernalillo County Courthouse comes as judges and court administrators are telling lawmakers they feel unsafe doing their jobs across the state.
The interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee invited county and state court officials to meet with them July 31, a week after the New Mexico Supreme Court limited how many people can enter three court buildings in downtown Albuquerque. Court officials described the operational change as a precautionary safety measure in response to Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office staffing reductions, a characterization the sheriff’s office disputes.
On Thursday, Second Judicial District Court Chief Judge Marie Ward told the committee the number of Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputies working security at the courthouse started to decrease in January, and by July 10 stood at roughly half of what it was normally. The sheriff’s office, in a news release, has said it restructured staffing “to identify inefficiencies” and “achieve the same level of security and service with fewer deputies.”
The situation remained unresolved on Thursday, despite ongoing negotiations between Ward, Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen, County Manager Cindy Chavez and county commissioners.
The Administrative Office of the Courts last month pointed to examples of violent threats against judges and court staff across the state as reasons for state lawmakers to consider allocating more funding for court security and creating an internal security force for the courts rather than relying on local police.
NM judiciary suggests lawmakers create state court marshals service

Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Peter Golden told the committee the Legislature could solve court staffing problems by allowing more retired police officers to return to work as court security specialists while keeping their pensions.
New Mexico last year allowed police who retired by the end of 2024 and who haven’t worked for at least three months to return to certain public safety jobs. However, Golden said the new law limits his recruitment pool because it only allows retired cops to receive their pensions for three consecutive years while working, and they must be hired by the end of June 2027.
“I have individuals right now that are willing to rehire as court security specialists, but they will not forgo a continuous full-time position in retirement for one that only has a limit of 36 months,” he said.
The Legislature could consider changing the criteria, but won’t be able to for months, said Committee Vice Chair Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos). Lawmakers’ next regular session is in January; the governor is expected to call a special session later this month or in early September, but agenda items will be limited to the governor’s discretion.
A short-term solution, Golden said, would be for the Legislature to provide $1 million to pay for deputies’ overtime working court security.
Chandler called that idea a “non-starter.”
“That’s something that needs to be brought up to the county commission,” she said.

Andy Beshear speaks with reporters outside an event at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 20, 2024. (Photo by Jacob Fischler/States Newsroom)FRANKFORT, Ky. — Gov. Andy Beshear’s super PAC In This Together reported raising $618,200 during the first half of this year to the Federal Election Commission late Thursday.
The super PAC was founded soon after the governor’s reelection in 2023 and funds his ongoing political activity and aspirations as he explores a possible run for president in 2028.
In This Together is the type of political committee that can accept contributions of unlimited amounts. And it got three big ones earlier this year. The report filed with the FEC discloses:

TDA Properties of Elizabethtown contributed $100,000 on March 25. Kentucky Secretary of State records list Tim Aulbach as president of TDA Properties.
Ullico Management Co. gave $90,000 on June 2. The Washington, D.C.-based  insurance and investment company serves trade union members.
ECL Entertainment of Las Vegas, gave $75,000 on March 21. ECL Entertainment owns Kentucky Downs race track in Franklin and four gambling parlors where players bet on so-called “historic horseracing” machines.

But the report filed with the FEC this week reveals only a part — perhaps only half, or less — of the details of In This Together’s financial condition because the PAC also reports part of its contributions and expenses to the Internal Revenue Service. The report it must file with the IRS is not due until later this month.
While no final conclusions about the super PAC’s fundraising and spending can be drawn until that disclosure with the IRS is posted, nearly all of the spending listed in the report filed Thursday with the FEC went for operating expenses.
The report lists only one disbursement that follows the purported purpose of the super PAC, which is to help political candidates and causes that share Beshear’s political beliefs and goals. That was a $2,200 contribution to the political committee of Michael Mueller, the Franklin County judge executive.
The largest expenses by far were paid to GPS Impact, of Des Moines, Iowa. They totaled $129,000 and paid for list acquisition, digital consulting and digital ads.
Other big expenses were: $43,800 to Outperform Strategies, the Louisville political consulting firm headed by Beshear’s longtime political strategist Eric Hyers; $30,000 to Elias Law of Washington, D.C., for legal services; $25,000 to the fundraising consulting firm headed by Beshear’s longtime fundraiser Lucas Johnson; $18,000 to Public Policy Polling of Raleigh, North Carolina; $17,500 to CFO Compliance of Providence Rhode Island, for compliance consulting; $15,000 to Capital Strategies of Marina Del Rey, California, for strategic consulting; and $12,000 to Lauren Hitt of Washington DC, for communications consulting.
in a response to emailed questions from Kentucky Lantern, Hyers suggested the pending report to be filed with the IRS will list much more direct spending by In This Together to help  Beshear-supported candidates, including a “six figure” expense for targeted mail that helped Susan Crawford win election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the spring.
Big donors during the period other than the three listed above include several state contractors, companies closely regulated by state government, lobbyists and appointees of Beshear to important state boards. These other big donors include:

Morgan Collins Yeast and Salyer, of London, $25,000. Lawyers in the firm have been large and consistent donors to Beshear. Beshear appointed partner McKinnley Morgan to chair the Kentucky Personnel Board.
State highway contracting companies headed by the Cleary family of Tompkinsville, $15,000.
LG&E of Louisville, $10,000.
McGhee Engineering of Guthrie, $10,000
Nine engineers with state engineering contractor GRW each gave $1,000 to total $9,000.

Donors listed as giving $5,000 during the period include: Beshear’s father, former Gov. Steve Beshear; Nachiketa Bhatt of Prospect, who heads Freedom Adult Day Healthcare; Joe Ellis, a Benton optometrist appointed to the Board of Optometry by Beshear; David Figg of Beaver Dam, an appointee of Beshear’s to the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees; Hal McCoy of Hopkinsville, husband of Elizabeth McCoy who was appointed to the UK Board by Beshear; Frank Shoop, the Georgetown car dealer who recently stepped down as a UK trustee; Leslie Haney, a Lexington engineer with EA Partners, which has long held state contracts; and lobbyists Sherman Brown and Bob Babbage.

Fire restrictions are now in place across Utah, amid what Gov. Spencer Cox called “terrible conditions” fueling a number of blazes, including the 48,000-acre Monroe Canyon Fire.  
Speaking from Richfield on Friday near the fire, Cox said the entire state is a tinder box. 
“These terrible conditions that are making it impossible for us to get ahead of this fire exist in every corner of the state right now,” Cox said. “It would be very easy to have more fires like this one, so we need people to be incredibly cautious.”

Burning east of Interstate 70 near Richfield, the Monroe Canyon Fire is the largest blaze in Utah this year. It’s grown by more than 10,000 acres in recent days, and is just 7% contained. More than 1,000 firefighters are working around the clock, with a focus on protecting structures. 
“You’re getting 60-mile-per-hour winds and we’ve had a few near misses with firefighters who had to cut their way out of the trees with a chainsaw. Fortunately, we’ve had no real serious accidents and the firefighters can go home to their families,” said state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican from Richfield, speaking to reporters alongside Cox on Friday. 
A number of transmission lines have been burned, causing periodic power outages in the area, and at least seven structures have been destroyed. Residents in Burrville, Monroe Canyon, and parts of Poverty Flat are under evacuation orders. 
“This is a big one. It’s been a long time since we’ve had a big one like this. The odds of us putting it out anytime soon are pretty low, just to be honest. We know that the forecast is not great right now. We’ve seen erratic fire behavior all day long, even at night,” Cox said. “We’ve seen a fire make a five-mile run. You can’t stop a fire when it’s making a run like that.” 
The temperature and precipitation outlook for the rest of the month, according to the National Weather Service, calls for below average rain and above average temperatures. It’s been exceptionally dry around the state, with humidity as low as 4% in the Monroe Canyon area. 
Cox declares state of emergency as intense wildfires burn in Utah

“It’s August and we’re not in good shape right now. And we’re not seeing any moisture in sight,” said Jamie Barnes, director of the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.  
To that end, state officials imposed stage two fire restrictions on Thursday. That means the following is prohibited: 

Fires and campfires, even in developed camping or picnic areas.  
Smoking, except in an enclosed vehicle or building, at a developed recreation site, or on a paved area. 
Fireworks, tracer ammunition, exploding targets or other pyrotechnic devices. 
Cutting, welding or grinding metal near vegetation. 
Operating a motorcycle, chainsaw, ATV or other small internal combustion engine without a working spark arrestor. 

These restrictions apply to all state and private, unincorporated land, including state trust land, state parks and wildlife management areas. They also apply to the following federal lands: 

The Color Country, Canyon Country, Green River, Paria River and West Desert districts, managed by the Bureau of Land Management. 
Dixie, Fishlake and Manti-La Sal national forests, managed by the U.S. Forest Service. 

Violating the restrictions is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000. 
There are a number of other fires burning throughout Utah:

The Forsyth Fire, discovered on June 19, has burned almost 16,000 acres, destroyed more than a dozen homes and is now 99% contained. It’s located near the Pine Valley community, about 15 miles north of St. George. 
The Deer Creek Fire is burning along the Colorado-Utah border near the La Sal Mountains, outside of Moab. It is 17,700 acres and, as of Friday morning, 88% contained. 
Discovered Thursday, the Little Pole Fire in northern Box Elder County near the Idaho border is now 487 acres and 0% contained. 

Cox declared a 30-day state of emergency on Thursday related to wildfires. The order allows the government to use all available state resources “to protect lives, homes, livestock and drinking-water supplies threatened by this year’s severe fire season,” according to the governor’s office. It also allows for the deployment of the Utah National Guard if needed.

The department has sent letters to Pennsylvania and at least eight other states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.

Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

(Photo courtesy of the Woodbury County Sheriff's Office)A building contractor is suing the Woodbury County Law Enforcement Center Authority, alleging it publicly disclosed false and defamatory information about the company.
Hausmann Construction Inc. of Lincoln, Nebraska, is suing the authority, Woodbury County, the architectural firms Introba Inc. and Goldberg Group Architects (GGA), and construction manager The Baker Group in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit stems from a long-running dispute over the design and construction of the $70 million Woodbury County Law Enforcement Center on 28th Street in Sioux City. The authority was created to facilitate the completion of the design and construction of the center, and Hausmann served as the prime or general contractor for the project.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit alleges the $43 million center that was initially contemplated by the parties in June 2021 is not the $70 million center that was constructed and exists today. “Throughout the life of the project, a multitude of issues have plagued the construction and completion of the Law Enforcement Center, stemming from certain design errors and omissions as put forth by GGA as the lead architect for the project,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit claims the alleged design errors brought the project “to a screeching halt in June 2023, which in turn has delayed almost every subsequent aspect of the project, increasing the ultimate cost of the project, and thereby bringing about” the current lawsuit.
According to the lawsuit, Hausmann unfairly “bears the brunt of many of the accusations for the overall delay in completion.” As recently as July 2, 2025, the lawsuit alleges, the authority acknowledged that the delay in completion of the project stemmed from the design errors. Despite that, the lawsuit claims, the authority has continued to “craft its own narrative of the issues plaguing the project to save GGA, Introba, and Baker Group from incurring additional expenses.”
On July 3, 2025, the authority, along with Woodbury County, allegedly sent a “confidential” 22-page demand letter to Hausmann, GGA, and Introba to facilitate settlement discussions. Despite knowing that the confidential letter was subject to disclosure under Iowa’s Open Records Law, the authority and county crafted the letter to include “various false and defamatory statements against Hausmann regarding Hausmann’s performance on the project,” the lawsuit claims.
Hausmann’s other projects and future projects have allegedly “been impacted by the authority’s release” of the letter, as “numerous news outlets have created damaging articles about Hausmann based on untrue and unsubstantiated allegations” within the letter, the lawsuit states.
“It is apparent that the authority, GGA, Introba, and Baker Group have very close outside relationships with each other, demonstrating a clear conflict of interest,” the lawsuit alleges, asserting that Baker Group hired the son of one authority member to oversee and manage the construction of the project.
“Given the cozy relationship between the authority, GGA, Introba, and Baker Group, it has been easiest for the authority to blame Hausmann for delays and refuse to pay Hausmann for its completion of the project,” the lawsuit claims.
In June 2023, for example, it was discovered that that design plans had failed to include fire and smoke dampers in the building’s heating, cooling and ventilation systems.  “The omission of the dampers was a clear design error and a life-safety threat where occupants could not be evacuated in the event of a fire at the authority’s facility,” the lawsuit alleges.
Construction of the building was completed last year and it is now occupied and operational. But as a result of the various delays, the authority has allegedly refused to pay Hausmann for $5.7 million that the company says it is owed for its work.
The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and unjust enrichment by the authority, professional negligence by Introba and GGA, and tortious interference with business relationships by each of the defendants.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Woodbury County attorney could not be reached for comment Friday.

(Getty Images)Two new Louisiana abortion restriction laws took effect Friday, including one that allows Louisianians to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing medications. 
House Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, was dubbed the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act.” It extends the window for abortion lawsuits to be filed from three to five years after the abortion occurs and allows out-of-state doctors and activists to be sued.
The legislation is part of an effort from anti-abortion advocates to crack down on doctors who ship abortion-inducing medication to states where the procedure is illegal. In nearly all instances, abortion has been illegal in Louisiana since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
Also taking effect is House Bill 425 by Rep. Josh Carlson, R-Lafayette, which expands the definition of coerced abortion. It is now defined in state law as the “use or threatened use of force, control, or intimidation” against a pregnant woman to compel her to undergo an abortion against her will, regardless of whether the procedure has been attempted or completed.
Carlson’s legislation originally sought to expand the definition of coerced abortion to include the pregnant person’s actions. It was substantially trimmed back in committee to add battery, assault, simple kidnapping, false imprisonment and extortion involving another person. 
The two bills easily passed the Republican-supermajority legislature earlier this year, although both were whittled down from their original, far-sweeping versions. 
Ventrella’s law has the support of Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is currently prosecuting a New York doctor accused of providing abortion-inducing medication to the mother of a pregnant minor in West Baton Rouge Parish. Gov. Kathy Hochul has refused to extradite the doctor to Louisiana to face the charges, citing New York’s shield laws. 
The doctor and the minor’s mother were both indicted. Murrill has alleged the minor was coerced to take the medication, though her mother was not charged with that crime.
Murrill and other attorneys general called on Congress this week to prevent states where abortion is legal from shielding doctors who prescribe abortion-inducing medication for people in states where the procedure is banned.

,DC,2025-08-01 19:14:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump levies a host of new tariffs on U.S. trading partners,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-levies-host-new-tariffs-us-trading-partners,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump pushed ahead with his promise to raise tariffs on foreign goods by Aug. 1, signing an order late Thursday increasing import taxes on products from nearly every U.S. trading partner.Trump’s directive, and new data on weaker job growth, sent markets tumbling Friday.The president imposed a 15% base tariff on products imported from nearly three dozen nations across five continents, plus the 27 trading nations that comprise the European Union. Trump slapped higher rates on select other countries, ranging from 18% on goods from Nicaragua to 30% on South Africa and 50% on Brazil.The White House hailed the “reciprocal” tariffs as “a necessary and powerful tool to put America First after many years of unsustainable trade deficits that threaten our economy and national security,” according to a press release accompanying the executive order.Trump describes the tariffs as “reciprocal” because they are his response to countries that have trade deficits with the U.S. — meaning that country sells more products to the U.S. than it buys.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer called the new rates “historic.”“Over the past few months, the President’s tariff program and the ensuing 'Trump Round' of trade negotiations have accomplished what the World Trade Organization and multilateral negotiations have not been able to achieve at scale: expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical American industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments and purchases of goods that will create great American jobs and help reassert American leadership in key strategic sectors,” Greer said in a statement Wednesday.The tariff announcement, combined with a weaker-than-expected jobs report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, caused sell-offs Friday from the three major U.S. stock indexes, according to financial media reports.Trump fumed Friday afternoon about report adjustments that significantly decreased jobs numbers for May and June, even calling for the commissioner for labor statistics to be fired.Tariffs and lawsuitsTrump made history earlier this year when he became the first president to trigger tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The move sparked legal challenges from small businesses and Democratic-led states, and the plaintiffs faced the Trump administration Thursday in federal appeals court.Tariffs are taxes on imported products that U.S. companies and other buyers pay to the U.S. government.Trump announced staggering tariffs under an emergency declaration on April 2, what he referred to as “Liberation Day,” but delayed the new import taxes after global markets plummeted in response to the shock announcement.Trump also separately announced Thursday a 35% levy on imported products from Canada that fall outside the bounds of an already established trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.Trump continued a 25% tariff on certain Mexican goods, but paused any rate increases to allow for 90 days of negotiations, according to media reports. The U.S. is continuing negotiations with China, whose products face a base import tax rate of 30%.Marc Noland, executive vice president and director of studies for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Trump’s latest tariff rates are “unfortunate.”“It will contribute to higher prices and slower growth here in the United States,” Noland said, adding there’s “a question about how sustainable they are legally here in the U.S.”“And it's particularly unfortunate, because I'm looking at the entire list of countries and see that the countries with the highest rates are the countries that are in the worst shape — Laos gets 40%, Syria got 41%,  Myanmar gets 40%. It's the poorest, most desperate countries that are getting hit with the highest tariffs. So it's bad for us and it's bad for the world,” Noland told States Newsroom in an interview Friday.The 15% rate on imports from dozens of countries mirrors the deals Trump announced in recent weeks with Japan, South Korea and European Union — though many details remain unknown.“There are real questions about what exactly did anybody agree to,” Noland said. “And you know this, these don't have the force of law that a treaty negotiated and passed by our Congress and somebody else's national legislature have like, say, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which, as we see, was unilaterally abrogated.”‘Predictable’ trade agenda urgedTrade and industry advocates have also reacted to the new tariffs.Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the Consumer Technology Association, issued a statement Thursday saying Trump’s new rates “highlight the uncertainty American innovators face in today’s trade environment.”“CTA continues to urge the Administration and Congress to pursue a predictable, forward-looking trade agenda rooted in fairness and collaboration with trusted partners,” said Shapiro, whose organization hosts the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada. “American innovation thrives when markets are open, trade rules are clear, and businesses are free to focus on creating jobs and bringing groundbreaking technologies to market.”The National Foreign Trade Council warned that “Whatever progress that’s ultimately achieved as part of these new trade deals will come at the steep price of significant U.S. tariff increases and the erosion of trust with America’s key partners.”The statement Thursday from the industry group’s president, Jake Colvin, continued: “Institutionalizing the highest U.S. duties since the Great Depression, coupled with ongoing uncertainty, will ultimately make American businesses less competitive globally and consumers worse off while harming relationships with close geopolitical allies and trading partners.”",,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

On June 30, the Trump administration informed states it would put $6.8 billion in federal K-12 school funding on hold. This funding, for migrant education and English Language Learning (ELL) programs, as well as before- and after-school services, had already received approval from Congress. But the administration said it paused disbursement of the money, which typically occurred July 1, while it conducted a review of the programs receiving funding.
The administration announced plans to release these funds to states July 25, after having completed the review. Though the funding is set to be available as schools start the academic year, some programs throughout the country have said the pause meant they had to stop programs during the summer and may face issues returning.

In Iowa, there have not been reports of any programs stopping service because of the federal funding freeze. With funding restored, programs at many school districts are proceeding as planned — but the federal government’s decision to conduct this review in July put some schools in a precarious position heading into the 2025-2026 school year.
Stacey Cole, superintendent of Storm Lake Community School District, said the district is “cautiously entering the school year with status quo” on funding these programs — but that the funding freeze will impact budget discussions in future years.
“I am concerned about this happening again,” Cole said.
The Storm Lake school district has a large ELL and immigrant student population. The funding would have impacted both after-school and English learning programming, she said. Other services the school district offers also would have been affected, such as those that help immigrant families navigate the U.S. school system with assistance filing needed paperwork, getting insurance and other ways to adjust to their new community.
The funding for these programs had been approved earlier in 2025, largely going toward staff, Cole said, before the freeze was even announced. But the federal government action means the district will likely have to view the future of these programs differently moving forward, she said.
“When we enter this school year, we still have those people in place, the programs will be in place, all the things. But as we navigate the waters this year, anytime there’s an opportunity to think, ‘well, is that something that we could live without?’ We’re going to be thinking about that. Because I’m not confident that we won’t have a similar message next July, and I’m going to have to be prepared for that.”
Theron Schutte, superintendent of the Marshalltown Community School District, said his district had faced a nearly $600,000 shortfall because of the funding pause. These federal dollars went toward historically underserved communities, he said, like low-income, English Second Language (ESL) and migrant students and their families, he said, as well as some students with special education needs, through programs like after-school tutoring for migrant students, swim lessons and summer school lessons.
As more than one-third of the Marshalltown school district’s student population are English language learners, the funding freeze was a major concern as the district looked at how it could continue to provide support for the families that rely on these programs, he said.
“It would have a huge impact, because we have a very large immigrant population in Marshalltown,” Schutte said. “Some of those services that would have been significantly reduced and jobs lost would have been in our Welcome Center, where we have staff that are devoted to helping orientate and register new families into the district, and to be able to accommodate families that speak different languages.”
The Marshalltown school district did not have to stop any programs from the funding pause this year. But during the pause, the school district was considering having to close or reduce services in the following year, Schutte said.
Even though the funding was restored, there are still questions about whether federal education funding pauses or cuts are on the horizon, he said. Combined with lower K-12 education funding from the Iowa state government in the past decade, he said, school districts are left in an unstable position when these funds are not provided.
Cole said the federal freeze for ELL and migrant programs will have an impact on how school districts will evaluate other programs and areas that receive funding from the U.S. government.
“This felt like it came out of nowhere, and so it was something that we were extremely unprepared for,” Cole said. “I was not thinking in March that there would be an announcement that a significant portion of our federal dollars would not be coming. And so, as we think about that, I’m also cautious with funding streams that weren’t talked about, right? And so it’s really difficult for us to plan.”
Other Trump administration directives target education funding for migrant students
Though the funding for migrant and English Second Language K-12 students was restored, the Trump administration has also pursued other efforts focused on education funding that goes toward migrant families. In July, the U.S. Department of Education released a memo saying adult students without legal status must be banned from federally-funded classes, including English language, technical education and high school equivalency courses.
People taking these courses will be citizenship and immigration verification requirements, according to the guidance. But many impacted institutions, including some K-12 schools that offer career education courses, said they are unsure about the implementation of verification steps, as students are not required to provide citizenship paperwork or other documents.
Many immigrant students legally in the country also do not have access to documents needed to verify their status, advocates say.
Des Moines Area Community College will receive necessary funding for its adult education programming as a result of federal funding being released, with a new caveat that officials say could make administrative burdens even heavier and result in a chilling effect among potential participants.
Erica Spiller, DMACC vice president for student affairs, said the community college received a memo saying it will see the same amount of funding as in past years for these programs, coming in at $741,600. Just under $3.5 million in adult basic education funding will be awarded to community colleges across Iowa.
However, these dollars come with the new requirement that the colleges verify citizenship of those who take advantage of the programming, Spiller said. As an open access institution, Spiller said DMACC doesn’t have the systems in place to easily take on this task, so departments across the college would feel hit hard by the extent of the new work.
When DMACC opens registration for its noncredit English Language Learner classes and high school equivalency tests, both of which Spiller said receive federal dollars, lines long enough to wrap around the building form, filled with people hoping to get a seat. If the citizenship of each of these people will need to be checked before they sign up for a class, the college will have to figure out how the process is going to work and how complicated it will be.
“It’s going to take more staff, it’s going to take more time,” Spiller said.
Based on feedback Spiller has heard from the communities that utilize these services, she said the new rules will have a chilling effect on attendance. Programs focused on adult education are an important workforce driver, she said, and both Iowans and those who move here in the future need to be able to access them in order to gain skills that will make them more employable in the state.
“I’m concerned that if it does have a chilling effect, if people can’t access this, or don’t access this, it’s going to have an impact on our economy,” Spiller said.
A similar directive requiring citizenship verification has been issued for participation in Head Start, the federally funded preschool program, as well as for other Title X programs related to family planning.
Cole said it is unclear how these directives will impact the Storm Lake school district, or whether there will be new requirements on checking students’ or families’ documents for participation in other programs.
When thinking about these federal funding streams, she said, people may not realize the impact these services and programs have on their lives and their community, even if they do not directly interact with these programs. For example, Cole said, a child may not be in a program working with migrant students — but without that program, they may get less attention in class, as a teacher will have to focus more on catching other students up on certain material, or have to spend more time on classroom management.
“It’s easy to look at these funding streams and to push them off and make them someone else’s issue,” she said. “But the reality is, is that the loss of these funds are going to impact all kids. And I just want to make sure that people are thinking about that, and that the unintended consequences might be very detrimental to kids in our own lives that we really love and care about.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-01 19:04:24+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘On and on’: Jackson again gives its two cents on Pearl River flood study,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/01/on-and-on-jackson-again-gives-its-two-cents-on-pearl-river-flood-study/,Corps of Engineers draws mixed reaction and criticism to its latest Pearl River flood control study,"Throughout a fittingly stormy Thursday in Jackson, dozens of residents and public officials again lined up in front of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in what has felt like, to some, a never-ending cycle of hundred-page studies and hours-long town halls. 
In stereotypically bureaucratic fashion, the Corps’ July draft study for a flood control project on the Pearl River is the latest in a process that’s now lasted roughly 40 years.
At least one resident decided that, whichever proposal the agency moves forward with, if any, they’ve had enough. 
“I’m interested in a buyout, I want out,” said Thia Walker, a resident of the Canton Club neighborhood in northeast Jackson, adding her street had flooded that very afternoon. “It’s taken a long time for all these plans and alternatives and it seems like there’s never going to be plan that’s suitable for the masses.
“This will go on and on forever and I’m ready to get out.”

The Corps, in its July publication, narrowed its project selection to two options: “Alternative D1” and “Alternative E1.”
D1 is a scaled back version of the controversial “One Lake” plan that the project’s local sponsor — the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District, or the levee board — had pushed for years before the Corps decided against the idea. The proposal would dam the Pearl River and lower its banks, allowing water to pool between a stretch starting just north of Lakeland Drive to just below Interstate 20. The project would also include four sets of levees, including one for the Canton Club neighborhood.
Several residents and public officials, including recently elected Mayor John Horhn, gave their support to D1, praising its potential to deliver economic and recreational opportunities to a poor city facing a declining population. 
“This flood control project can be the spark that ignites that rebirth in our city,” Horhn said during the afternoon session at St. Philip’s Episcopal Church.

The proposal E1 copies D1 except for including a dam, meaning it wouldn’t include the colloquial “lake” people associate with D1. Not having a dam also makes E1 the cheaper option. The Corps estimates D1 could cost as much as $960 million, versus $788 million for E1. 
Some, though, criticized the Corps for already ruling out a third option, “Alternative A1,” which the agency says would only cost up to $22 million. A1, which is the only one of the three that wouldn’t alter the river or its banks, would include elevating and floodproofing structures as well as offering buyouts. But compared to the other two plans, the agency limits the scope of A1, including just one levee and only offering elevation and buyouts for certain structures. 
“Once more, we urge the Corps to expand A1 because it doesn’t go far enough,” said Jill Mastrototaro of Audubon Delta. 
The benefits in that option, the Corps says, is limited by how many property owners choose to participate. But Mastrototaro and others argued that A1 could produce more benefits if the agency simply expands its scope. The agency’s study shows that of the three proposals, A1 is the only one with positive net benefits.

Tributaries and drainage in Jackson
While Thursday’s conversation focused on the river itself, several residents brought up more immediate causes of flooding, such as clogged creeks and storm water drains. 
“I live in (the Mcleod neighborhood), and I know personally that our storm drains are failing,” said Greta Mack Harris. “I’m nervous to go home after I leave here. Our clogged and collapsing culverts cause flooding and damage our foundation, walls and plumbing.”
Others pointed to tributary flooding as more regular issue than Pearl River flooding. While the Corps’ study doesn’t address the river’s tributaries in Jackson, it does mention other ongoing efforts.
The Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission has three projects in the design phase, using U.S. Department of Agriculture funding, to reduce flooding along Hanging Moss Creek, Lynch Creek and Lake Ridgelea in Byram. The construction for those, however, isn’t set to begin until December 2028. The city of Jackson is also in the design phase of a flood reduction project along Eubanks Creek.
Downstream impacts
While the Corps maintains that neither D1 nor E1 would affect the river’s flow once it reaches Monticello, residents in Louisiana, where the Pearl River reaches downstream, are unconvinced. Brandon Davis, environmental planning chief for the agency’s Vicksburg district, admitted at a meeting in Slidell, Louisiana, on Wednesday that the Corps didn’t have the authority nor funding to fully study what would happen to the river south of Jackson, NOLA.com reported.

Davis clarified to Mississippi Today that other rivers impact the Pearl River once it reaches those places. 
“Those areas down in Monticello, Slidell have their own issues with bank caving and erosion,” he said. “But it’s not necessarily tied to what’s going on up here. You have the Strong River, Copiah Creek, other tributaries that are causing most of the issues you’re seeing there.”
The study notes that D1 and E1 would “likely adversely affect” several endangered or threatened species along the Pearl River, including three different types of turtles. D1, the Corps wrote, would impact a wider range of species, including the Gulf sturgeon, than E1. 
When asked what that impact could look like, Davis said those habitats included anywhere the project may “temporarily” affect. But as far as how affected the habitats would be, he said only that they wouldn’t be “completely eradicated.”
Comment period and next steps
The public comment period is still ongoing and ends on Aug. 18. The Corps encourages the public to visit its project website to see how to submit feedback.
Vicksburg District commander Col. Jeremiah Gipson said the process is on schedule to send a final study and recommendation to the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works by the end of 2025. Some residents asked the Corps to extend the ongoing comment period, which Gipson said would be his decision.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31182154/Pearl-River-flooding-public-meeting-4.jpg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Photo by Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho lost more than a third of its practicing obstetrician doctors after the state’s near-total abortion ban took effect, a new study published in a peer-reviewed academic journal confirms.
The study — published Thursday in the JAMA Network Open, a division of the Journal of the American Medical Association — found that Idaho lost 35% of its doctors who practiced in obstetrics. In total, Idaho lost 94 of those doctors out of 268 between August 2022 and December 2024, the study found.
Idaho’s abortion ban took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned national abortion protections. Some OB-GYNs, including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, said publicly that they were leaving because of the ban.
“These results provide a stark picture of a rapidly declining maternal health workforce in our state,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Edward McEachern, said in a statement.
The study appears to confirm findings from a report in February 2024 by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative that found Idaho lost 22% of its practicing obstetricians since the state’s abortion bans took effect.
Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws. Organizers are collecting signatures to qualify a ballot initiative in November 2026 that could end Idaho’s strict abortion bans and establish reproductive freedom rights.
“Since Idaho’s abortion ban went into effect, (the Idaho Medical Association) has raised the alarm about the unintended consequences of criminalizing medically necessary care for pregnant women,” Idaho Medical Association CEO Susie Keller said in a statement. “This study clearly shows how our legal environment is causing physicians to leave the state and making it more difficult to recruit new ones to take their place. Idaho is digging a physician workforce hole that will take years, if not decades, to fill.”
Over 40% of the obstetrics doctors Idaho lost since its abortion bans took effect moved out of state, the study found. More than a fifth retired, but some narrowed their medical practice focus to gynecology or stopped practicing in rural areas, the study found.
The study pulled information from publicly available professional credentialing sources, physician websites, national registries and confirmation from the doctors.
The vast majority of Idaho’s remaining OB/GYN doctors are practicing in the state’s seven most populated counties, the study found. Just 23 OB/GYN doctors practice in Idaho’s other 37 counties that are home to nearly a quarter of the state’s population, compared to 151 in Idaho’s seven most populated counties, according to the study.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)With most jobs, you have to give your boss an idea of where you are and what you are doing during the workday. Gov. Bob Ferguson, who works for the people of Washington state, has not been doing this consistently during his first seven months in office.
Ferguson has mostly abandoned the practice of sending out advisories, letting the press know where he will be and when. The rare calendar updates that do go out are typically incomplete and sometimes arrive after the fact.
Take, for example, the advisory his office sent for “the week of July 14-20.” It landed in our inboxes around 1 p.m. on Monday, July 14, and contained information about the governor’s schedule for one day: Monday, July 14, “Orcas Island Day.” 
The governor was scheduled to attend four meetings and events on the island between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. By the time we received the advisory, start times for three of the four had passed.
Most weeks this summer, the press has received no calendar updates at all.
This was the case last week, when Ferguson attended the Washington State Labor Council convention in Vancouver. His office did not send notice that he’d be there. We learned from the Labor Council that he’d be making remarks on the main stage.
A schedule for the governor we later obtained through a public records request showed he also met with union officials representing machinists, Teamsters and electrical workers.
That schedule also included meetings last week with the Quileute and Quinault tribal councils. He posted on social media about attending the opening of a new Quinault Indian Nation building that received funding from the state’s Climate Commitment Act.
Why does this matter? Washingtonians pay Ferguson’s $218,744 a year salary. It’s not unreasonable to think they should have some window into what he’s doing during the week — the events he’s turning out for, who he’s meeting with. It’s a reflection of his priorities.
The handful of public appearances Ferguson has given notice about since the legislative session, and its subsequent flurry of bill signings, wrapped up have often focused on criticizing the president or congressional Republicans.
We’ve covered these events. But the governor’s responsibilities extend beyond reacting to federal policy.
Even the basics of his whereabouts are often a mystery. Is he working at his office at the Capitol in Olympia, or spending most of his time in Seattle? Has he traveled out of state, leaving the lieutenant governor in charge for a day or two? Much of the time, it’s difficult to know.
This is why, going forward, we’ll include a new section in our Saturday newsletter, called “Where’s the governor?” Our goal is to recap some of what we do know each week about what Ferguson has been up to. (You can subscribe to our newsletter here.)
If Ferguson resumes sending out weekly calendars and more frequent advisories about where he will be and when, we’ll distill highlights. If his lack of transparency continues, we’ll keep doing our best to piece together how he’s spending his time.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 18:57:14+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge sends English Station cleanup dispute back to DEEP,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/english-station-power-plant-united-illuminating-new-haven/,The ruling came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated power plant.,"A Connecticut judge on Thursday ordered state officials to go back to their deliberations in a long-running dispute with United Illuminating over the cleanup of one of the utility’s former power plants, English Station.
The ruling — which is almost certain to add further delays to the remediation effort — came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated plant and develop the site into a waterfront park complete with walking trails and a public pool.
“While this is not the only dispute that has interfered with the remediation of the English Station site, originally contemplated to have been completed years ago, the parties’ dispute over the applicable cleanup standard inside the buildings is a significant impediment to completing that project,” Superior Court Judge John B. Farley wrote in his decision.
United Illuminating operated the plant for more than a half century, burning coal and later oil to produce electricity for its customers, before the plant was finally powered down in 1992.  During its run, the site became heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, resulting in a complex and costly remediation effort. 
Over the years, the plant fell into disrepair and was subject to vandalism and thefts of leftover metal. As part of a deal with regulators to approve UI’s merger with Spanish utility giant Iberdrola in 2015, the company agreed to spend $30 million to clean up the site.
That agreement, however, quickly became subject to a dispute over the standard to which the property should be cleared of contaminants and made ready for development.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, led by Commissioner Katie Dykes, argued that the consent decree signed by both parties required UI to remediate PCB levels in the plant building to below 1 part per million, which would allow for a wider range of future uses, such as housing, businesses or recreation. Utility officials balked, arguing that doing so would require the complete demolition of the building — something they had not agreed to do during negotiations over the agreement.
Last year, Dykes issued a ruling requiring UI to abide by the higher remediation standard. UI promptly sued, arguing that Dykes had overstepped her authority and misconstrued the language in the consent decree to suit the state’s desire for a more robust cleanup.
In his decision on Thursday, however, Judge Farley opted not to side with either party’s interpretation of the consent decree, which he said was ambiguous as to the required level of cleanup.
Instead, Farley remanded the case back to DEEP for further proceedings. At the same time, he found that Dykes had not abused her authority by issuing a declaratory ruling, thus allowing her to make further decisions regarding the consent decree.
In a statement Friday, United Illuminating spokesperson Sarah Wall Fliotsos said the company appreciated the decision to sustain their appeal and send the case back to DEEP. 
“In this case, DEEP wrongfully changed the standard for clean-up that was agreed upon nearly a decade ago,” Fliotsos said. “It is clear DEEP was wrong to try to enforce a standard that was not part of the original agreement, and they are wrong to continue to blame UI for delays.”
“Ultimately, clean-up of this site cannot be achieved without clarity on the standard we are working towards,” she added. “As this issue is remanded for further proceedings, we hope to be able to work in good faith with state officials to chart a clear path forward for UI’s role in the future of English Station.”

DEEP officials referred comment to Attorney General William Tong’s office, which represented the agency in the lawsuit. Tong told the CT Mirror on Friday that his office is still reviewing the judge’s decision and its impact on the cleanup process.
“We’re gonna keep fighting,” Tong said. “UI owes whatever it takes to remediate English Station, and I’m never going to come off that position.”
A spokesman for New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said Thursday that the ruling would not impact the city’s plans to move ahead with the proposed redevelopment of English Station.
“As the City advances its proposal for Mill River Park, it’s critical that UI stop dragging its feet and complete the remediation of English Station so that this land can finally be put to good public use, and we’re confident the Attorney General and CT DEEP will continue to hold UI accountable for its longstanding failure to clean up this site,” the spokesman, Lenny Speiller, said in a statement.
“We hope the City’s proposal and intended use of the site brings a new focus and urgency on what needs to be done to help make this vision a reality,” he added.
The city’s proposal is part of a larger plan to redevelop former industrial areas along the Mill River, which surrounds the small island on which the power plant sits. 
In order to make the land safe for walking, playing and swimming, the site would have to be cleaned to the 1 ppm level being sought by DEEP, Speiller said. Even then, the city has estimated it will cost at least another $25 million to develop its park proposal.
“After bearing the costs of industrial pollution and blight from the English Station power plant for decades, our community deserves a true treasure in its place,” Elicker said in his announcement of the city’s plans on Monday. “By replacing it with a new waterfront public park and recreation area, we will transform this site into an amazing public asset that will benefit our residents, improve our environment and strengthen our community for generations to come.”
Beyond the initial cleanup, however, other hurdles exist that could complicate the city’s plans. 
New Haven still has to acquire the English Station property, which has changed hands several times over the last two decades. On Monday, city officials sent letters to the current owners of the island expressing their desire to “negotiate a fair purchase price” for the property. If the owners do not respond, Speiller said, the city will consider using eminent domain to acquire the property.
The owners are a pair of limited liability corporations tied to three people — George Goldstein, Esther Schiller and David Tropper — with business addresses listed in Brooklyn, Queens and Israel.
When reached for comment earlier this week, Goldstein at first denied being one of the owners of English Station before saying he had received the city’s letter and was reviewing it. “I have to get back to you on that,” Goldstein said when asked if he was interested in selling the property.
Schiller and Tropper could not be reached for comment. Goldstein hung up after being reached for comment a second time on Friday.
Local advocates have also questioned the need to tear down the hulking, brick-clad structure of English Station, which many argue carries historic and aesthetic significance to the city.
Anstress Farwell, the president of the New Haven Urban Design League, said this week that she supported the city’s efforts to take control of the power plant property, though she called its plans to raze the remaining buildings “premature” until further studies can be done to determine whether they are salvageable.
“In all of my talks with the city, it’s been about ‘the building is an asset,'” Farwell said. “It’s 110,000 square feet that city officials have said that they could never rebuild on the site but could use if it could be renovated.”
Nor did Thursday’s ruling put an end to the state’s ongoing legal battle against UI over English Station.
Tong filed a separate lawsuit last year, accusing the utility of failing to uphold its agreement to spend $30 million on the remediation effort. In response, UI officials have argued that the company has already spent millions toward the remediation of the site, including removal of asbestos, but that its efforts have been hampered by the ongoing dispute with DEEP.
That case is also assigned to Judge Farley, who issued a separate ruling on Thursday dismissing four out of the five defenses that the utility had raised. That case is currently set for trial in October 2026.
Lastly, there is the case involving the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s decision in 2023 to begin fining United Illuminating $2 million a year over what regulators called a failure to abide by the utility’s agreement to remediate English Station. Earlier this year, a judge upheld the legality of that penalty — a decision that the utility is appealing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ENGLISH-STATION-01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana state Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, created and leads a new task force that will study name, image and likeness issues for college and high school athletes. 
You can also listen to a version of this interview on the latest episode of our podcast, “The Light Switch.”

Piper Hutchinson: NIL is such a fun topic, but I think some people don’t know what it is. Can you kind of explain what NIL is? 
Rep. Rashid Young:  NIL is an acronym for name, image and likeness, and it’s something that came about around 2020, 2021. It’s where athletes, college and or high school athletes are able to be paid off of their name, image and likeness. It’s very similar to the endorsement deals that professional athletes have been able to get for a while, and it started as players being able to use their name, image and likeness to get endorsement deals, and it has since morphed into something much more. 
Now we’re having conversations about revenue sharing. We’re having conversations about student athletes potentially becoming employees, but at its core, it is about the name, image and likeness of student athletes. 
  Rep. Rashid Young (Louisiana Legislature)
Hutchinson: You’re interested in this because you yourself were a student athlete. Is that right?
Young: Yeah, I was a student athlete for a while, and always loved sports from the time I was a little kid. Played it, I enjoyed it. And then after undergrad, I started doing some coaching and teaching as well. So I was really able to get into the development of other young players and then, you know, I later started practicing law. 
So now my passions are sort of intertwined between sports and law and legislating, and so this NIL space just seems to fit really well with my skill set and my passions.
Hutchinson: And you played football at Grambling back before NIL times? 
Young: I did. I played ball, that was before NIL was even thought of, and it’s funny because we would see our name on, like, the NCAA sports games, and we would be so excited, “Oh, look, I’m on the roster. I’m in the game.” But had we been able to capitalize and be paid off of it, that would have been great.
Hutchinson: It has been kind of a game changer. So you’ve got this task force. You just had your first meeting last week, but this started with some legislation. Tell me about the legislation and why it didn’t move forward.
Young:  Last session, I brought a piece of legislation that would have exempted the first $12,500 from being taxed by Louisiana for all NIL deals. And there was another colleague that brought legislation where he tried to exempt the entirety of NIL payments to students, both in the same spirit. Neither piece of legislation moved forward. 
My piece of legislation, it was my choice to not move it forward. I decided not to bring it for a committee vote after speaking with several members in the body, and I think the general consensus was that our body needed to be more informed on what NIL is, how that particular legislation could benefit the state and benefit the universities. 
So this task force is sort of one of those fact-seeking, information-finding initiatives where we’ll be able to go back to the legislature and say, “Hey, this is what our higher ed athletic directors and coaches are saying. This is how we can be competitive as a state and hopefully to be able to move some legislation like that forward in 2026.”
Hutchinson: What topics do you think the task force is going to cover and make recommendations on?
Young: We are looking at evaluating the effectiveness of the current NIL frameworks and university compliance. We’re looking at protecting student athletes from exploitation or inequitable agreements. Then we’re looking at recommending best practices that support the financial stability and competitive integrity of higher education athletic departments. 
I think that’s a huge undertaking. I think to be able to get some meaningful recommendations after five or six meetings is going to be really tough, but I think we have a good working group. I’m hopeful that we’ll walk away from the task force with some meaningful recommendations. 
Hutchinson: One of the big topics at the first meeting was the issue of international athletes and NIL. Why is that so tricky?
Young: I don’t claim to be the expert in international law. But from my understanding, there are work restrictions that the international students have. Their visas have certain work restrictions. I’m understanding that it’s going to come down to how we define income for international athletes. So are we defining it as passive income, which wouldn’t be violating the work requirements? Or are we define it as active income, which could potentially violate the terms of their visas? 
It’s a huge issue. We heard from quite a few athletic directors from across the state that are saying that a large portion of their athletic base is, in fact, international students, and so that’s something that we’re going to be looking to address. 
And look, it is a complex issue because you’re dealing with visas, you’re dealing with tax code definitions. All of that is something that I’m confident that this legislature can start to address and if we need to partner with folks on a federal level, I think we can do that.
Hutchinson: One of the things that surprised me from that first meeting was that there’s nothing in Louisiana law about NIL for high school athletes. We’ve got these kids running around making these NIL deals. Do you think regulating that is going to come up in the legislation?
Young: I think we are certainly going to propose something. I think we heard from a couple of representatives from the high school level, and one in particular, our legendary coach, JT Curtis. He was very passionate about what he’s seeing. He talked about predatory agents and marketing representation environment for high schools. 
I think it’s incumbent upon us as a state to step in and say, “Hey, how can we support our high school athletes?” So that’s certainly something that we’re looking at, and hopefully something we can move forward in 2026. 
Hutchinson: At the end of the day, we’re talking about young kids and pretty big sums of money. So there’s a need to protect them, right? 
Young: Absolutely, yeah, we’re talking about young kids, pretty big sums of money. We’re talking about their parents. We’re talking about their parents being able to understand what their kids are signing? And look, I’m a lawyer in my time when I’m not here in the legislature, and we know that you have to be 18 to be able to legally contract. There are some exceptions to the law, but we want to make sure that the parents and the kids understand from the beginning that if you’re not legally able to contract, then you shouldn’t be subjected to certain predatory suggestions from agents or people that claim to be agents. So that’s one of the areas that we want to look at. 
But at the end of day, it’s about protecting our babies. It’s about protecting our kids. And one of the things that the coach said that I thought was great, he talked about their mental health. That’s really important because we don’t want our most vulnerable in our population, our youth, to take hits to their mental health because we fail to regulate a particular area of law, so we want to step in and see how we can help.

Article Summary



The Chicago Cubs will host the 2027 MLB All-Star Game, the team’s fourth time hosting the event.
The announcement comes amid state- and city-backed security upgrades surrounding Wrigley Field being approved.
The 2027 season could be impacted by labor disputes between MLB players and owners.



This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO — The Chicago Cubs will host their fourth Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2027.
The announcement, made Friday by MLB and Cubs officials, was attended by a cadre of elected officials, including Chicago’s mayor and several Chicago alderpeople, Gov. JB Pritzker, several state lawmakers and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.
The 2027 game would give Wrigley Field the record for most games hosted by an active ballpark. Wrigley Field previously hosted the All-Star Game in 1947, 1962 and 1990.
Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, a “congenital Sox fan who grew up watching the Cubs on television,” said the news is “terrific.”
“I think any opportunity we have to showcase the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois to a national or international audience — whether its NASCAR or the President’s Cup or the 2027 All-Star Game — is good for all of us,” Harmon, of Oak Park, said.
Wrigley Field, which opened in 1914, underwent a $1 billion renovation project throughout the 2010’s in connection to its efforts to someday host another All-Star Game, according to Cubs executive Crane Kenney.

Further upgrades to the security infrastructure around Wrigley are likely coming, with the current plan including $12 million from the state and up to $10 million from the city to install new bollards designed to stop vehicles and move some of the infrastructure in front of Wrigley Field.
“I’m very proud to have worked with the General Assembly to provide security enhancements to bolster public safety around the park,” Pritzker said. “I’m also a proud Cubs fan, so that made it especially easy.”
Cubs chairman and part-owner Tom Ricketts said the state and city have been involved in renovations for longer. Wrigley, nicknamed the Friendly Confines, is located on the city’s North Side, bounded by Clark and Addison streets and Waveland and Sheffield avenues.
“People don’t know this, but Addison is actually a state road,” Ricketts said. “We needed cooperation from the city to move some sidewalks and to help with security efforts. I just really appreciate the governor and the mayor stepping up to make this happen.”
Ricketts emphasized the All-Star Game and other associated events will bring people to the city.
“We’ll have events at Navy Pier, we’ll do the Home Run Derby on the night before, we’ll have other games, and they also bring the Major League Baseball draft,” Ricketts said. “So it’ll be an incredible week for Chicago.”

That’s if the game happens at all. There is increasing tension between MLB players and owners as they approach the end of the current collective bargaining agreement in December 2026.
Once that contract ends, it could result in a lockout and potentially the first canceled regular-season games since a player strike in the mid-90s, not counting games that were canceled during the pandemic. If the season is impacted severely enough, the All-Star Game may be canceled altogether.
The game is scheduled for July 13, 2027.

(Provided by US Army Corps of Engineers)A food or beverage company is eyeing Orangeburg County for a possible new packaging and distribution facility.
Little else is known about the company, referred to by the code name, “Project Panther,” as economic development officials negotiate a deal to bring the facility to the county in the center of the state.
The county and state economic development agency have filed for a permit with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to fill in more than seven acres of wetlands on the 918-acre site south of the town of Orangeburg.
Those plans do not include any information on how much the company may invest or how many people it may hire. County economic development officials did not immediately respond to messages left by the SC Daily Gazette.
The application says the company has a need for access to rail and the interstate. Plans show an initial phase on the south end of the site with future phases expanding to the north and east.
The massive site is near Orangeburg’s municipal airport as well as existing industry, including a Hill’s pet food plant, cable maker The Okonite Company, Indevco plastics, metal powder supplier Ecka Granules and paving materials company Walker Emulsions.
The public has until Aug. 14 to comment on the application.
Electric vehicle battery-related company plans to build $1B plant in Orangeburg

The permit application follows another code-named deal, “Project Rhino,” under consideration by the county since March. That project, The Times and Democrat reported, could bring more than 600 new jobs to the area.
Last year, Orangeburg County netted its largest economic deal ever: a $1 billion dollar battery materials manufacturer.

Janet Mills gives her state of the budget address in January 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Amid uncertainty over federal funding and the impact of steeper tariffs announced by the Trump administration Friday, Maine ended the fiscal year with a $152.2 million general fund surplus, nearly $60 million more than in 2024. 
The Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services reported this figure on Friday, following the end of the fiscal year on June 30. The state’s Budget Stabilization Fund, also known as the rainy day fund, has also reached a record $1.03 billion, the maximum prescribed in statute.
Also this week, Fitch Ratings, a top international credit rating agency, upgraded its bond credit for Maine, Gov. Janet Mills and State Treasurer Joe Perry announced Friday. The agency increased Maine’s rating from “AA” to “AA+” — its second highest rating — noting the state’s “proven ability to maintain significantly improved dedicated operating reserves through a challenging budget cycle.” 
“Governor Mills’ and the Legislature’s fiscal policies have allowed us to build significant cash reserves, creating flexibility and security for the state,” said Perry, who was a former Democratic state representative. “This ratings upgrade from Fitch affirms that we are on a good path.”
The news comes after Mills and the state financial office have repeatedly warned about a projected overall revenue shortfall in the coming years, arguing that the state needs to tighten its belt and avoid new major spending commitments.
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, Sharon Huntley, director of communications for DAFS, explained that the surplus comes from the current fiscal year and is not related to the biennial budget that was set in June. 
Gov. Mills vows lean budget in light of projected revenue shortfall

Maine was facing a projected $450 million deficit, as well as an immediate funding gap to cover the cost of MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, when crafting that budget this year. 
The Maine Legislature failed to pass emergency spending to address the short-term deficit after Senate Republicans held out support, leading to delayed payments to providers. 
The Democratic majority of the Legislature then pushed through a two-year budget in March without Republican support that continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing some one-time funding for urgent needs, such as Medicaid, and in June passed a budget addition. That addition did not make as many program cuts or tax hikes as Mills requested.
One of the ways lawmakers managed to reject some of those cost-saving measures was by making use of unanticipated agency surpluses. For example, the budget paid for Medicaid in part by adding surplus cash at the end of the 2025 fiscal year into what’s called the “cascade,” a legislative authorization transferring available surplus funds at the close of the fiscal year after all statutory and financial commitments are met.  
After transfers to Medicaid and other statutory priorities, Maine law requires the remaining surplus to be divided, with 80% going to the budget stabilization fund and 20% to the highway and bridge capital fund. This year’s cascade resulted in $79.4 million added to the budget stabilization fund and $33.8 million to the highway fund.
“The nearly $34 million will be used to ensure this year’s construction as defined in our three-year work plan is adequately funded,” said Bruce Van Note, commissioner of the Maine Department of Transportation, who is retiring this month. “The plan includes projects that will improve roads and bridges, enhance safety, and increase economic opportunity through upgraded transportation infrastructure across the state.”
While celebrating the savings and upgraded credit rating, Mills highlighted in a statement that uncertainty with federal funding remains.
“Over the past six years, my administration has worked hard to invest in Maine people, improve our economy, and produce responsible, balanced state budgets,” Mills said. “I look forward to maintaining this progress for Maine people, despite the needless economic challenges and uncertainty coming from Washington.”
Maine has faced funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration, as have other states, in addition to what’s widely been considered retribution from the Trump administration over the state’s protections for transgender people. 
The administration also went ahead with implementing its sweeping tariffs that had been postponed until Friday. Now amounting to import taxes at levels not seen since the 1930s, these tariffs are expected to hurt Maine’s economy, notably due to Canada as the state’s largest trading partner and major source of tourism.
Because of uncertainty with federal funding and the economy, specifically impacts from tariffs, Maine’s Revenue Forecasting Committee discussed this spring possibly revising projections ahead of its next scheduled update on Nov. 1 but has so far made no such plans. 
As the end of the federal fiscal year approaches on September 30, U.S. Congress is also facing a possible government shutdown if it fails to pass appropriations bills by then, indicating the likelihood of another stop gap funding bill to avoid that.

(Photo courtesy pf DMACC)A former Des Moines Area Community College administrator, fired after making a comment about having “pulled a knife” on someone, is now suing the school, alleging age and racial discrimination.
Kim Jackson of Des Moines, who ran DMACC’s Upward Bound program for 20 years, is suing the school in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Jackson alleges she was employed by DMACC for a total of 26 years until she was abruptly and wrongfully terminated on July 2, 2024. She alleges she filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and that the EEOC subsequently issued her a formal notice of her right to sue, clearing the way for her lawsuit.

Jackson alleges the school fired her for the pretextual reasons of gross misconduct and conduct unbecoming a supervisor.
The lawsuit notes that in November 2024, an administrative law judge with the Iowa Unemployment Insurance Appeals Bureau conducted a hearing on Jackson’s unemployment benefits claim and later ruled that, contrary to what DMACC had claimed, Jackson had not engaged in workplace misconduct.
According to the findings of the judge in that case, Jackson had raised her voice during a discussion with other Upward Bound employees in June 2024. Jackson had “a family connection” to two students who were being discussed and the other Upward Bound employees felt Jackson had been favoring the two and treating them differently than the other students in the program.
After being told the two students were rude and behaving in an “entitled” manner, Jackson allegedly responded that if one of the two had made the comments attributed to him it was not appropriate, stating loudly, “If he spoke to you like that, he needs to be corrected. He did not come from a family where that is okay.”
The judge found that Jackson “did not yell at the other employees, use profanity, threaten anyone, or disagree with the premise of the conversation.”
The judge noted that two days later, Jackson apologized to her colleagues for having raised her voice. While explaining that she tried to control her anger, Jackson referenced an incident from her youth when she pulled a knife on someone when she was angry — a comment some of her DMACC colleagues allegedly took as a threat, the judge found.
She was later fired for her conduct.
As a result of the unemployment hearing, Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson awarded Jackson jobless benefits, finding there was no workplace misconduct that would disqualify her.
“I do not believe Ms. Jackson referencing ‘pulling a knife’ on someone in her youth was a threat, but an explanation of why she no longer acts on her anger today,” Johnson ruled. “I do not think anyone in that meeting reasonably believed it was a threat, given that they all remained in the meeting and did not flee or call 911 or Campus Security.”
The lawsuit alleges the school’s stated reasons for firing Jackson were pretextual and that that DMACC’s Human Resources Department had been trying to get her to take early retirement since 2020, when she was roughly 60 years old.
“When Jackson was terminated, she was the only Black DMACC employee at a director-level position,” the lawsuit alleges. “Jackson’s responsibilities and roles were replaced by two white females who were more than 10 years younger than Jackson.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including back pay and punitive damages, for discrimination and retaliation.
DMACC has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The school’s spokesperson could not be reached for comment late Thursday.

Workers comfortable with technology used it most, according to a report from the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Research at NC Central University. A few rarely used it. 
Workers felt best about using ChatGPT to write emails and letters, summarize meeting transcripts, find hidden or outdated information, and help with legal or compliance phrasing and documentation, according to the report. 
The report described 37% of the workers who participated in the pilot project as “super users” who used ChatGPT several times a day. Forty-eight percent were called “sporadic, general users” who deployed ChatGPT as needed for specific challenges. 
Seventy-one percent of ChatGPT users were positive about it, said Siobahn Day Grady, director of NCCU’s AI institute.
ChatGTP users found it did sometimes “hallucinate” or produce inaccurate information. It didn’t do well with coding, math-heavy, or legal work, the report said. 
“The technology is not perfect,” but neither are people, Grady said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis is questioning the federal government’s recruitment of Florida’s local and state police who are focused on enforcing immigration laws.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been recruiting officers with specialized training to work for the federal agency, ABC news reported Thursday.
“I know that there’s some sheriffs that have some strong feelings about it,” DeSantis said Friday during a news conference in Orlando, flanked by Florida Highway Patrol troopers and the members of the Florida Cabinet. 
ICE is “dangling like a lot of bonus money and all this other stuff,” as the governor put it, to local and state officers who’ve received partial or full training in enforcing immigration laws and participating in 287(g) agreements. 
“Why not recruit additional people to be supplementing that instead of just kind of displacing?” DeSantis said. 
He bragged that Florida has made a stronger effort than any other state in deputizing state and local law enforcement officers to act on behalf of ICE. According to data released this week from that agency, approximately 320 of the nearly 900 agencies in the United States that have signed agreements with ICE are in Florida. 
“That’s been a huge help to ICE right? Let’s just be clear, that’s been a huge benefit to those federal agencies. And so now, if you’re in a situation where those folks are being poached off of that mission, well it’s like, wait a minute, how is that? Why don’t you bring in new people to supplement a mission going forward?” DeSantis said. 
The agency has offered willing officers up to a $50,000 bonus, paid over five years, ABC reported. 
“I think we want to continue doing what we’re doing. But sheriffs losing deputies who are in this fight to just go wear a different jersey, basically, but still be in the fight, that doesn’t necessarily add to what we’re doing. It’s just moving someone over. And so I think there is frustration from that, and so, we’ll see,” DeSantis said. 
Also in the ABC report, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri called ICE’s outreach “wrong.”
“We have partnered with ICE like no other state to help ICE do its job of illegal immigration enforcement,” Gualtieri told the news organization. “ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership.”
DeSantis said he told sheriffs it’s up to them to “fight for what you think is right” and that he’s “heard a lot of static coming out of our sheriff’s departments” about the recruitment letters.

Everglades detention center
The news conference, nearly an hour and a half in length, featured the governor reciting the state’s record on immigration enforcement, including talking extensively about the Everglades deportation center that’s garnered national attention. 
The governor referenced news reports about the conditions inside the temporary facility. NBC reported “torturous conditions in cage-like units full of mosquitoes, where fluorescent lights shine bright on them at all times.”
“Phony narratives,” DeSantis called them but suggested: “Maybe they will have the intent, the effect, of deterring people from going there and choosing this option.”
State Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, responded to the governor’s news conference in a written statement.
“Ron DeSantis and his hand-picked Cabinet didn’t come to Orlando to solve problems — they came to peddle a half-billion-dollar anti-immigrant grift. While everyday Floridians are struggling with the cost of living, DeSantis is using taxpayer dollars to fund a secretive detention camp, rip families apart, and divert our public safety officials away from real community needs,” she said in a written statement.
“They talk about enforcing the law while breaking it — hiding contracts, denying people due process, and using an appointed Attorney General who was just found in contempt of court. They intimidate local elected officials and ignore home rule, not based on laws but on political agendas. This isn’t leadership. It’s lawlessness.
“Floridians deserve better than political theater. Shut down the Everglades camp, restore transparency, and start putting people before politics.”
In addition to the Attorney General James Uthmeir, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson, DeSantis was joined by Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Director Dave Kerner, FHP Director Gary Howze II, and State Board of Immigration Enforcement Director Larry Keefe. 
Republican leaders will gather in Orlando this weekend for the Florida Freedom Forum, a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Florida.

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/gender-affirming-care-lawsuit/,California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed suit seeking to overturn an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for people under 19.,"In summary
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed suit seeking to overturn an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for people under 19. 


Trump administration restrictions on gender-affirming care for transgender and nonbinary youth violate the Constitution and undermine state laws that require equal access to medical treatment, according to a lawsuit filed today by Attorney General Rob Bonta and 14 other states and the District of Columbia. 
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, targets a January executive order that makes it U.S. policy not to “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender transition for people under 19. The order threatens to pull federal funding from medical institutions that provide this type of care. 
“The result is an atmosphere of fear and intimidation experienced by transgender individuals, their families and caregivers, and the medical professionals who seek only to provide necessary, lawful care to their patients,” the attorneys general wrote in the suit.
This marks the 37th lawsuit California has filed against the Trump administration.
Gender-affirming care is legal and protected for people 18 years old and older in California. Certain treatments are also available to younger people with parental consent. The lawsuit comes as some of the largest medical providers in the state halt gender-affirming services.
The Trump administration has “trampled over state rights, overstepped their constitutional authority and endangered vulnerable minors and 18-year-olds,” Bonta said in a Friday press conference announcing the lawsuit alongside the attorneys general of Illinois and Connecticut. 
U.S. Department of Justice officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.
Providers scale back care
Following Trump’s executive order, the Justice Department directed employees to investigate doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that provided gender-affirming care. In July, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced in a statement that her department had issued more than 20 subpoenas to medical providers as it investigates “healthcare fraud, false statements and more.”
Fearing prosecution, providers have scaled back on providing this type of care, which has left many patients without critical medical care, Bonta said. The care includes hormone therapy, puberty blockers and surgical procedures. Research shows that gender-affirming care can positively impact the mental health of transgender youth. Forcing young people to wait until they are 19 or older to start care allows symptoms of gender dysphoria to worsen, Bonta said.
The state attorneys general argue that acceding to Trump’s orders puts providers at odds with states’ anti-discrimination and age-of-majority laws. In California, it is illegal to deny care on the basis of gender identity and gender expression. At the same time, many medical providers rely heavily on federal funding in the form of research and education grants, as well as reimbursements from public payer programs like Medi-Cal.
The directives from the Trump administration have already forced several providers to suspend services. Last month, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles closed its gender-affirming care center, forcing about 3,000 patients under 21 to look elsewhere for care. 
“The shutdown came despite efforts my office took over recent months to assure (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) that they were protected and required to provide gender-affirming care,” Bonta said.
Stanford Medicine has also paused surgical procedures for people under 19. And this week, Kaiser Permanente announced that it too would pause gender-affirming surgeries starting Aug. 29, noting that hormone therapies would still be available. 
The executive order being challenged is just one of several that Trump has issued targeting transgender people. Others include one that recognizes only two biological sexes, a second that prevents transgender girls and women from participating in women’s sports, and a third that threatens federal funds for schools that support transgender youth.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021325_CHLA-Gender-Affirming-Care-Demo_JWH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-01 14:56:52.139248

(Provided/Discover South Carolina)Faster internet could be coming to some South Carolina state parks.
Officials with the state parks department are evaluating parks with existing internet connections to determine which locations might benefit from higher-speed fiber optic cable, said spokeswoman Jayne Baker.
“This initiative aims to improve internet connectivity, support digital services and provide better experiences for visitors,” Baker said.
Visitors can access free Wi-Fi at 15 of the state’s 48 parks.
First on the docket for upgrades is Lake Greenwood State Park in Greenwood County. The parks department plans to pay internet company Upcountry Fiber nearly $100,000 to install high-speed internet at the park, according to a recent public notice.
Free Wi-Fi is already available at the 914-acre park’s office area and Drummond Center event space, according to its website.
A list of other parks that might get faster Wi-Fi was not available. Neither was a timeline for installation, Baker said.
Department staff are still evaluating which parks may or may not need upgrades, she said.
The need for faster internet has grown with increases in park attendance in recent years, department officials wrote in a request for state funding.
Wi-Fi at state parks helps staff stay connected, including during natural disasters and other emergencies, and also allows visitors to “have quick access to the information they need to make travel plans and decisions,” according to the agency budget request.
The Legislature set aside $200,000 to help improve information technology systems at park department-owned properties in the 2024-2025 budget, but no money was specifically designated for technology upgrades in the current fiscal year budget.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 18:06:40+00:00,CT Mirror,CT among states suing Trump over gender-affirming care,Associated Press and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/ct-among-states-suing-trump-over-gender-affirming-care/,The lawsuit comes after at least eight hospital systems — including two in CT — said they were stopping or restricting gender-affirming care.,"Seventeen Democratic officials accused President Donald Trump’s administration of unlawfully intimidating health care providers into stopping gender-affirming care for transgender youth in a lawsuit filed Friday.
The complaint comes after a month in which at least eight major hospitals and hospital systems — all in states, including Connecticut, where the care is allowed under state law — announced they were stopping or restricting the care. The latest announcement came Thursday from UI Health in Chicago.
Trump’s administration announced in July that it was sending subpoenas to providers and focusing on investigating them for fraud. It later boasted in a news release that hospitals are halting treatments.
The Democratic officials say Trump’s policies are an attempt to impose a nationwide ban on the treatment for people under 19 — and that’s unlawful because there’s no federal statute that bans providing the care to minors. The suit was filed by attorneys general from 15 states, including Connecticut, and the District of Columbia, plus the governor of Pennsylvania, in U.S. District Court in Boston.
“The federal government is running a cruel and targeted harassment campaign against providers who offer lawful, lifesaving care to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
Trump and others who oppose the care say that it makes permanent changes that people who receive it could come to regret — and maintain that it’s being driven by questionable science.
Since 2021, 28 states with Republican-controlled legislatures have adopted policies to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have a right to enforce those laws.
For families with transgender children, the state laws and medical center policy changes have sparked urgent scrambles for treatment.
Medical centers are responding to political and legal pressure
At a press conference in Hartford on Friday afternoon, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong criticized Yale New Haven Health and Connecticut Children’s Medical Center for recent announcements that they would stop providing medication treatment as part of their youth gender-affirming care services.
“I have expressed to them not just my disappointment, but the state’s profound disappointment, in their actions. And the state’s position is that the actions they have taken are wrong,” Tong said, though he added that the facilities are “between a rock and a hard place.”
Tong said senior leadership of both institutions told him they would provide gender-affirming care to patients under 19 if not for the threats from the federal government. However, he confirmed that, to his knowledge, none of the federal actions currently in effect directly threaten the hospitals’ Medicaid funding for providing such care. But that might not be true for long, he added.
“I’m not aware of a specific action at this moment,” Tong said. “But obviously we’re looking down the barrel at it.”
Heather Page, a parent of a trans child, said Yale New Haven Health’s decision sends the message that trans people do not deserve the same standard of care as everyone else. 
“It sends the message that they don’t matter and that they aren’t worth fighting for. This isn’t just about one program. It’s about the right to exist safely and access the care needed to thrive,” Page said.
Page said she’s made an appointment for her daughter at Boston Children’s Hospital, roughly an hour drive from the family’s home in Bethel.
The Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the biggest public provider of gender-affirming care for children in teens in the U.S., closed in July.
At least seven other major hospitals and health systems have made similar announcements, including Children’s National in Washington D.C., UChicago Medicine and Yale New Haven Health.
Kaiser Permanente, which operates in California and several other states, said it would pause gender-affirming surgeries for those under 19 as of the end of August but would continue hormone therapy.
Connecticut Children’s Medical Center cited “an increasingly complex and evolving landscape” for winding down care.
Other hospitals, including Penn State, had already made similar decisions since Trump returned to office in January.
Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, an organization that advocates for health care equity for LGBTQ+ people, said the health systems have pulled back the services for legal reasons, not medical ones.
“Not once has a hospital said they are ending care because it is not medically sound,” Sheldon said.
Trump’s administration has targeted the care in multiple ways
Trump devoted a lot of attention to transgender people in his campaign last year as part of a growing pushback from conservatives as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts. Trump criticized gender-affirming care, transgender women in women’s sports, and transgender women’s use of women’s facilities such as restrooms.
On his inauguration day in January, Trump signed an executive order defining the sexes as only male and female for government purposes, setting the tone for a cascade of actions that affect transgender people. About a week later, Trump called to stop using federal money, including from Medicaid, for gender-affirming care for those under 19.
About half of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of transgender issues, an AP-NORC poll found. But the American Medical Association says that gender is on a spectrum, and the group opposes policies that restrict access to gender-affirming health care.
Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person’s gender identity, including when it’s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It includes counseling and treatment with medications that block puberty, and hormone therapy to produce physical changes, as well as surgery, which is rare for minors.
In March, a judge paused enforcement of the ban on government spending for care.
The court ruling didn’t stop other federal government action
In April, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed government investigators to focus on providers who continue to offer gender-affirming care for transgender youth. “Under my leadership, the Department of Justice will bring these practices to an end,” she wrote.
In May, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report discouraging medical interventions for transgender youth and instead focusing solely on talk therapy. The report questions adolescents’ capacity to consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility. The administration has not said who wrote the report, which has been deeply criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates.
In June, a Justice Department memo called for prioritizing civil investigations of those who provide the treatment.
In July, Justice Department announced it had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in gender-affirming care for youth, saying they were part of investigations of health care fraud, false statements and other possible wrongdoing.
And in a statement last week, the White House celebrated decisions to end gender-affirming care, which it called a “barbaric, pseudoscientific practice”
Families worry about accessing care
Kristen Salvatore’s 15-year-old child started hormone therapy late last year at Penn State Health. Salvatore said in an interview with The Associated Press before the lawsuit was announced that it was a major factor in reduced signs of anxiety and depression. Last month, the family received official notice from the health system that it would no longer offer the hormones for patients under 19 after July 31, though talk therapy can continue.
Salvatore has been struggling to find a place that’s not hours away from their Mechanicsburg, Pa., home that would provide the hormones and accept Medicaid coverage.
“I’m walking around blind with no guidance, and whatever breadcrumbs I was given are to a dead-end alleyway,” she said.
The family has enough testosterone stockpiled to last until January. But if they can’t find a new provider by then, Salvatore’s child could risk detransitioning, she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yale-new-haven-hospital-3-e1608677205753.jpg,,,2025-08-01 14:56:52.139248

Mike Braun, flanked by Indiana State Police personnel, holds a news conference in his Statehouse office on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A trio of Indiana agencies have signed up for federal immigration enforcement powers, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun announced Friday.
“Indiana is not a safe haven for illegal immigration,” Braun said in a news release. “Indiana will fully partner with federal immigration authorities as they enforce the most fundamental laws of our country.”
If U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement approves the agreements, the Indiana State Police, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Correction would join four local Hoosier agencies — and nearly 900 others from across the nation — that have inked similar deals.
The formal partnerships are authorized in Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and let ICE delegate certain immigration enforcement powers to state or local officers.
There are three active program models: task force, warrant service officer and jail enforcement.
The Indiana State Police has submitted a memorandum of agreement for the task force model, according to an ICE list of pending deals that was updated Friday morning. So did the Department of Homeland Security.
Indiana immigration arrests surge despite stalled ICE partnerships

The Department of Correction asked for a warrant service officer deal. The agency is “working with ICE to make available up to 1,000 beds at Miami Correctional Facility,” the news release said.
The announcement follows an executive order Braun issued in January directing Hoosier law enforcement agencies to “fully cooperate with ICE, and, to the maximum extent permitted, enter into (287(g)) agreements.”
If ICE approves the deals, the agencies will be moved to a separate list of enacted deals. But that doesn’t mean they’re active.
The agencies will nominate specific personnel to take on federal powers. However, the officer nominees must undergo ICE training and pass examinations to be deputized.
Nominees from at least two of the four local Indiana agencies that have finalized 287(g) agreements with ICE still have not been trained — and therefore, haven’t been tapped in the national deportation effort, the Capital Chronicle found.
Braun is “also anticipating further partnership” between the Indiana National Guard and federal immigration authorities, it continued. That will not be a 287(g) agreement, according to the Braun administration.
Camp Atterbury — a federally owned military installation that is licensed to and operated by the guard — will be used to hold immigrant detainees.
It will be “available for temporary use by the (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security to house illegal aliens subject to deportation, with safety in mind for staff, detainees, and surrounding communities,” the news release said.
The plan was revealed last month in a letter from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to congressional members.

It took less than a month for scams to develop targeting those victims.
RECA — created in 1990 to provide restitution to people sickened by exposure to radiation and uranium — excluded New Mexico’s downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners, expired last year after years of lobbying for expansion by victims and New Mexico’s elected leaders.
But President Donald Trump signed a two-year expansion and extension into law earlier this month as part of Republicans so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
‘The beginning of justice’

On Tuesday, both the New Mexico Department of Justice and the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium issued a warning that RECA scams have already developed. According to an NMDOJ news release, “organizations and attorneys are soliciting people to file claims with them for a fee, despite the fact that New Mexico will have a legitimate claim submission process and guidance forthcoming.”
The U.S. Department of Justice has not yet announced an official claims process for qualifying New Mexicans. Both U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) last week recently sent letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer urging them to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short two-year timeline for compensation.
“We are grateful to our Congressional Delegation who tirelessly advocated for the expansion of these critical compensation efforts,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “New Mexicans who have been affected by these exposures deserve compensation — and they deserve to get that compensation free from bad actors attempting to take advantage of them. We encourage New Mexicans to file claims through legitimate entities to ensure they receive the maximum compensation they are entitled to through RECA, and also to file any reports of suspected fraudulent activity with our office.”
The news release notes that any entity that files a RECA claim on behalf of residents will charge a fee, which is capped at 2% by law, but can increase to 10% if that claim is rejected. Moreover, the state will have official RECA clinics to assist people.
The Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium said it will have official updates online.
“The people of New Mexico have waited 80 years for acknowledgement of the harm they suffered as a result of being overexposed to radiation from the Trinity bomb,” TBDC co-founder Tina Cordova said in a statement. “We hope everyone will be patient a little longer as details of the claim process are developed. Please don’t allow someone to take part of your claim out of fear or some sense of urgency. We will do all we can to assist with the claims process once the guidelines are released.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 17:22:43+00:00,CT Mirror,CT agrees to borrow $155 million to offset cost of electric bills,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/ct-public-benefits-charge-electric-billslls/,The CT Bond Commission voted to borrow $155M to help offset the cost of electric bills by paying off a portion of the public benefits charge.,"The State Bond Commission on Friday agreed to borrow $155 million to help offset the cost of residents’ electric bills, at least partially delivering on a promise of savings made by lawmakers during the most recent legislative session.
The bonds were issued to pay off a portion of the public benefits charge, which is used to fund state-mandated programs that have become subject to intense scrutiny in the larger debate over Connecticut’s high cost of electricity. 
By borrowing money to pay for some of those programs, officials estimated customers could see an average of between $5 and $10 savings on their monthly electric bills starting in September, depending on usage and which utility customers get their electricity from.
The commission, which is led by Gov. Ned Lamont, voted unanimously to approve the borrowing at its Friday meeting. 
“I know how upset everybody is with electric rates,” Lamont told reporters afterward. “We didn’t make a big difference, but we made a difference… at least by reduced rates. I can’t promise you what your bill is going to do, it depends what you do with the air conditioner.”
The authorization to borrow money to provide direct relief to ratepayers came from Senate Bill 4, the omnibus energy savings legislation that lawmakers spent months crafting earlier this year. Lamont signed the bill after it passed both chambers with bipartisan support in early June.
The initial estimates from proponents of that bill were that it would save customers in Connecticut between $325 million and $350 million annually off of their electric bills — or about $100 a year for the typical customer.
The bulk of that savings, at least initially, is expected to come from the state bonds. 
The initial tranche of borrowing approved by the Bond Commission on Friday included $125 million to pay off unpaid bills that accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with $30 million to cover the costs associated with the state’s electric vehicle charging program. Both costs were previously included as part of the public benefits charge.
An additional round of borrowing is expected next year, according to Lamont’s office. If approved, the associated savings will last through early 2027.
During the negotiations over S.B. 4, Republicans pushed for an even bigger package of savings by removing the public benefits charge altogether from customers’ bills, and instead paying for those programs through the state budget.
While that could have resulted in savings of up to 20% off customers’ bill, the cost — estimated at around $1 billion annually — proved to be unpalatable for Democrats, including Gov. Lamont, who argued they would have had to cut spending in other areas.
 Still, some Republicans on Friday bemoaned the level of savings even as they joined with Democrats to approve the bonds. 
“It doesn’t go far enough,” said Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, who is a member of the Bond Commission. “It’s a good first start, I think I credit both sides of the aisle for negotiating the bill, but Republicans have been calling for reducing that public benefits charge even further and getting a lot of those items into the general fund, where we can debate them, have a public hearing and we can vote on them.”
The savings attached to the bonds come on top of earlier rate relief that most customers already experienced in July as a result of a drop in standard supply rates at both of the state’s largest utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating. In May, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority also approved rate adjustments lowering the public benefits charge portion of customers’ bills. 
“There’s stuff that’s happening organically anyways, and then there’s stuff happening as a result of our bill getting passed,” said Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who was one of the principal authors of S.B. 4.
“Hopefully, this piece hits in September and brings the bill down more,” he added.  
In addition to public borrowing, S.B. 4 also authorized utilities to securitize their storm costs and the rollout of advanced metering technology. Those bonds, which were not a part of the Bond Commission’s agenda on Friday, will be paid back by utility customers through the public benefits charge, but over a longer period of time and at lower interest rates than under the current law.
In its other business Friday, the bond commission approved:

Nearly $1.6 billion in transportation bonding to finance a wide array of upgrades to Connecticut’s aging network of highways, bridges and rail lines. Two of the largest initiatives involve $157.5 million to replace the Norwalk River Rail Bridge, a four-track span that serves the Metro-North commuter line and Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor lines, and $50 million for continued rehabilitation of the Gold Star Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 95 across the Thames River between New London and Groton.
$40 million to cover the first half of the $80 million Town Aid Road grant due to Connecticut municipalities this fiscal year. Communities use those funds to cover repaving, drainage work and other routine road maintenance and to purchase sand, salt and other materials to support winter snow removal. The state is expected to deliver the remaining $40 million due cities and towns after Jan. 1.

Donavan McKinney, Macomb County Commissioner Michael Howard, and State Rep. Mai Xiong. July 31, 2025 | Photo courtesy of Michigan Families for Fair CareMichigan residents living in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts had choice words for Republican U.S. Reps. Tom Barrett and John James during two townhalls held this week focused on the impact of federal Medicaid cuts – but neither of the congressmen were there to hear them.
Michigan Families for Fair Care, a left-of-center nonprofit dedicated to highlighting the voting records of the representatives, hosted the rallies in Lansing and Warren on Wednesday and Thursday evening. Each event targeted Barrett’s and James’ districts with attendance from Democratic Party activists, community members and those running for office against them on the Democratic sides of the races.
The future of health care and food assistance following federal cuts in the Republican “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” were among the primary concerns at both town halls. The cuts are expected to impact hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, including $6 billion to hospitals in Michigan’s Medicaid program and the 1.5 million people who are likely to be affected by cuts to Michigan’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
More than 2.6 million Michiganders rely on Medicaid access for affordable health care.
In Warren on Thursday, the panel included Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, state Rep. Mai Xiong of Warren and state Rep. Donavan McKinney of Detroit. Gilchrist is seeking the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for governor in 2026, while McKinney is seeking to primary U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar of Detroit, a Democrat who currently represents the 13th Congressional District. Macomb County Commissioner Michael Howard, also a Democrat, was on the panel as well.
Gilchrist that it was up to community members to stand up when their elected officials don’t show up for them. To that end, he said that James was absent from the community he served, and was more interested in running “to Washington to vote for this bill that guts Medicaid.”
“Do you know that 182,000 in this district are living with Medicaid? That there are 41,000 veterans in the state of Michigan who are getting services from Medicaid?” Gilchrist asked the crowd, and by proxy an absent James. “These are the people he voted to strip and rip health care from. These are the people who he has voted to kill faster than they otherwise would have passed away. His absent leadership is dangerous.”
McKinney said that the community he serves and is seeking to serve in Congress has a medium income of $13,000 a year. With multiple children, McKinney said he also struggles balancing child care and other vital expenses to keep his family healthy and secure, and that was on a state representative’s salary. He said that someone earning less than $14,000 a year, which equates to about just $1,000 a month in take home pay, would face even greater hardships now that programs like Medicaid and SNAP are being slashed at the federal level.
“They do not need elected officials to cut one single resource, but that’s what this man, so-called Congressman John James, just did,” McKinney said, before adding that the congressmen on either side of 8 Mile Road at the border of Wayne and Macomb counties were absent from their districts, referring to James and Thanedar.
For Xiong, everything happening at the federal level is now touching all of her constituents’ lives.
“No matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat or independent,” Xiong said. “What’s happening at the federal level is hurting so many families. It’s devastating. We’re in unprecedented times. In all my 40 years that I’ve been alive, I don’t think that we’ve ever faced as many obstacles as we have this year.”
The trio took questions throughout the night on the state of Medicaid and SNAP in the fallout of the bill, and on the ways Democrats could strategize in order to talk about the cuts with their friends and neighbors, including Republicans who might be feeling buyers remorse.
One question focused on James’ joining the Republican stated goal of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse and using that as a guise to finally cut areas of the federal budget that GOP hawks have salivated over ripping apart for decades.
Gilchrist said what they’re actually going after is people’s ability to live and thrive.
“When they say they want to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and then the action they take is getting rid of services and health care and food assistance, it means they think that the people are the waste,” Gilchrist said. “So maybe they weren’t lying when they said they want to get rid of waste, because instead, they are harming and killing, in this case, the people in the state of Michigan. … It’s inhumane. It’s cruel.”
He noted that was the major difference between Republicans and Democrats in the modern age. Gilchrist also touched on the billion-dollar Michigan budget hole that will be created in the fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s cuts and provisions.
“That’s something John James did to us on purpose,” Gilchrist said. “It wasn’t an accident. It was intentional. What we have to do [now] is triage. How do we take care of the pregnant women who are more likely to die because their health care just got cut? … We need to be a little more creative.”
With those new holes in the budget and the current stalemate over the process going nowhere between the Republican-controlled Michigan House and the Democratic-led state Senate, McKinney said it could be possible that Michigan’s government shuts down on Oct. 1. He also said he believes that’s what the Republicans in the House want.
“We’re fighting like hell to figure it out, but these Republicans are playing hardball,” McKinney said. “They really don’t care. Whatever Trump is doing, they’re just following the federal protocol in D.C.”
Byrum leads panel in Lansing
The Lansing event featured Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for secretary of state, state Rep. Kara Hope of Holt and Ingham County Commissioner Ryan Sebolt.
Like the panel in Macomb County on Thursday, Byrum on Wednesday said that it was up to constituents to fight for their needs and resources when their elected leaders don’t show up for them, noting that Barrett has avoided town halls just like the ones held this week.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte). Not pictured: Tom Barrett. July 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance
She also counseled those in attendance to reach out to their friends and neighbors to explain how these cuts will affect their lives, but cautioned to do it with empathy, deep listening and to avoid saying, “I told you so.”
“Be reflective,” Byrum said. “I think if we have those conversations, I think that will also help. It’s imperative, and it’s so fitting that we’re sitting in the AFL-CIO building, that we remember that we are stronger together. We need to lean on each other.”
Although no candidate who might face Barrett was on the panel, several of his Democratic challengers were in the audience, including Michigan State University professor Josh Cowen, former NAVY Seal Matt Maasdam and Elyon Badger.

New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.

It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.

Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

Collins likened strip-searching, which he first experienced at age 13, to sexual assault, and said it was traumatizing. Collins, who is now 40, said the aftereffects are something he still deals with through therapy, even after having been released from DOC custody seven months ago. 
On Friday, the State Bond Commission approved funding for four body scanners as part of a pilot program with the aim of ending strip searches in the state’s prison facilities. 
State lawmakers have been discussing the purchase of body scanners for correctional facilities since at least 2023, when they asked Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros to study the cost of implementing the scanners at each of the prisons.
Quiros told lawmakers in a March meeting that the cost of installing 26 body scanners for visiting rooms and intake units would cost about $4 million. An additional 15 for the lobby areas, plus 12 more for the Restrictive Housing Units, or solitary confinement, brings the cost up to $8.1 million. 
Earlier this session, lawmakers brought forward a bill that would have put aside $500,000 to purchase at least two body scanners for York Correctional Institution, which houses the state’s women, and Manson Youth Institution. The bill passed out of the Government Oversight Committee and the Finance Committee with bipartisan support, but never made it to a vote on the floor. 
The funding approved by the bond commission Friday will be used for scanners at the two facilities as part of a larger capital funds package instead. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, told CT Mirror that he believed the body scanners provided a more humane alternative to strip searches, which he called “dehumanizing” and “degrading,” particularly for women. He said the idea that the Department of Correction was doing hundreds of thousands of strip searches in a year “seems excessive.” 
“When you have the ability to do something different, which we do, we should avail ourselves of that,” he said. 
Advocates have been decrying the use of strip searches for years. In February, advocates reiterated their call at a press conference memorializing the 2018 death of J’Allen Jones, who died after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as nine correction workers. Jones had refused to submit to a strip search. 
Data showed that the department conducted about 355,000 strip searches on incarcerated people in 2024.
In meetings with the legislature’s budget committee in February and March, Quiros said he believed the body scanners were “100% better” than strip searches at identifying contraband. He said he supported the use of body scanners for department staff as well as the incarcerated population.
But Rudy Demiraj, a corrections officer and representative for the Cheshire Correctional Complex Employees AFSCME Local 387, the local union, said he wasn’t sure that body scanners would be as efficient in picking up contraband coming into the prison as strip searches. 
“ The officers are highly trained on how to conduct these strip searches, what it is they’re actually targeting and looking for,” said Demiraj. “And I don’t know of any technology with scanners that could detect or pick up every type of contraband that could potentially be picked up through a strip search.”
Demiraj said he understood that while some inmates might feel the strip searches were degrading, they were necessary for the security of the facility. 
And Demiraj said that the corrections officers union did not support having staff go through the body scanners. He said the majority of contraband came into the facility during social visits or through the mail, and not from corrections officers. 
Barbara Fair, the executive director of Stop Solitary, told CT Mirror that she doesn’t have a lot of faith that the body scanners will be installed. She also said having the body scanners would not be a big victory unless there was a requirement that staff, and not just incarcerated individuals or visitors, also had to pass through the scanners to enter the facilities. 
“I’m just really discouraged,” she said. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, a top Republican on the state’s Judiciary Committee, called the promise for four scanners “a start, but a weak one.” He told CT Mirror in an email that if the state was really committed to the safety of the incarcerated and the corrections officers, it would invest in scanners in prisons other than the women’s prison and the juvenile prison. 
“We do see possession of contraband in our prisons, whether it be weapons or drugs, and they are getting in there somehow. One way to address this is through the use of these machines — an initiative that is supported by both the incarcerated as well as those in charge of them,” he said. 
Winfield said he knew the state wasn’t going to be able to purchase all the body cameras at once. He said that once the scanners were placed in the prisons, and the benefits became obvious, he didn’t see how the state wouldn’t continue installing scanners in other facilities.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-08-01 12:56:38.344718

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)AGENCY VILLAGE — If a Sisseton police officer gets punched on state land in Sisseton, Roberts County State’s Attorney Dylan Kirchmeier can charge the assailant with a felony for assaulting a police officer.
If that assailant also punches a tribal police officer who’s there to assist, Kirchmeier doesn’t have that option.
South Dakota law doesn’t include tribal police in its definition of a law enforcement officer, Kirchmeier told members of the State-Tribal Relations Committee on Thursday. But in Roberts County, tribal police work alongside sheriff’s deputies and city officers on a regular basis, sometimes as backup, sometimes as first responders when they’re closer to the scene when a call comes in. 
“I feel like that is doing a disservice to the tribal officers, because they’re doing the same job that any state law enforcement officer is,” Kirchmeier said. “It’s a bad loophole.”

Roberts County includes parts of the Lake Traverse Reservation, where the Sisseton-Wahpeton Police Department and tribal courts have jurisdiction. But the checkerboard nature of tribal land – one side of the road can be tribal, the other state – means that policing agencies wind up interwoven, for the safety of their officers and residents alike.
It’s not uncommon for suspects to cross tribal and state lines in the course of committing a crime, Kirchmeier said, particularly in vehicle pursuits.
Gary Gaikowski, the tribal police captain for the past 20 years and a longtime member of South Dakota’s Law Enforcement Standards and Training Commission, said the working relationships benefit both sides and public safety. 
“Everything that affects the state, Roberts County, the city of Sisseton, affects us,” Gaikowski told the committee. “And most of the time, it’s the same individuals that we’re arresting.”
That should move the Legislature to change the law to recognize tribal officers as law enforcement. 
“It does kind of, excuse my language, suck, to not be recognized as law enforcement officers,” he said.
Both men urged the committee to explore changes to the law to protect tribal police who aid their stateside counterparts.
Mutual aid agreements: Thorny territory
Gaikowski said he understands the thorny nature of cooperation between tribes and outside law enforcement. Attempts to push for more formal mutual aid agreements have met political resistance at the tribal council level, he told the committee.
Algin Young, South Dakota’s secretary of tribal affairs, told the committee he faced some of the same resistance during his stint as chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Police Department in Pine Ridge. 
Tribal governments don’t want state officials arresting their citizens, Young said, but might nonetheless see value in outside help. Working with the tribe and Pennington County eventually led to a setup in 2022 that opened the door to mutual aid between the county and the tribe, Young said, without giving the county the power to enforce state law on tribal land.
That should be the model for a state agency like the Highway Patrol, Young said.

“We have to be sensitive to what the tribes want,” he said. “We’ll go when they want, and we’ll leave when they ask us to.”
Bob Perry, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, told the lawmakers on the State-Tribal Relations Committee that the state is working with tribes to convince them to allow more agreements like that. He recently traveled to the Yankton Sioux Tribe to meet with leadership on the possibility of agreements with the Highway Patrol. 
The state’s closest formal partnership is with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, which uses state troopers for law enforcement only during its annual powwow, but Perry said there are other signs of progress on public safety cooperation.
There’s currently a Highway Patrol saturation operation taking place on the Standing Rock Reservation. Highway Patrol captains meet quarterly with officials on that reservation, and on the Cheyenne River Reservation.
“All law enforcement understands this is a good, good thing,” Perry said of mutual aid. “But there’s still some mistrust in the tribal communities that we have to overcome.”
Possible model: Missing people and violent crime
Perry pointed out that the Highway Patrol does accident reconstruction in fatal crashes on tribal land, and it doesn’t hesitate to put helicopters in the air if a child goes missing on tribal lands and tribal officials reach out for help.
Mark Van Norman, a special counsel for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, told the committee that the prevalence of missing and murdered Indigenous people and the widespread hunger to address the issue among tribal governments could serve as a  building block for trust. 
President Donald Trump signed an executive order to address the MMIP issue, Van Norman pointed out, so there’s a willingness at the federal level to improve cooperation. 
“We’ve been thinking that when we have missing people, that we would like to get an immediate response so that we can try and rescue the people within 72 hours,” Van Norman said.

Agreements for mutual aid in missing people cases could naturally extend, Van Norman said, to cooperation on cases involving violent crime. 
Concerns about jurisdictional challenges aren’t especially pronounced for Gaikowski, Kirchmeier and Roberts County Sheriff Tyler Appel, the sheriff said. Appel’s jail holds adult and juvenile inmates for the tribe, he said, and major cases like homicides are all-hands-on-deck situations.
“Perceptions from community members tend to be more of a challenge than us working together,” Appel said. “Captain Gaikowski’s department and I work very well together. Gary and I share phone calls and text messages on a pretty frequent basis.”
Pierre Republican Rep. Will Mortenson, the committee’s chair, said he was encouraged to hear that, and said he hopes the state can make more progress in allowing police to help each other across tribal lines.
“It seems like what we need is for the politicians to have the trust in law enforcement that law enforcement has in each other,” said Mortenson, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. “The more I think about this issue, the more I think we’ve got a politician problem, not a law enforcement problem.”
After the meeting, Mortenson said his comments were a reference to politicians “on any side” who might monkeywrench mutual aid. 
The committee’s next meeting will take place in mid-September, he said, and will be hosted jointly by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana political candidates and campaigns can post signs at public school athletic fields and gymnasiums starting Friday after being prohibited from doing so.

Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers carved out the school athletic facility exception from a more sweeping ban on political signs on government property in state law. 

Act 89, sponsored by Sen. Eddie Lambert, R-Gonzales, will allow the signage so long as it complies with local school board policies. 
If the school is used as a voting site, rules against political advertising during an election will still apply. Any area within 600 feet of a voting booth area becomes a campaign-free zone.

“In that case, a sign would have to be taken down during a political election,” Lambert said. 
Lambert offered the proposal in response to a letter Attorney General Liz Murrill’s office sent to high schools in his district last year telling them to take down political signs on display. It cost the school’s athletic programs a lot of money in refunds when the signs came down, he said. 

The president of the St. Amant High School athletic boosters, James LeBlanc, said his school lost $20,000. Before the letter from the attorney general, the athletic boosters had been selling advertising space to politicians for 25 years, he said during a hearing on the bill earlier this year.

Lambert said he spends between $3,000 and $5,000 on high school signs every year from his campaign account. 
“It came as a shock to me and the school systems in Ascension Parish” when the political signs were taken down, Lambert said. 

The proposal overwhelmingly passed the Legislature with a 38-0 vote in the Senate and 92-1 in the House of Representatives. State Rep. Beryl Amedee, R-Gray, was the only lawmaker to vote against the bill.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 12:56:38.344718

WILMINGTON— The Wilmington Fire Department graduated its largest-ever recruit class on Friday, with 36 new Firefighter/EMTs officially joining the ranks during a ceremony at the Chase Bank Conference Center.
The graduates of the department’s 44th Recruit Academy were celebrated by family, friends, city officials, and fire department leadership for completing 14 weeks of intensive training. Their addition brings the department’s authorized strength to 186, supporting Wilmington’s recently expanded emergency services that now include primary 911 ambulance response.
“I’m proud to welcome this outstanding class of Wilmington Firefighters to public service,” said Mayor John Carney. 
“This is the largest group ever hired by the Wilmington Fire Department, and their commitment reflects the strength and spirit of our city. These men and women have trained with focus and discipline, and they’re ready to serve with courage, compassion, and professionalism. Our residents will be safer because of the work they’ve put in, and because of the work they will do every day moving forward.”
The 14-week academy began May 2, 2025, and included a six-week National Emergency Medical Technician course and eight weeks of National Firefighter I & II curriculum, combining classroom instruction with hands-on training.
“We are honored to welcome this historic class into the Wilmington Fire Department,” said Fire Chief John Looney. 
“Their dedication and commitment have been evident from day one. These men and women have successfully completed an extremely rigorous training program and are now prepared to protect life and property throughout our city. We look forward to the leadership and service they will bring to every emergency they respond to.”

(Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.










It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.

After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

The pipeline, called the “Mississippi Crossing Project,” would start in Greenville, cross through Humphreys, Holmes, Attala, Leake, Neshoba, Newton, Lauderdale and Clarke counties and end near Butler, Alabama, stretching a total of nearly 208 miles.
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, sent an application for the project to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on June 30. The company hopes the pipeline, which would transfer up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, will address a rising energy demand by increasing its transportation capacity.

Kinder Morgan says on its website that, should it receive approval, construction would begin at the end of 2027 and the pipeline would begin service in November, 2028. The company says the project would cost $1.7 billion and create 750 temporary jobs as well as 15 permanent positions.
As shown in the map above, the project would also include new compressor stations in Humphreys, Attala and Lauderdale counties, although exact locations haven’t been set.
Singleton Schreiber, a national law firm that focuses on environmental justice, is looking to spread awareness of the public’s ability to participate in the approval process, whether or not they support the proposal.  
“We’re just trying to raise awareness to make sure that people know this is happening,” said Laura Singleton, an attorney with the firm. “They’re going to have to dig and construct new pipelines, so it’s going to pass through sensitive ecosystems like wetlands, private property, farmland, things like that. So you can have issues that come up like soil degradation, water contamination, and then after the pipeline is built you could potentially have leaks, spills.”
Singleton added while such issues with pipelines are rare, when “things go bad, they go pretty bad.” 
To comment, protest, or file a motion to intervene, the public can go to FERC’s website (new users have to create an account, and then use the docket number “CP25-514-000”). The exact deadline is 4 p.m. on Aug. 5. More instructions can also be found here.
In addition to FERC, the proposal will also face review from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and the state environmental agencies in Mississippi and Alabama. 
Mississippians have seen multiple incidents related to gas leaks in recent years. In March, three workers were injured after accidentally rupturing an Atmos Energy pipeline doing routine maintenance in Lee County, leaving thousands without service. Then last year, the National Transportation Safety Board found that Atmos discovered gas leaks over a month prior to two explosions in Jackson, one of which claimed the life of an 82-year-old woman.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01090732/MSX-12-19-24.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved Evergy’s request to build three natural gas plants and two solar farms, freeing the company to move forward with infrastructure projects that will cost more than $2.75 billion.
The four-member Missouri Public Service Commission board approved the facilities after hearing presentations about the facilities two weeks ago and despite worries about investing in solar energy.
“Personally, the solar case is concerning,” said MPSC chairwoman Kayla Hahn. “I recognize that we need more generation, and in particular, Evergy West needs more generation. However, intermittent resources such as solar as standalone projects seem to make little sense and may not be the best choice in terms of resource planning and the best use of ratepayer dollars.”
Hahn said her concerns were pertinent in light of federal changes to green energy tax credits, among other issues. The state faces conflicting issues with the need to build replacement and additional generation and the need to keep rates affordable, she said. 
“It’s increasingly important that a critical view is taken of any request for new generation,” Hahn said. “Because we are in a situation where the need for additional generation for Evergy West, who has been and continues to be short on its own generation, is so great, I’m not going to stand in the way of allowing more generation resources to be added.” 
Evergy announced last year its intent to build the gas plants — two in Kansas and one in Missouri — and the solar plants, one in each state. The company sought pre-approval for the projects through Kansas and Missouri regulators. 
They received approval from the Kansas Corporation Commission in early July. 
Evergy Missouri West, the Evergy subsidiary serving Missouri customers, and Evergy Kansas Central, which serves Kansas customers, will own 50% each of the two Kansas gas plants. The two 710-megawatt facilities, located in Sumner and Reno counties, are expected to cost $788.75 million and $800.52 million, respectively. 
Evergy Missouri West will own 100% of a 440-megawatt natural gas facility in Nodaway County, Missouri, with a price tag of $835 million. It will also own Foxtrot Solar Energy, a 107 megawatt solar farm in Jasper County, Missouri, estimated to cost $213.8 million.
Evergy Kansas Central will own 100% of a 75-megawatt solar farm, Sunflower Sky Solar Project, in Wilson County, Kansas, estimated to cost $128.8 million.  
Darrin Ives, Evergy vice president of regulatory affairs, told MPSC commissioners Thursday there had been “a lot of movement” about tax credits and tariffs at the federal level.
“At this stage, we still need some information from the Treasury,” he said. “But by and large, with the budget reconciliation bill, they’ve set up a path and a plan that, while it’s scaled back significantly the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) subsidies around carbon-free generation, it has left a pathway for these projects.
Ives said there’s also a pathway to complete the project by the end of 2027 and still qualify for tax credits. Ives said the issues were part of settlement discussions, and Evergy will be required to give updates on any changes with tax credit availability, among other reporting requirements.
In a press release after the MPSC decision Thursday, the Sierra Club said it opposed Evergy’s proposal. The nonprofit intervened in the MPSC case. 
“No party, except Evergy, argued that the gas plant proposals are economically feasible, a critical factor in the MIssouri approval process,” the release said.  
““If Evergy’s application is approved as submitted, Missouri ratepayers will be on the hook for gas plants that are likely to be unprofitable, operate less than expected and incur high maintenance costs or even premature failure due to excessive generator starts and cycling,” testified Michael Goggin, a Sierra Club expert witness, before MPSC. 
Billy Davies, Sierra Club’s Missouri chapter organizer based in Kansas City, said in the press release that Evergy shareholders, rather than ratepayers, should shoulder the costs of generation expansion. 
“Sadly, the PSC is enabling utilities and multi-billion dollar tech companies to use average Missouri families as piggy banks to power new data centers,” Davies said. “The last hope for the commission to protect Missouri families from utility bill shock is to have a strong large user fee that ensures multi-billion dollar tech companies pay their fair share of these new power plants being built in the name of their data centers.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said the company was pleased the MPSC approved the plants. 
“Current construction schedules should allow the solar plants to benefit from federal tax credits, and those benefits will be passed to customers served by the plants,” she said. 
Tariff levels are changing frequently, so it is difficult to quantify their effect on the projects, she said. 
“If they stay in place over a long term, the cost of capital projects like new generation would increase,” Penzig said. “As we negotiate contracts with suppliers, we are always focused on keeping our costs low because that impacts our customers’ rates. Some aspects of the new generation projects are already under contract.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090642-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

ChristianaCare is set to open its first neighborhood hospital in its 188-year history this month, bringing around-the-clock emergency and acute care directly to southern Chester County. 
ChristianaCare Hospital, West Grove, located at 1015 West Baltimore Pike, will officially open following final inspection by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, expected in the first week of August.
The 20,000-square-foot facility marks a milestone for ChristianaCare, which partnered with Emerus Holdings, Inc. to develop the new hospital. The site will operate 24/7 and be staffed by board-certified emergency physicians, nurses, and clinical specialists providing patient-first care.

“It’s an honor and privilege to expand access to high-quality care for our neighbors in southern Chester County,” said Janice Nevin, M.D., MPH, president and CEO of ChristianaCare.
“We will be opening our doors for the families in this community with a steadfast commitment to being their trusted health care partner. We’re grateful for the opportunity to bring love and excellence to those we will serve.”
The hospital features a full-service emergency department with 10 treatment rooms, a 10-bed inpatient unit, and advanced imaging and lab services such as ultrasound, CT scan, and X-ray.

Virtual access to specialty care in cardiology, critical care, and infectious disease will also be available. While equipped to handle emergencies like falls, strokes, and heart attacks, patients requiring more complex care will be stabilized and transferred elsewhere as needed.
“This neighborhood hospital brings the right mix of services to support the health and well-being of our neighbors,” said Pauline Corso, president of ambulatory network continuity and growth at ChristianaCare. 
“We’re excited to bring care close to home to meet the needs of the community. We’re here to stay and grow alongside this community.”

Local support, including grants from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Chester County Board of Commissioners, led by Josh Maxwell, Marian Moskowitz, and Eric Roe, helped lead the project. 
ChristianaCare has also purchased the building at 900 W. Baltimore Pike, directly across the street, which currently houses a primary care practice and imaging services. The facility offers walk-in X-rays and scheduled mammography and ultrasound appointments and is expected to expand its services over time.
The West Grove hospital is part of a broader regional strategy by ChristianaCare to address healthcare gaps in southeastern Pennsylvania. Neighborhood hospitals are also planned for Aston and Springfield Townships in Delaware County, with Aston projected to open in late 2026.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/West-Grove-_-Ribbon-Cutting-2048x1152-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program has officially ended and is canceling all grants from 2020 to 2023 that have not already been distributed. For Connecticut, only 22% of all BRIC projects have been funded. The rest will remain unfunded.
While some projects did not receive funding for other reasons before the grant program was cancelled, many of the more recent projects from 2023 are affected by the cancellation.
One of the projects confirmed to have been affected by the grant cancellation is the a coastal flood defense project in Bridgeport. This project was a part of the Resilient Bridgeport infrastructure initiative.
The Flood Mitigation Assistance program also has been removed from the 2025 grant cycle, halting new grant applications. As of now, the federal government has not made any announcement regarding funding of current projects.
Connecticut had 35 ongoing projects from 2020 to 2023 that were in various stages of receiving BRIC and FMA funding. Of these, 23 were projects funded under BRIC to address hazards ranging from flooding and severe storm impact to infrastructure failures. As of July 29, only $25.9 million of $120 million that was selected for federal grants had been obligated to the 35 BRIC and FMA projects.
Many federal funds are allocated under FEMA’s hazard mitigation assistance projects where spending and projects tend to peak following a natural disaster. Some BRIC and FMA grants fall under this category. 
While the BRIC grant was cancelled because it was “a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” according to a since-deleted press release from FEMA, many are concerned about what could happen without the federal funds.
“The FEMA funds, through BRIC and also through the hazard mitigation grant program, have been pretty critical at helping the towns do the legwork and the planning and design work and move these things forward,” said John Truscinski, the director for resilience planning at the Connecticut Institute for Resilience and Climate Adaptation. “And they do take a long time for a variety of reasons, and so cutting back on the commitment of funds after several years of work has gone into those projects, it has a big impact in setting things back for the state.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/of9eE-where-were-the-bric-grants-being-spent--1024x856.png,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

I write as a two-time graduate of Southeastern Louisiana University (Class of 2001 and 2005) to express my outrage and deep disappointment over the university’s treatment of Dr. Fereshteh Emami, as detailed in the Louisiana Illuminator.
Dr. Emami, who led a major research project on Lake Maurepas, was abruptly removed after exposing dangerous levels of toxic metals, including arsenic and lead. Her research identified serious environmental threats, yet instead of being supported by her institution, she was removed from the project, excluded from a documentary, and reassigned to teaching-only duties without explanation.
This is nothing short of shameful. Southeastern appears more concerned with protecting political and corporate interests than upholding scientific integrity or safeguarding public health. The university’s silence, complicity, or worse, its cooperation with those trying to bury this research, is a betrayal of its mission and of the public trust.
As an alumnus, I am ashamed of my university. The administration’s actions send a chilling message to all researchers: tell the truth, and you’ll be punished. That is not education. That is cowardice.
Southeastern must be held accountable — for Dr. Emami, for the truth, and for the people who deserve to know what’s in their water.

This such blatant corruption – and the fact that these Air Product corporate bullies and Southeastern evidently think we’re to stupid to see the connection of how their money connections to the university clearly strong-armed this decision – is an insult to educated people!
This blatant biased decision also clearly shows the intentions of this Air Products project is obviously not in the best interest of the environment, wildlife or people of Lake Maurepas or the surrounding waters! She needs to be reinstated as a researcher immediately.

The private membership association, called Return to the Land, owns 160 acres in northeast Arkansas, according to its website. Jews and non-whites are explicitly banned from membership.
The group’s leader recently said it is exploring the idea of expanding north and building a new enclave in the Springfield area.
“We have the God-given right to form communities according to whatever values we hold dear,” Eric Orwoll, co-founder of Return to the Land, said in a recent social media post, “and the government does not have the right to tell free American citizens what values they have to live according to in their own private lives.”
The idea of a segregated community coming to southwest Missouri was greeted with scorn by both Democratic and Republican legislative leaders from the area.
“Racism in any form is evil and reprehensible,” said House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican. “Groups engaging in racist conduct are not welcome in Springfield.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said history has been “very clear on what happens when you stay silent as groups discriminate based on race and discriminate based on whether or not someone is of the Jewish faith. I cannot believe that in 2025 we are retreading this ground.”
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said racial discrimination “has no place in Missouri.”
“Attorney General Bailey is committed to protecting the constitutional rights of all citizens,” the statement said. “The landmark Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer, which originated in St. Louis, made clear that government cannot enforce racially discriminatory housing practices, and Missouri will not tolerate efforts to revive them.”
The Springfield City Council and City Manager David Cameron issued a joint statement this week declaring that “there is no place in Springfield, or anywhere, for such a divisive and discriminatory vision.”
“While it is improbable that such a project could legally or practically occur within city limits, silence is not an option,” the statement said. “As a regional leader, we will not stand idly by in the face of attempts to revive outdated, harmful ideologies.”
On its website, Return to the Land its mission is to “separate ourselves from a failing modern society, and we will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities.”
It also includes a disclaimer that the group does not engage in the sale or rental of real estate.
Orwoll responded to criticism from Springfield elected officials in his social media post, denying that excluding people of color and Jews should be considered racist.
“We are not a hate group,” he said. “We have never expressed hate towards any ethnic group, racial group or religious group.”
He took umbrage with Fogle calling the group racist, saying: “She wants to call us racists because we prefer being among our own people.”
“It’s not a supremacist group. It’s not a hate group. It’s not even a white nationalist group,” he said. “We are white identitarians. We value our identity and want to preserve it. That’s not hate. That is love for your own people.”
Fogle, who was among the first public officials to condemn Return to the Land’s possible expansion to Missouri, said she has been inundated with “pretty horrific messages and pretty horrific responses” on social media.
But she said she has no intention of being silent.
“It’s my job to make sure I’m using my platform to communicate that there’s no place in Springfield, no place in Missouri, no place in this country for a group who is intentionally leaving behind people who have a different skin color or intentionally leaving behind people of the Jewish faith,” she said. “And I would expect every elected official at every level to use their platform to see the same things.”
Across the state line, the group also drew the ire of Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin.
The Republican announced his office would open an investigation of the group to ensure its activities didn’t violate state or federal law. That probe, Griffin said in an email to The Independent, has not turned up any illegal activity.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”

(Photo: Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.

“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, including Maine, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
Maine decreased its unfunded pension liability during that period by more than 20 percentage points, the Pew analysis found.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in the last legislative session supported a bill that would tie the state employee pension system to the Consumer Price Index to help retirement accounts keep pace with inflation. However, that bill didn’t end up passing before the Legislature adjourned in June because of a sizable fiscal note topping more than $1.6 billion. Lawmakers will have a chance to revisit it in the next session that starts in January.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019. In Maine, unfunded retiree health care liabilities decreased by nearly 7.5 percentage points.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 14:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"For some, Bridgeport scholarship helps open doors to higher ed",Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/university-bridgeport-brightest-scholarship-ct/,The Bridgeport’s Brightest scholarship reduces the cost of attending the University of Bridgeport for local students.,"For Chamique Brown, the road to college seemed like it’d be a tough one.
After emigrating from Jamaica during high school and spending her senior year at Warren Harding High School in Bridgeport, Brown found herself facing the same question many high school seniors do: What’s next?
But unlike many of her classmates, she didn’t qualify for federal financial aid at the time because of her visa status.
“I was trying really hard to go to college and was met with the disappointing news that I couldn’t go because I didn’t qualify for financial aid,” Brown said. “I was really bummed out at the time.”
With her dreams seemingly on hold, Brown started preparing to attend a local community college instead. But then came an unexpected call from the University of Bridgeport about Bridgeport’s Brightest — a new initiative launched in 2024 to provide local high school graduates with a fully funded path to higher education.
“I got a call from UB, and they said I would be eligible for the scholarship. At first, I didn’t believe it. I thought it was too good to be true,” Brown said with a laugh.
Brown had applied to UB earlier but wasn’t very optimistic because of the cost and how little she knew about the school. That call changed everything.
The program was created in partnership with Bridgeport Public Schools and in response to a growing crisis in college access. During the early years of the COVID pandemic, FAFSA completions in Connecticut dropped nearly 15% year-over-year, with low-income and first-generation students among the most affected.
The result? Dozens of students like Brown were left reconsidering whether college was even possible.
“This gave me another chance at life,” Brown said. “I was very demotivated at the time. I didn’t know what I wanted to become or what I wanted to do. This college was a big push to achieve something.”
Brown is now entering her sophomore year at UB as a mechanical engineering major. She is the first in her family to attend college.

The Bridgeport’s Brightest scholarship reduces the cost of attending the University of Bridgeport for local students. It offers a flat rate of $7,000 for commuters and $12,500 for residential students — a discount from the university’s standard tuition of $35,760 per year plus fees for full-time undergraduates before any financial aid or scholarships.
For students who also qualify for Pell Grants or Connecticut state aid, the scholarship often helps covers most, if not all, out-of-pocket costs. The program is renewable for up to four years and is capped at 50 students annually to ensure its long-term sustainability.
University of Bridgeport President Danielle Wilken said the program is part of the university’s broader mission to serve its home city.
“We are deeply committed to investing in our local community and fostering the next generation of lifelong learners,” Wilken said. “By partnering with Bridgeport Public Schools, we aim to provide more students with the resources and support they need to pursue higher education.”
She added, “This scholarship is not just an investment in individual futures, but in the future of our community as a whole.”
Since the program’s launch, Wilken said it has been met with overwhelming support from students, parents, and school counselors alike. “Even this year, our high school recruiters said the first question they got from students and families was, ‘Are you going to continue the program?'”
Although it’s too early to analyze long-term data, early trends are promising. Of the students in the first cohort, the majority are pursuing high-impact fields like engineering, nursing, and criminal justice.
For many students, the scholarship provides more than just financial support. It also offers a sense of belonging.
“This program allows students to experience a global university in their backyard,” said Allison Garris, dean of admissions. “They have access to varsity sports, on-campus living, research opportunities, and an international community, while still being supported by their local community and family.”
That proximity, Garris said, is especially important for students juggling work, caregiving, and other family responsibilities.
“When students are thinking about college, they’re wondering, ‘How could I go to class and still make dinner? How can I be here and still be the babysitter?'” she said. “Our job is to show them that it is possible.”
To that end, the university offers a wide array of wraparound services. Communications with families are translated into more than 50 languages. Students receive ongoing support through UB’s Student Support Services, scholarship coaching through a platform called Scholarship Universe, and consistent outreach through local guidance counselors.
“We’re not just handing off students,” Garris said. “We’re building a holistic support system that follows them through their entire educational journey.”
That support was vital for Brown.

“The Student Support Services has provided help since my first day and hasn’t stopped,” she said.
Brown said she also appreciates that UB is exploring ways to improve student access to transportation, especially for those commuting to campus.
“Transportation is important,” she said. “Sometimes public transit isn’t reliable, and that affects students’ ability to participate in clubs or events. I think if UB adds more support for that, it would help students get more involved.”
The scholarship was born in response to a nationwide FAFSA crisis, but university leaders say it reflects a deeper, ongoing need.
“Access to quality higher education ensures more underrepresented groups can succeed academically and professionally,” said Wilken. “It’s the key to realizing equity and breaking the cycles of generational poverty.”
Still, the program’s future depends heavily on donor support. While the university has already secured funding from a small group of local philanthropists, Wilken said sustaining and expanding the program will require long-term investment.
“If you want to invest in the city, and you’re not sure how, this is a great opportunity,” she said. “You’re investing in a student’s education, but the impact that has on the global community is much larger than that.”
Brown says she still has moments where she feels the pressure of being the first in her family to go to college, but she’s learning to take it one step at a time.
“I feel motivated, but I remind myself to be gentle,” she said. “This is part of my journey.”
In five years, she hopes to have a job in engineering, ideally in the structural or civil fields. Her ultimate goal is to help her mother with bills, earn her master’s degree, and give back to the family that encouraged her every step of the way.
“My mom always said, ‘Go to school, go to school.’ That’s it.”
“I really appreciate what everyone has done for me,” Brown adds. “It’s a really good thing to feel supported and to be given an opportunity that wasn’t available to me before.”

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
They include York’s WellSpan Park, Lancaster’s Penn Medicine Park, and Erie’s UPMC Park.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.

After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
Kansas v. Missouri stadium battle shows how states are reigniting border wars

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”

For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

“Indigenous designers and architects are so important to creating the future of our communities that we decided to find a way to introduce the profession to youth,” said Olbekson, the founder of Full Circle Indigenous Planning + Design.  
Olbekson created the camp with fellow architect Mike Laverdure to show Native youth that architecture can be an accessible career path. Seven junior high and high school students participated in its second year.

In a classroom on the third floor of the Dunwoody College of Technology, students showed off their final projects to their parents, wearing the name of the camp on laser-cut wooden medallions strung with brightly colored ribbons. It was the culmination of a week spent touring Indigenous architecture projects, learning about design concepts and building their own creations. 
Jessica Garcia Fritz, an assistant professor of architecture at the University of Minnesota, helped plan the curriculum — titled “At Home in the Homelands.” Students drew and modelled their own scale sleeping spaces with cardboard, combining them to form a communal space.

In a project called “Smudge Ring,” Garcia Fritz said, “individual spaces are talking to each other. And it allows for a certain sequence, movements. But it also has Indigenous iconography as well.” 
Olbekson said architecture is a vital way of communicating cultural identity. 
“It’s just underscoring the importance of Indigenous people designing for Indigenous communities. For too long, architecture and planning has been something that has been imposed on us, rather than coming from within. And so we have wonderful cultures, beautiful design, arts, histories that can all impact how we design for our communities,” Olbekson said. 
Olbekson has worked on projects like the Minneapolis American Indian Center and Wakan Tipi Center in St. Paul.

For now, the one-week camp is mostly limited to students in the Twin Cities area, but the organizers are seeking to include younger students, Indigenous nations and schools. For Garcia Fritz, a citizen of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the camp is about giving Indigenous kids the opportunities she didn’t have. 
“For many of us, we were the only Indigenous people in our architecture classes. And so this was a way to show that, yeah, there is a collective of Indigenous designers, and to make that something that’s much larger,” Garcia Fritz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NN250726_0062-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 10:58:13.889811

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Problems linger in a Kansas federal prison holding immigrant detainees, even after altering some practices that a coalition of lawyers, civil rights groups and advocates revealed were harmful to those inside.
The Federal Correction Institution at Leavenworth is one of two places in Kansas where Immigration and Customs Enforcement can detain people long term, and the coalition wrote to the prison warden in June about unsanitary, inequitable and unhealthy conditions. 
Warden Crystal Carter wrote in a June 20 response letter that the prison had eliminated medical fees, added law library resources that ICE failed to provide, implemented new recreation hours and expanded Spanish-language communications.
But concerns about lockdowns and adequate phone call time remain, said Kyle Virgien, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.
“We see a lot of problems across ICE’s detention network,” Virgien said. “Detention is difficult. It rips people from their communities. It isolates them from their families. This is a constant.”
Virgien began speaking with people inside Leavenworth in April and continues to monitor conditions.
What he heard was troubling, he said.
The coalition wrote in a pair of letters in May that detained immigrants faced unsanitary and crowded living quarters, extended lockdowns, delayed and costly medical treatment, restricted contact with their families, and no access to religious services.
Some had attempted suicide, the letter said.
Carter, the warden, said things have changed.
After reviewing its procedures, the prison eliminated a $2 fee that people in ICE custody were charged for certain health visits. Staff were told to stop those charges and reverse all previous ones. To boost access for medical services, the prison created request slips written in Spanish for ICE detainees, Carter said. However, it is unclear how quickly officials respond to Spanish medical requests. 
Carter said capacity concerns did not exist at the time of writing, and, according to the coalition, people inside have said what once were crowded cells have become less so. 
According to July data from ICE, estimating average daily populations from the past year, about 35 people are held daily in Leavenworth for immigration reasons. Most pose little to no threat, according to ICE threat level classifications. On average, around 21 people were associated with criminal cases, and 12 were not. All are male and stay an average of 25 days.
During those 25 days, people in ICE custody now are afforded at least one hour of outdoor recreation time daily and a maximum of 300 minutes of phone calls per month, with no call lasting longer than 15 minutes.
People in ICE custody at Leavenworth are subject to the rules and policies of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which oversees operations. Some of the rules and policies are a departure from typical conditions in ICE detention facilities, Virgien said.
He has heard stories of mistreatment from guards and retaliatory lockdowns that punish many for the actions of few, he said. Lockdowns mean people are in cells for 23 hours a day and must “pack all of their life tasks into that one hour outside the cell,” Virgien said, which can include recreation, showers, legal research, religious practices and phone calls.
Carter said one instance of a lockdown has occurred in Leavenworth’s ICE detention unit for 72 hours, and another more than eight hours.
“Except for the limited and infrequent instances, all ICE detainees have time outside of their cell each day and have access to exercise, the electronic law library and phone systems,” Carter said.
The people ICE detains in Leavenworth are imprisoned alongside people awaiting criminal trials or serving criminal sentences.
Benjamin O’Cone, a spokesman for the bureau, said in an emailed statement that it’s the mission of the bureau and Leavenworth to “operate facilities that are safe, secure and humane.”
“We take seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody, as well as maintaining the safety of our employees and the community,” O’Cone said. “Humane treatment of the men and women in our custody is a top priority.”
ICE did not respond to a request for comment. ICE also has not responded to the coalition’s letter, according to ACLU of Kansas spokeswoman Esmie Tseng.
Virgien said the coalition is glad the prison addressed some of the issues they raised, but concerns remain.
“Many of the people at the facility have already won their immigration cases, and ICE is still detaining them,” Virgien said.
The coalition believes ICE should release people as soon as their immigration cases are won.
In at least one case, an immigration judge determined a man could not return to his country of origin without risking torture. Others include people who have spoken out against authoritarian governments in their countries of origin or fled persecution. Some have young children. Many have come from Chicago, and a small number from Kentucky, Virgien said.
When asked about the possibility of pursuing legal action, Virgien said, “all options are on the table.”
Now, with major Congressional budget increases for ICE, Virgien fears problems will only multiply.
Congress approved more than $175 billion for ICE in its most recent budget bill, making it what the Brennan Center for Justice classified as the largest federal law enforcement agency. The funds expand ICE’s ability to bring people into custody while capping the number of immigration judges in the country.
Also in Leavenworth, private prison company CoreCivic is battling the city government to reopen a shuttered prison to use as its Midwest Regional Reception Center, which would detain as many as 1,000 people. A judge temporarily blocked the company in July from housing people at its facility until the matter is worked out in court.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/U.S.-Penitentiary-Leavenworth-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 10:58:13.889811

The New Mexico Department of Justice is part of 25 outstanding multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration over funding cuts, as well as alleged federal overreach in executive orders on election administration or stripping birthright citizenship.
Attorney General Raúl Torrez joined other Democratic attorneys general in March town hall in Phoenix, speaking to the litigation strategy a Democratic AG coalition has deployed against the Trump administration.

“Since January of 2025, much of the Impact Litigation Division’s work has focused on protecting the interests of the State of New Mexico and our residents against federal funding cuts and agency reorganizations that have or would have impaired our state government’s ability to serve our population,” Anjana Samant, deputy counsel for impact litigation at NMDOJ, told the New Mexico Legislature’s interim Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee.
Judges have granted temporary wins to the state, often restoring cut funds in several of the suits. This included $12 billion dollars in federal grants and loans already promised to New Mexico frozen by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; just over $50 million for the state’s education department across several different lawsuits; $59 million for pandemic-era public health funding stripped out of New Mexico Department of Health and Health Care Authority budgets; and $18 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation for electric vehicle infrastructure.

Samant noted that the division, beyond its lawsuits against the federal government, also pursued litigation against social media owners Meta and Snap Inc, which owns Snapchat alleging the company’s policies fail to protect children.
Samant requested lawmakers provide $3.2 million in additional funding in the 2026 session to hire more staff.“To say that we are at capacity is an understatement,” Samant said of the division’s five attorneys. “We want to continue to do the amazing work that we are doing, but we also want to expand our impact.”
Sen. William Soules (D-Las Cruces), the committee’s co-chair, said he supported that request.“For a few million dollars, you all with an office of four or five, have saved a several billion dollars — that seems like a pretty good deal,” Soules said. “And I hope that in the next budget that we’re able to make sure that there is that funding.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9541-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-01 09:59:32.350582

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska lawmakers are scheduled to meet at 10 a.m. in Juneau for a special session of the Alaska Legislature. You can watch live online on Gavel Alaska. 
Why is the Legislature meeting in a special session?
Gov. Mike Dunleavy called the special session. The official agenda says that it will involve legislation about education policy and a proposed Alaska Department of Agriculture.
Will legislators actually do that?
No.
What are they doing instead?
They’re going to vote on overriding at least some of the vetoes the governor has made since the regular legislative session ended in May. 
No. 1 on the list is the governor’s decision to veto about $51 million in funding for public schools. The No. 2 item is the bill that would require the Alaska Department of Revenue to provide lawmakers with additional information about tax settlements between oil companies and the state. Lawmakers believe the state may be settling tax disputes for far less than they’re worth, costing the state millions.
Some legislators are interested in taking up other vetoes as well, including the governor’s decision to cancel a ban on payday loan lending, his decision to veto money for transportation projects, and his vetoes of bills affecting police dogs and teacher housing, among others.
Will those overrides succeed?
It’s too close to call. The Alaska Constitution says votes from 45 of 60 legislators are needed to override a budget veto. In May, 46 legislators voted in favor of overriding the governor’s decision to veto a bill that increases the state’s public school funding formula. 
That was the first time since 2002 that legislators voted to override the veto of a sitting governor.
It isn’t clear whether everyone who voted in favor of that first override will vote in favor of the second. 
Overriding a policy bill veto, like the one dealing with the tax settlements, takes 40 votes.
Will everyone be there?
Probably not. Some conservative Republicans had said they would stay away from the session in a show of support for the governor’s vetoes. Immediately after calling the special session, Dunleavy asked them to be absent for the first five days because an absence is as good as a “no” vote when it comes to a veto override.
He later changed his position, asking lawmakers to begin meetings about his stated agenda on Sunday, and some Republicans changed course and said they will attend the session, after all. It wasn’t clear whether all have done so, but it isn’t likely to affect the vote total on the potential override.
Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is in favor of an override and had been expected to be unavailable because of military service overseas. He ended up getting a special leave of absence and is flying back from Europe. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, is flying back from Vietnam to attend. Other legislators have canceled family plans and postponed business trips.
How long will this take?
On the low end, a few hours. On the high end, a few days. Officially, the special session can last for up to 30 days, but legislators have said they won’t use all that time. 
In some previous special sessions, legislators have left Juneau without formally closing the special session, just in case they need to come back. Those special sessions ended after the 30th day.
How much will this special session cost?
Based on historical costs, the estimated cost for a special session is $30,000 per day, according to the Legislative Affairs Agency, the Legislature’s nonpartisan support agency. But that cost depends on the duration and scope of the special session, said Jessica Geary, the agency’s executive director, by email on Tuesday. 
“Many legislators had to change summer travel plans to attend the special session, and many of them purchase their own travel and submit for reimbursement. At this point we don’t have any concrete cost estimates and won’t know until the special session concludes,” she said.
Geary said legislators have up to 60 days to submit reimbursements for expenses like hotel lodging, transportation and airfare, staffing, expenses, and so the agency will have a total cost by October. 
Legislators receive an annual salary of $84,000 per year. The 57 members that live outside of Juneau are entitled to receive a “per diem” amount of $332 per day to cover expenses. 
If lawmakers don’t take up the governor’s ideas, are they dead?
No. Legislators have created a task force to consider education policy changes, including those from the governor. One idea supported by the governor is open enrollment — allowing a student to move between different schools and school districts, regardless of where they live. That will be considered by the task force, which meets Aug. 25.
Legislators are also considering a bill that would create the Alaska Department of Agriculture. That bill is broader than the governor’s initial plans; for example, it would include sea farms (formally known as aquaculture), which are the fastest-growing agricultural sector in Alaska.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
North Dakota bill takes aim at crypto fraud with new consumer protections

Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

Elissa Slotkin says she supported a pair of Senate resolutions aimed at cutting off arms sales to Israel despite missing both to appear on a late-night talk show.
Michigan’s junior Democratic senator issued a statement late Thursday following her absence from recent Senate votes regarding two Joint Resolutions of Disapproval aimed at blocking arms sales to Israel in reaction to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Slotkin’s trip to New York City Wednesday to appear on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” resulted in her missing eight Senate votes including the two sponsored by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont).SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I owe it to my state to make clear where I stand: Had I made it back for the vote yesterday, I would have voted yes to block offensive weapons to Israel based on my concerns over lack of food and medicine getting to civilians in Gaza,” Slotkin said in the statement.
While reiterating her strong support for Israel, she said “images of emaciated children are hard to turn away from,” and emphasized that the U.S. needed to hold the Israeli government accountable for its actions.
The United Nation’s Human Rights Council said those actions include a blockade of food, fuel and lifesaving aid, as well as the “systematic destruction of local food production,” that has left the Gaza Strip on the verge of famine.
“But it appears today that the Netanyahu government thinks that there are no limits to what they can do while still receiving U.S. support. And so, I believe a message has to be sent. Should similar votes on offensive weapons come up in the future, I will take them on a case-by-case basis, with the hope of important humanitarian course corrections,” Slotkin said.
Her statement follows a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, calling for the immediate opening of all checkpoints into Gaza.
Slotkin joins Muslim and Jewish leaders urging immediate humanitarian aid to save children in Gaza

Israel’s offensive in Gaza — launched in retaliation to the militant group Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel — has killed more than 60,000 people according to Gaza’s health ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government.
While both of the resolutions were voted down Wednesday in the Republican-led Senate, for the first time ever, a majority of Democrats in the upper chamber voted in favor of cutting off arms sales to Israel.
Slotkin finds herself caught in a political conundrum between progressive activists who have sharply criticized her ongoing support for Israel, accusing her of turning a blind eye to what they describe as a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, and centrist and pro-Israel elements pressuring her to more forcefully condemn rising antisemitism. 
While Slotkin’s efforts at navigating that divide have threatened her standing as a Democratic Party leader amidst a deeply polarized electorate, she said that her votes have not been driven by ideology, but instead based on the facts as they existed at the time.
“[O]ver these last two years, few issues have been as raw as this one. I have therefore worked very hard to call balls and strikes based on my experience and the facts on the ground, even as most people fall firmly into one side or another, and are often reluctant to consider new information,” Slotkin said in her statement.
She said that she felt compelled to issue the statement out of her “deep concern and conviction” for Israel’s long-term security,” and its right to demand the immediate release of all hostages, but that the Netanyahu government actions threaten to unravel the bipartisan consensus that has helped keep Israel safe.  
“No one leader should so significantly threaten the long-term security of the state of Israel. I urge the Trump Administration and the Israeli Prime Minister to get aid in as soon as possible and save lives,” Slotkin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222293549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 09:59:32.350582

California gun owners are eager to get their hands on ammunition after a federal appeals court struck down a state law requiring background checks for ammunition purchases, reports CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.
Last week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a blow to gun control advocates and California’s own policy framework when it ruled that the state’s first-in-the-nation law “meaningfully constrains California residents’ right to keep and bear arms.”
Voters approved the law in 2016, which required buyers to undergo background checks, and effectively banned online sales of ammunition by requiring in-person transactions with a licensed dealer. Out-of-state ammunition purchases must also be delivered from that state to a licensed seller in California.

J.R. Young, a San Jose gun owner: “Is this freedom week? … The way we live in society now — when we want to buy something, we don’t want to go and take a trip to the store.”

But changes aren’t happening just yet. Citing “a number of procedural steps that must take place,” the California Department of Justice notified gun and ammunition dealers days after the court ruling that background check requirements remain in effect until further notice.
This isn’t the first time the 2016 law has been held in a state of limbo: In 2020 a federal judge also struck down the legislation, only for the state to successfully appeal the decision afterward. Last week’s court decision follows a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that expanded some gun rights and limited state and local governments’ abilities to regulate guns. 
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has not said whether the state would appeal the most recent ruling.
Meanwhile, the state Senate is currently considering a bill that would ban the sale of new Glock-brand handguns in California, after the measure advanced through the Assembly in June.

CA Uber and Lyft drivers push to unionize


Supporters gather at a rally at the state Capitol in Sacramento, announcing new legislation allowing ride-hail drivers to unionize, on April 8, 2025. Photo by Louis Bryant III for CalMatters




Five years after voters passed Proposition 22 — which granted California ride-hailing drivers some employee benefits while classifying them as independent contractors — drivers for Uber, Lyft and other companies are pushing legislation that would grant them the right to form and join a union.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, the bill would enable drivers the right to collectively bargain, and gig companies would be required to bargain in good faith. These companies would also be required to regularly submit lists of drivers and other driver information to the state’s Public Employment Relations Board.
Bill proponents say that the ability to unionize is essential for drivers to address issues related to wages, working conditions and the lack of company communication. 
But ride-hailing companies argue that unionizing would disrupt their business model, increase the cost of rides and affect the availability of rides. The bill’s reporting requirements, they say, also violate driver privacy.

A plan to curtail medical debt

With about 4 in 10 Californians saddled with medical debt, the Legislature is considering a measure that would require hospitals to check whether patients can qualify for discounted payments before billing them, writes CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
If passed, hospitals beginning July 2027 must presume people enrolled in certain social welfare programs, such as food stamps, are eligible for financial aid. Hospitals would also be required to check whether patients are eligible if they are uninsured; enrolled in Medi-Cal but pay some share of medical costs; or enrolled in a Covered California health plan.
The California Hospital Association currently opposes the bill, arguing that hospitals already promote their financial assistance programs.
But surveys and research show that many patients aren’t well informed about these programs. Sierra Freeman, a Stockton resident who is prone to aneurysms, amassed medical bills totaling $4 million after undergoing multiple surgeries at Stanford Medical Center.
Though her employee health insurance covered the majority of the costs, Freeman researched for months on charity care to get most of the remaining sum waived. 

Freeman: “I feel like I now have the knowledge and power to apply for this the next time it happens. But I wish more people knew about it.”

Ellis A. Jacobson, age 72 passed away peacefully at home with his family in Montpelier, VT on July 19, 2025 after a brief, fierce battle with pancreatic cancer. Ellis was born in Portland, Maine on August 28, 1952 to Nellie (Levin) and Myer Jacobson.
Ellis was an artist, sculptor, mask maker, educator, curator, director, writer, actor, clown, comic and musician. His career in the arts began when he won the Best Actor award for the Children’s Theater of Maine in 1966, and from there he was hooked. He went on to get his Bachelor of the Arts in theater and his teacher’s certification at Goddard College in Plainfield, VT. In the late 60’s and early 70’s, he performed with Blackbird Theater, Two Penney Circus, and Bread and Puppet Theater. Throughout the 70’s and 80’s he wrote and performed numerous comedy shows with Barney Carlson; he juggled with Peter Youngbaer as Mister Blister and Fatman; and he created his own mask theater company, “The Regular Theater”. He toured to Oaxaca, Mexico with Dragon Dance Theater in 1994, where he created a giant mask in the town square, which was used in their performance at Monte Alban. His paper mache masks were also featured in a performance by the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera in Brooklyn in the 1990’s.
In the 2000’s he turned his energy to arts education and curation. In 2000 his masks were displayed in a one-man-show at the University of Montana. He worked in numerous Vermont schools as a theater teacher, director and artist-in-residence. He founded and curated the Artpath Gallery in Burlington, Vermont, and served as a Trustee for the T.W. Wood Art Gallery. For the past 10 plus years he has developed, run and taught after school arts programs for elementary aged children in central Vermont; most recently his own program, 3 O’Clock Art, at the Greenway campus in Montpelier. Providing an environment for his students to be able to play and create freely in whatever medium and subject matter inspired them was the most important to him, and he loved his students dearly.
Ellis loved the coast of Maine, spending time every summer body surfing and eating fried clams with family and friends in Ocean Park. He loved his chosen home of Cabot, Vermont, where he bought his first home while in college. He lived there until 2023, when he permanently moved to Montpelier. He loved making people laugh, and continued to do so even in his frequent hospital stays during his last weeks of life, cracking jokes with each person who walked into the hospital room. He loved all things and collected many, such as art, coins and antique toys, but he loved nothing better than the smile on the face of a child. He loved the extended non-traditional family that he shared with his partner of 42 years, Marilyn Nasuta, whom he married in 2012. He was a devoted grandfather to Cooper and Nellie Lamb, a step father to Rosemary Leach and a step-father-in-law to Ted Lamb. He is survived by his brother Alan Jacobson and sister-in-law Rose of Miami, FL; his nephews Brian Jacobson of Homestead FL and Mark Jacobson of Ann Arbor, MI; his brother-in-law Stephen Nasuta and sister-in-law Molly Backup of Saint Albans, VT; his niece Ditra Backup of Washington DC; as well as grand nieces, grand nephews and cousins.
Ellis was so grateful to everyone who shared their love, support, and medical expertise over the last 10 weeks including his family, his friends, his students and their families, and the staff at Greenway Institute, UVM Medical Center (especially Miller 5), Central Vermont Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Central Vermont Home Health and Hospice.

AB 1340 would let California ride-hailing drivers collectively bargain for improved pay and benefits. Uber and Lyft say it could drive ride prices up and availability down.


Uber and Lyft drivers in California have been fighting for years for higher wages and better working conditions — in the streets, before state lawmakers, in court and at the ballot. 
Now, a bill making its way through the state Legislature would allow ride-hailing drivers to unionize. 
If Assembly Bill 1340 passes, California would become the second state to give ride-hailing drivers the right to collectively bargain. Massachusetts was the first to do so after voters there approved a ballot measure last year.
The ride-hailing companies oppose the California legislation, saying it goes against the “spirit” of Proposition 22, the ballot initiative they bankrolled that voters approved in 2020. It cemented gig workers’ status as independent contractors in the state. The law also limited state lawmakers’ ability to establish collective-bargaining rights for gig workers, but an appeals court struck down that provision.
Drivers and other gig workers gained some benefits when Prop. 22 passed, but their complaints continue, many of them tied to the fact that they are not considered employees. And since the law effectively leaves no state agency in charge of enforcement, many gig workers don’t know where to turn to claim unpaid wages or health care stipends, to contest getting kicked off the apps, or to get help with other problems.
Some drivers and advocates say being able to collectively bargain could address those issues. But the gig-work industry warns that would mean big changes to their business model, which would push ride prices higher and affect the availability of rides.
“We can benefit a lot from being unionized,” said Hector Lopez, who has driven for Lyft in the Bay Area for the past several years and is involved with the group Gig Workers Rising. “It might be the only way to get fair wages.”
A group that represents Uber and Lyft has said drivers in California earn an average of $37 per “active” hour, while research from the UC Berkeley Labor Center found that the average pay for drivers, including tips and taking their entire working shifts and expenses into account, was $9.09 per hour.
Another common driver frustration is limited communication when they need help. Drivers have to use the Uber or Lyft app to message back and forth with a company representative, or in some cases talk with them on the phone. But Lopez remembers being able to get help at a Lyft Hub, a physical location staffed with human beings he could talk to. Those hubs closed down a few years ago.
“We could have a union, which would have an office, where we could get help face to face,” Lopez said. “That’s something that’s really big that they took away from us.”
Not all drivers will be on board. There is “a healthy suspicion” around unionizing among California drivers who say they value their status as independent contractors, said Sergio Avedian, senior contributor for the Rideshare Guy, a YouTube channel popular with gig workers. 
But he said many drivers also “often express frustration about a lack of representation and leverage, especially when it comes to deactivations, rate cuts and algorithmic transparency.”
What the bill would do
The proposal before the Legislature would give ride-hailing drivers the right to form and join a union with which the gig companies would be required to bargain in good faith.
It would also require ride-hailing companies to submit lists of drivers and other driver information to the state’s Public Employment Relations Board every three months starting in 2026. 
The Protect App-Based Drivers & Services Coalition, an industry group that includes Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart, opposes the legislation, as do various chambers of commerce and business groups. 
In a letter to lawmakers in July, the group said the bill’s requirement that companies submit driver information to the state — which would give a potential union a way to directly reach a dispersed group of workers — is “a dangerous violation of driver privacy” and could result in unwanted texts, phone calls and even visits to drivers. 
Different drivers groups are expected to vie to be the sole bargaining union of ride-hailing drivers statewide. But provided a group can get 10% of active drivers to approve it as a representative, it would be able to access driver lists, according to analyses of the bill by legislative committees. Each group would be prohibited from sharing that list with third parties. 
Nicole Moore, president of Los Angeles-based Rideshare Drivers United, supports the bill’s disclosure requirements. “Right now the state has no idea how badly we’re being paid,” she said. “We could tell you, but that’s anecdotal. We need data.”

Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab said the bill would mean increased costs because of administrative and compliance burdens, and the fact that the company would have to negotiate with a union over pay and benefits. The industry group said if drivers get the right to unionize, it could lead to higher costs for rides.
A Lyft spokesperson would not comment on the legislation. 
The bill, co-authored by Assemblymembers Buffy Wicks of Oakland and Marc Berman of Palo Alto, both Democrats, is set for a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Aug. 18. 
What’s happening in Massachusetts
In Massachusetts, Uber and Lyft drivers won the right to unionize months ago and are now working to make a union a reality.
Chiem Klot, who has been driving for Uber for a decade, is trying to organize Boston-area drivers. He says his pay “gets worse and worse every year.” He said he used to be able to make $300 or $400 a day, and is now driving for 12 hours a day and making about $200 a day.
“There are over 80,000 (ride-hail) drivers in Massachusetts,” Klot said. “They all work so hard to make very little money. A lot of them still don’t know they’re allowed to unionize. Some of them are also scared to — that Uber might retaliate.”
The Massachusetts App Drivers Union is a joint effort of Service Employees International Union 32BJ and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
Gabe Morgan, executive vice president of SEIU 32BJ, said through a spokesperson that thousands of drivers in Massachusetts have already signed unionization cards, and that besides fair compensation, drivers deserve transparency. 
Will sectoral bargaining work?
Sectoral bargaining, or negotiating as a group within a certain occupation, has worked in certain places and industries, such as in Los Angeles, where hospitality workers have won wage standards and benefits, said Katie Wells, a tech and labor expert who co-wrote “Disrupting D.C.: The Rise of Uber and the Fall of the City.” But Wells said she’s concerned that in the ride-hailing industry, sectoral bargaining may not lead to real change. 
That’s because the big players in the gig economy have fought to keep change “superficial,” Wells said. She pointed to Prop. 22, which among other things promised California gig workers health care stipends. But a union-backed survey showed few gig workers actually qualify for or use the stipends, which are not extended to those who get public health benefits. The survey also found that 29% of gig workers surveyed were on Medi-Cal, California’s health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities. The companies have not released exact numbers about how many workers receive the stipends.
Sectoral bargaining “could work, but it has to be done well,” said Laura Padin of the National Employment Law Project, a research and advocacy group for low-wage workers. She said drivers “are subject to a lot of control of the companies” and should be covered under the National Labor Relations Act, but they are not because they’re not considered employees. “In this political environment, it may be the best we can hope for,” Padin said.
Federal lawmakers have been trying for years to improve gig workers’ working conditions. The most recent proposal was introduced last week by Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, both Democrats. It would require gig companies to disclose more detailed information about wages and fares to drivers and consumers; cap companies’ cut of each ride’s fare at 25%, meaning 75% would go to drivers; and more. Other proposed federal legislation that would help strengthen workers’ right to organize has languished for years. So other governments are trying to step in. At the state level, besides California, Minnesota and Illinois are also considering bills to give drivers collective-bargaining power. 
But even if drivers are able to band together and unionize, they would still likely have to deal with more obstacles, experts say. 
“When drivers are able to organize and win labor standards through public policy directly, Uber tries to fight it,” said Mariah Montgomery, national campaigns director for PowerSwitch Action, a network of advocacy groups. She mentioned what has happened in New York City, where drivers won minimum pay rates that began in 2019. 
Last year, Bloomberg reported that Uber and Lyft were using a loophole in the law and systematically locking drivers out — preventing them from finding work on the apps — during certain periods. Last month, the city’s taxi commission established new rules ordering the companies to give drivers 72 hours notice before locking them out.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/040825_Gig-Workers-Rally_LB3_CM_30.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

California gun owners raced to take advantage of a new federal appeals court ruling against a law that required background checks for ammunition purchases. Some expect Gov. Gavin Newsom to appeal.


Lifelong hunter J.R. Young of San Jose rushed to an online ammunition dealer last week after a federal court decision overturned a California gun law that required background checks in person at every point of sale.
“Is this freedom week?” he said. “I was just curious to see if this striking down of the law is allowing companies to ship into the state again.
“The way we live in society now — when we want to buy something, we don’t want to go and take a trip to the store.”
Many bullet junkies, hunters and gun enthusiasts like Young quietly celebrated the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that may or may not ultimately put a dent in the state’s strict policies for purchasing ammunition.
For now, they can’t avoid the background checks. Four days after the decision, gun and ammunition dealers received notice that the in-state background check law still holds until the Department of Justice processes the ruling and issues an official mandate. 
It’s unclear what will happen to the online ammunition orders Californians tried to make before that notice.
Second Amendment advocates have been here before. They have challenged the constitutionality of the measure that restricted gun ownership, Proposition 63, ever since voters approved it in 2016 and have seen a mix of rulings for and against them.
This time, the case is unfolding after a landmark 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a New York City concealed carry law and generally limited how cities and states can restrict access to firearms.
Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the 9th Circuit ruling that curbed the California background checks, but neither he nor Attorney General Rob Bonta have said whether the state would appeal it. Newsom was the primary advocate for Prop. 63, and he has defended the state’s restrictions on the sale of guns and ammunition as meaningful in reducing gun violence.
Under the measure, consumers pay a fee for the background check, which just last month rose from $1 to $5 per sale. But more costly than that, an additional 11% excise tax went into effect in 2024 for the Gun Violence Prevention and School Safety Fund — money allocated for prevention, education, research, response, and investigation programs. That tax won’t change under the new ruling.
“Being in a one-party state, they’re going to continue to push and regulate,” said Patrick Jones, a gun store owner in Redding. “And while this may be a victory, it’s hard to get really excited about it because it’s just one in a sea of court battles that are coming.”
Jones’ Fort continues to stay in business after 60 years, but the family-owned store has seen better days.
“It’s a dying industry,” he said. “It’s not a friendly or fun business anymore. When you regulate and regulate and regulate, you kill an industry. And that’s what they want to do in California.”
Gun rights proponents are anticipating an appeal that will keep the background checks in place.
“I’m not sure why they’ve been so quiet about it,” said Kostas Moros of the Second Amendment Foundation. “You’d think they’d want to be the first to say, ‘No, no — we think this is still in effect.’ But that’s led to the confusing scenario where out of state ammo dealers had no way to know this.”
Aside from the sheer question of the background checks’ constitutionality, Moros pointed to a high rate of erroneous denials that emerged in the course of the lawsuit.
“We’re not dealing here with some reasonable version of this law,” said Moros. “It wrongfully denies, by the state’s own admission, 11% of people who try and use it. And the ratio of mistaken denials versus actual prohibited people, by the state’s own data, was 411 to 1.
“I don’t think we’d tolerate this if voter registration erroneously rejected you one out of 10 times. I don’t think that would stand for very long.”
Meanwhile in San Jose, Young kept an eye on his ammunition shipment’s tracking information from Missouri to Kansas on July 26. He’d already been charged for the purchase, but MidwayUSA had updated its website and discontinued sales to California after the justice department’s July 28 notice to dealers.
The two boxes of bullets he ordered arrived at his home on July 30. “LOL, impulsiveness paid off,” said Young, who’d previously expressed a fear of missing out on the chance at lower prices.
“To be honest, I do prefer to support my local businesses,” he said. “I run a small business myself, so I want to buy in my neighborhood. But this one, the ruling just really had me curious as to where it stands.”
Not all California gun owners and ammunition buyers feel the same as Young, however.
“We’re so close to Oregon and Reno that people are just buying out of state,” said Jones, in Redding. Besides watching his sales steadily decline over the years, he’s also seen a noticeable migration to states with more gun-friendly legislation.
“I have had a ton of customers that have left California — whether it’s Tennessee, or Utah, Idaho, Texas, all over. Often, within one day’s drive, they pick up a lot of freedom.”
But despite his political animosity, Jones said he’s not leaving his home state. “They can escape the tyranny for now, but I think you have to fight it like a disease. If you don’t fight it where it’s at, it’s going to catch you.”

(Boulder City Council meeting screengrab)Boulder City is the latest community in Nevada to enact an anti-homeless camping ban, which took effect in June.
Susan Reams, a Boulder City resident who is currently experiencing homelessness, filed a lawsuit in late July seeking to make the ordinance “more humane” and prevent the law from being enforced, especially in the triple digit heat. 
“Because of rising rent costs and (the) unemployment rate, a lot of people, including myself, are unhoused,” Reams said. “I just think there’s more that Boulder City could be doing. There’s nowhere for people to go. Boulder City doesn’t have safe camping zones or even a shelter.”
In an email to Nevada Current, a city spokesperson said it couldn’t comment on the lawsuit because it had not yet been served with it.
The council unanimously passed the ordinance May 27 that prohibits camping, sleeping, and storing personal property in a public place. Violating the ordinance is a misdemeanor and people could face up to six months in jail. 
City Attorney Brittany Walker told council members in May that the bill would “provide the city with the tools it needs in order to ensure that individuals aren’t camping in the public places and are seeking services.”
Boulder City joined Reno, Las Vegas, Henderson and Sparks along with Clark, Washoe and Nye counties in being among localities across the state that have passed or expanded various punitive measures in recent years to restrict where those experiencing homelessness can sleep or camp. 
Multiple decisions out of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes Nevada, ruled in recent years that ordinances were unconstitutional if cities didn’t have adequate shelter space for people who were sleeping in public places. 
Some cities, including the City of Las Vegas, tried to circumvent the federal court’s ruling by adopting bans on sleeping and sitting in public rights of way that would only go into effect if shelter space was available. 
The legal landscape changed in June 2024, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled local governments are not violating the 8th Amendment’s restriction on cruel and unusual punishment if they criminalize people experiencing homelessness for sleeping outside, even if there aren’t other adequate accommodations. 
More than 200 municipalities across the country have adopted anti-homeless camping bans since last year’s high court ruling, according to the National Homelessness Law Center. 
Increased statutory criminalization comes as homelessness has spiked across the country, including in Nevada.
The state saw a 17% increase in homelessness last year, according to a December report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Southern Nevada’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count, an annual snapshot of homelessness on one particular night, showed a 13-year high in the number of people experiencing homelessness. 
The data is likely an undercount. 
Among the number of those entering into homelessness is Reams, who was evicted last year. 
“I didn’t realize that you could be evicted even though your rent was paid,” she said, adding that her eviction stemmed from having two dogs in the apartment.
Though she has been able to get an occasional room at weekly motels, most of the time she has been finding discreet spots to sleep around Boulder City.
“There is a Boulder City emergency aid, but their hours are limited along with their finances,” Reams said. 
Though she has signed up to be on waitlist for housing assistance through Boulder City and other nonprofits, she hasn’t had any luck. 
In an email to the Current, the city said in 2022 it created a community resources liaison position at the Boulder City Hospital to help address needs of unhoused individuals.  
The liaison declined to be interviewed.
In the email the city said the liaison has connected unhoused individuals to services, including recently several unhoused people who were reunited with families out of town. 
“Our first response will be referrals to the Community Resources Liaison rather than issuing a citation,” the city said in an email. “The new ordinance provides a legal mechanism for the city to approach unhoused people in our parks and help connect them with available resources.” 
The city told the Current they have tallied 12 unhoused people in the city. 
In a staff report from the May 27 council meeting, officials said that “a growing number of individuals are occupying public places in Boulder City and storing personal property and belongings in public places in a manner causing concern for City staff.”
Speaking to council members at the May meeting, Boulder City Police Chief Tim Shea said some of the unhoused people officers have talked with have said they were told by law enforcement in the Las Vegas area to come to Boulder City.
Boulder City Councilwoman Denise Ashurst said she believed the city needed an ordinance “because if you don’t have something in place, then you don’t have anything to lean on if you do need something.”
Camping will still be allowed with a permit, said Walker, the city attorney. 
Walker also said it was her understanding that “there has never been a conviction under Las Vegas or Henderson ordinance for such a violation.”
However, data previously reported on by the Current showed that the Henderson Police Department issued 150 citations or arrests among 99 people for camping or sleeping in a public right of way from August 2023 to September 2024.
Shea said his department would use discretion before issuing a citation or making an arrest.
In the meantime, Reams said she is making repeated appeals to get the council to make the ordinance more humane, and has called for a town hall in order for city officials to better understand the homeless crisis. 
“I find this is a big issue in Boulder City, and I don’t think it’s going to get any better,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-7-31-25-at-3.00 PM-e1753999629889-1024x597.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

(Copyright Mark Hertzberg/for Racine County Eye)ELKHORN — At a raucous listening session in a high school auditorium Thursday evening, U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville) defended the immigration and tariff policies of  President Donald Trump and the Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed on July 4.
From the roars of the crowd, critics of the congressman appeared to account for the majority of the group that filled nearly two-thirds of the 600-seat Elkhorn High School auditorium. But there were also recurring cheers, shouts and applause at key moments from a smaller coterie of supporters in the room.
Steil represents the 1st District in Congress, which covers Southeastern Wisconsin from Janesville and Beloit east to Racine and Kenosha on the shores of Lake Michigan.
Over the last several months, Republican members of Congress have been counseled not to hold in-person events with constituents after publicity about angry crowds turning up at some GOP town halls.
Steil’s constituents have been protesting weekly outside his office in Racine for months, calling on him to hold an in-person meeting rather than telephone ones.

Taking the stage shortly after 5 p.m. and lasting for about 80 minutes there, Steil stuck with a cheerful, breezy tone. He treated the loud, impassioned and often angry audience cries as mostly a difference of opinion.
When an audience member asked Steil how he might take a stand against other congressional Republicans “who lie to the American public and malign the dignity of 70 million people on Medicaid by suggesting that they are lazy,” Steil lamented the tone of political discourse and vowed not to denigrate anyone. Then he turned the subject back to the boisterous auditorium.
“I’d say the overall majority of people here want to learn and understand my perspective, want to hear the question,” he said. “And then there’s a small group of people that are challenging.”
It was left to the moderator of the session, Janesville radio host Tim Bremel, to lecture the crowd to refrain from shouting over Steil’s answers during a Q&A period.
During one interruption, the radio host scolded, “Ladies and gentlemen, we will never get questions if we can’t keep the auditorium quiet. And please do the person who asked the question the respect of allowing his question to be answered.”
Pledge of Allegiance
Steil kicked off the session with the Pledge of Allegiance, inviting the audience to join him. They did so, some shouting the final words “and justice for all” with vehemence.
He followed with a short talk offering “just kind of an overview of where we’re at in this country to get ourselves back on track” — words that prompted more angry taunts.
Steil said that the nation’s spending is about “$1.8 trillion more than on the revenue side,” a comment that prompted scattered shouts scoffing at “tax breaks.”
He defended the expansion in the budget reconciliation law of work requirements for SNAP food aid, saying the change followed a model that Wisconsin had already instituted for the program in the 1990s.
When he switched to immigration and a graph that Steil said showed “the dramatic drop, the decrease that we have seen in border apprehensions,” a cry of “We are all immigrants!” came up from several rows of seats.
Nine minutes in, Steil made a pitch for his office’s constituent services, then appealed for restraint from the crowd.
“The more civil we are with each other — there’s people that have different views in here, we heard applause and boos on the border security issue, we’ve heard it a couple of times,” he said. “We have people on all sides, it’s great, that’s what makes us so great.”
Tariffs, ICE and deportation
The questions that followed came from members of the audience who filled out forms at tables in the school lobby.
Bremel told the crowd that the questioners would be chosen at random. Some greeted that claim with loud skeptical scoffs. Over the course of the hour, however, the vast majority of people who were chosen asked questions sharply critical of Steil, Trump, the Republican congressional majority, or all three.
Criticizing Trump’s tariffs, Tom Burke asked Steil “what dire economic circumstances” justified the president’s executive orders to impose them.
“What we need to do is make sure that we’re having other countries treat the United States fairly,” Steil replied, adding that the U.S. should “work collectively with our allies to address the real culprit, which is China.”
Burke wasn’t satisfied with the answer. U.S. allies, “seem to be alienated beyond belief,” he told Steil, adding that until he got a satisfactory answer to his question about their rationale, “I’m going to be totally opposed to these tariffs — period.”
Specifying that her question was about “not politics, but morality,” Jean Henderson of Elkhorn told Steil, “What I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, terrifies me.”
Henderson criticized the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel, their faces hidden by masks, against immigrants “who are doing the right thing by going to the immigration office,” only to be taken into custody. “It is a trap,” she said. “Why is this happening and why aren’t you stopping it?”
Steil began in reply, “What I view is the moral hazard created by the Biden administration…,” prompting a roar of disapproval from the crowd, then a shout of “Joe Biden sucks!” from someone perhaps more sympathetic to the congressman.
The rest of Steil’s response was largely drowned out.
When it was her turn at the microphone, Kelly Neuens connected the experiences of her grandparents and great aunt and great uncle, who were held in U.S. internment camps during World War II as U.S. citizens of Japanese descent, to the conditions in the El Salvador prison where the Trump administration has sent some immigrants taken into custody.
“President Trump said, ‘Homegrowns are next’ when he was speaking to the El Salvador president,” Neuens told Steil. “My worry is that we are repeating history here.”
A plea for the climate
In his answer, which was repeatedly interrupted, Steil described the World War II internment as “one of the more darker chapters of American history,” then added, “As we look at the engagement that law enforcement is doing now against immigrants who are in the country illegally, I don’t see the  exact parallel.”
Another questioner asked Steil to explain “why you support Linda McMahon and defunding the Department of Education?”
Congress, Steil said, is still “analyzing what the spending will be for the upcoming fiscal year.” He added that the department “has burdened a lot of our local school districts with unnecessary red tape” in the course of distributing funds to the states. “I think what we will see as we negotiate this going forward is a way to make sure that those funds are there” for local schools, he said.
When it was her turn to ask a question, Sharna Ahern of Fontana thanked Steil and his staff “for answering all the contacts I’ve made with you over the years.”
She enumerated a wide range of concerns she has had — about the Department of Education, about the treatment of immigrants, “about the rule of law and civil rights” — and then turned her focus on the environment.
“Extreme weather conditions are happening more frequently as we experience them,” she told Steil. “The EPA is deregulating the standards that are in place to fight climate change, to protect the citizens. Where do you stand on this issue? And how can you be an advocate for us to initiate legislation to restore our safeguards?”
Steil praised Wisconsin as “one of the most beautiful states in the country” and asserted that “making sure that we’re protecting our air and water and soil is absolutely essential.” He said that on the issue of climate change, “what we need to be doing is focused on addressing that global aspect. But again, make sure other countries are doing their fair share of it.”
The crowd largely jeered at the response. When another audience member asked about Trump’s executive orders rolling back Biden administration measures to address climate change, Steil said that action was necessary to “correct … the overreach in the previous administration.”
It was after 6 p.m. when Bremel called for the final question.
A few minutes earlier, someone had shouted a question about “children starving in Gaza,” and the woman whose turn it was asked Steil to address that topic as well as to defend the SNAP cuts.
“I can do them both,” Steil said. He started with SNAP, reiterating his earlier assertion that Wisconsin would not be affected by the program’s changes to work requirements because of policies the state had in place already.
Turning to Gaza, Steil said, “To me the easy answer to address this crisis is for Hamas to surrender and release the hostages. Release them. Israel was unfairly, unjustly attacked.”
His comments gave rise to another brief demonstration, punctuated by repeated chants of “60,000 people are dead!”
By the time the chanting ended, Steil had left the stage.

Nevada Health Link, formally known as the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, is the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. The Nevada Division of Insurance on Thursday announced that carriers offering individual market plans through the exchange have proposed an average premium rate increase of 17.5%.
That is a significantly higher rate hike than recent years. This time last year, the Nevada Division of Insurance announced a proposed average rate increase of 7.11% for 2025.
The proposed rate hikes in Nevada are on track with national expectations. KFF reported that, among the 19 states whose proposed rate changes were available in mid-July, the median for premium increase requests was 15%. Insurers have cited the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits and the impact of tariffs as reasons for the hike, according to KFF.
The enhanced premium tax credits were enacted in 2021 as part of pandemic relief measures, and increased the dollar amount of credit ACA enrollees received while also relaxing eligibility requirements. The enhanced credit was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, but will expire at the end of this year.
Nevada’s 17.5% proposed increase rate only reflects adjustments to plans currently being offered. It does not take into account rates for new plans, such as the Nevada public option plans scheduled to be available this fall for coverage starting next year.
Named Battle Born State Plans, these public-option plans must cover the same essential benefits as other exchange plans but “must meet specific premium reduction targets, meaning more Nevadans may have access to affordable coverage, regardless of income,” according to a Nevada State Health Authority statement that accompanied the announcement about proposed rate hikes.
Nevada’s public option was greenlit during the 2021 Legislative Session through a bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and supported only by Democrats. It was approved by the federal government early this year. Analyses estimated that public option plans could offer plans 15% cheaper than average over the next four years.
It’s not clear whether the new plans will provide any relief for consumers in the upcoming year. The Nevada State Health Authority was not available for comment Thursday.
A spokesperson for the Nevada Division of Insurance on Thursday said they were unable to provide additional information about how the forthcoming public options plans will compare to plans currently on the exchange because rates have not been finalized.
Approved rates for all plans will be available Oct. 1.
In the meantime, the Division of Insurance is inviting consumers to weigh in on proposed rate changes by submitting comments on its website. The website includes proposed rate hikes by carrier.
Open enrollment will begin Nov. 1 for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The open enrollment period ends Jan. 15, 2026.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner told an interim committee made up of Idaho legislators that President Donald Trump and his administration are ushering in a nuclear renaissance that Idaho will lead.
“I have been a nuclear engineer for over 30 years now, and during the majority of my career, we’ve been shutting down perfectly good operational nuclear power plants for economic reasons,” Wagner said Wednesday during the Idaho Legislature’s Interim Committee on Federalism at the State Capitol in Boise.
But Trump and the new U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are changing the game for nuclear energy and research, Wagner said.
“I can’t even … emphasize properly how significantly different this is than any other action by an administration on nuclear energy in my lifetime,” Wagner said.
Building new nuclear reactors in Idaho and beyond
Idaho National Laboratory is one of 17 U.S. Department of Energy national labs, and is considered the nation’s leading nuclear energy research and development national lab.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

Now, for the first time in 50 years, Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of building and permitting new nuclear reactors, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
During his presentation, Wagner highlighted four executive orders that Trump issued in May regarding nuclear energy.
The executive orders calls for reinvigorating the nuclear industrial base, reforming nuclear reactor testing, deploying advanced nuclear technology for national security and reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that was created by Congress to ensure the safe use of radioactive materials, Wagner told legislators.
Wagner said the executive orders enable up to 10 gigawatts of new nuclear reactors to be under construction by the end of this decade.
Overall, the executive orders include at least 30 direct tasks and aggressive timelines, Wagner said.
“Other than the two reactors in Georgia, we have not been building new reactors over the last three decades,” Wagner said “And so this is about reinvigorating that nuclear industrial base to enable the nuclear renaissance.”
This is the second time since spring that a committee of legislators has been briefed on Idaho National Laboratory ramping up its operations. In May, members of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee toured the Hot Fuel Examination Facility and other buildings at Idaho National Laboratory’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)Alabama lawmakers are preparing to reintroduce a bill that would make the rape or sodomy of a child a capital offense, punishable by death, state officials said in a press conference Thursday.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, one of the bill’s sponsors, said that while it is “unfortunate” that such a bill is “necessary,” the rape of a child is “the worst of the worst of offenses” and therefore “deserves the worst of the worst punishments.”
HB 29, sponsored by Simpson in the 2024 legislative session, would have given adults who rape or commit sodomy against a child under six the death penalty or life in prison without parole, while those under 18 would receive a life sentence. The bill was amended in House committee to extend the punishment to those who commit such crimes against children under 12 and passed the House on an 86-5 vote, but did not make it to the Senate floor for a vote.
Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, who plans to file a similar bill in the Senate, said that the death penalty is meant as a deterrent.
“The death penalty is meant to be a deterrent, and if passing this bill keeps one innocent child from suffering, it will have done its job, and if it sends even one child predator to an early grave, well, that works too,” Weaver said at the press conference.
This legislative push comes after seven people were arrested in Bibb County for their alleged involvement in a child sex trafficking ring. Jody Wade, sheriff in Bibb County, who has been briefed on the bill but had not had a chance to review it, said at the press conference that he wanted to show support for the bill.
“As we work to give a voice to these victims that haven’t been able to have their say as of yet, we just want to take time out to come here and voice our support for this legislation,” Wade said.
Both Simpson and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, who also attended the press conference, said the legislation is in part a direct challenge to a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision, known as Kennedy v. Louisiana, that declared the death penalty unconstitutional for crimes against individuals that do not result in the victim’s death. Both said that the legal landscape has changed enough since the 5-4 ruling. Supporters of the bill think the current  ourt will be more supportive
“The Supreme Court acted back in 2008 to invalidate the efforts of states to be able to engage in capital punishment for a case in which there was no death, but there’s a time to reevaluate the analysis that the Supreme Court used, as well as the importance that states have placed upon this issue moving forward,” Marshall said.
Simpson added that the court’s decision in 2008 was based on a lack of states with similar laws, a situation he believes is now changing.
“There is a push now to change that, that narrative. There are states that are trying to do it. So, it’s not going to be unusual because others try to do it,” Simpson said.
Simpson pointed to recent legislation in other states, including Florida and Tennessee in 2023 and 2024, and Idaho, Oklahoma, and Arkansas in 2025, as a reason that the Supreme Court might reconsider its 2008 decision. Simpson believes that if Alabama’s bill passes and an individual is charged under it, other states could file amicus briefs in support, which could convince the Supreme Court to reconsider its previous decision.
Marshall said his office is prepared to defend the law and would support other states with similar laws.
“We prepared to do it the moment we have that opportunity,” Marshall said.
Potential effects
Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said in a phone interview after the press conference that such legislation may be counterproductive. She noted the Kennedy decision rested in part on testimony from experts who work with child sexual assault victims. Such a policy, they said, would worsen the problem of underreporting sexual abuse, increase the incentives for child molesters to kill their victims and heighten the trauma that child victims experience in the criminal justice process.
“Those experts said that making this crime death-eligible would only increase the danger to children and result in reduced reporting of child sex abuse by family members,” Maher said.
An amicus brief filed by the National Association of Social Workers and other organizations in the Kennedy case states that the majority of child sexual abuse is committed by family members or close friends. Victims and their families may be hesitant to report abuse due to fear of the consequences for the abuser, a fear that would be significantly increased by a threat of the death penalty, the brief said. 
The brief also argued that allowing the death penalty for child rape might lead to more victims being killed, since offenders might be more likely to murder the child to prevent them from testifying, since the punishment for rape and murder would both be death.
“If an offender believes that he will be sentenced to death if convicted of either raping a child or murdering that child, the offender will have every incentive to kill his victim and thus eliminate the primary witness to the crime. The offender will as a result also be more likely to remain free to abuse additional children, in Louisiana and elsewhere,” the amicus brief stated.
Simpson countered that claim in the press conference, saying that perpetrators keep victims alive and commit “that offense repeatedly, multiple times over a length of period of time.”
“They don’t just stop,” Simpson said.
The brief also states that death penalty trials would force child victims to “relive painful events repeatedly.” A study cited in the brief found that testifying repeatedly was associated with “poorer later mental health, including more trauma-related symptoms”. The appeals process can last for years, with one study finding the average time between sentencing and execution to be over 12 years.
Marshall countered those concerns, saying that “kids are strong” and that forcing them to testify is “sadly, what we have to do in a criminal justice system.”
“We’re not creating additional stress for victims because it’s a death-eligible case, those that offend children have created that problem, and the criminal justice system becomes the only vehicle for which we can provide them with relief,” Marshall said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250731_1606042462-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

(Photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey's Alaska Science Center)A management overhaul is needed to address the faltering salmon runs in the Yukon River and the widespread harms that have resulted from shortages of fish along the river’s basin, according to a report by Indigenous leaders and Alaska scientists.
The report, a peer-reviewed policy brief published in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, proposes an independent review of Yukon River Chinook and chum salmon issues by an entity like the National Academy of Sciences. It also recommends bigger management and science roles for Indigenous residents who live along the river, which flows nearly 2,000 miles from Canada’s Yukon Territory to the Bering Sea.
Building relationships between tribal members and government managers will likely require long-term effort, says the report, which has co-authors from various organizations, including the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“Trust between Indigenous communities and fisheries scientists and managers needs to be enhanced by continuously, transparently, and equitably combining quantitative fisheries analyses with Indigenous Knowledge,” the report says.
The report recommends a “cultural exemption” for small-scale personal harvests by river residents to help address inequities between commercial and subsistence fishers.
And it recommends more at-sea safeguards, including new or expanded protected areas.
The recommendations are intended to address factors that the report identifies as hurting Yukon River salmon. Those include climate change and acidification in the Bering Sea; warming temperatures and streamflow changes in the river and its tributaries; competition for ocean resources from increasing volumes of hatchery fish; and accidental netting of salmon, known as bycatch, by trawl vessels targeting pollock and other species.
Some of the recommendations clash with Trump administration policies.

	The administration has slashed research on federal fisheries and climate change. Additionally, an April 17 executive order by President Donald Trump pushes for bigger commercial seafood harvests and revocation of marine protection designations.
One of the report’s Indigenous authors said Trump administration policies should not prevent the reforms.
“I would say that it’s not a question of optimism. It’s a question of being pragmatic and practical,” said Ed Alexander, co-chair of the U.S-Canada Gwich’in Council International.
An example of a scientific subject that he said needs further exploration – and for which local Indigenous knowledge would be useful – is the effects on salmon of the decades-old hydroelectric dam in Whitehorse, the Yukon Territory’s main city. It is the only dam on the river.
The idea of protected marine areas is not new, Alexander added. He cited the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area that was established in 2016 by then-President Barack Obama, abolished by Trump in his first term, resurrected by President Joe Biden and then abolished by Trump in his second term.
Legislation at the state and federal levels is already pending that would address one of the recommendations: establishment of tribal representation on the North Pacific Fishery Management Council and the Alaska Board of Fisheries.
Former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, included a North Pacific council tribal provision in a bill she sponsored to reauthorize the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management. That bill did not pass before she lost her seat in the U.S. House. A similar bill, with the tribal seat provision, has been reintroduced by one of her bill’s co-sponsors, Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California.
A state bill sponsored by Rep. Nellie Jimmie, D-Toksook Bay, would designate two of the seven seats on the Alaska Board of Fisheries for subsistence users. It would also designate seats for commercial, sport and science representatives.
The measure, House Bill 125, passed the House on May 17 and is now pending in the state Senate.

Of course, the retired ear, nose and throat doctor is concerned about federal cuts to Medicaid spending, which could leave millions of Americans without insurance and strain hospitals, nursing homes and home-based care programs that senior citizens rely on.
But Singleton, 85, who now lives in a retirement community in Overland Park and was recently elected to the Kansas Silver-Haired Legislature, is also concerned about cuts to food assistance programs and economic policies like tariffs and tax cuts that he fears will push up prices.
“Everything has ramifications on aging individuals,” he said, “and those individuals who are on fixed incomes get hurt the worst.”
Singleton is not alone. Many advocates working to help senior citizens in the Kansas City area worry, too. A growing population of older low-income adults, they said, already struggles to find health care, pay rent and afford food.
In Missouri, almost 10% of the state’s 1.1 million residents 65 years old or older live below the poverty level and 22% receive food assistance. In Kansas, 8.5% of the state’s 510,000 seniors live below the poverty level.
“We do not have the infrastructure to meet the needs of the region’s aging population at this moment,” said Jeron Ravin, president and CEO of Swope Health, a safety-net health clinic in Kansas City that has made improving that infrastructure one of its priorities.
And that’s the situation before provisions in new federal legislation, President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” go into effect.
That legislation will cut $911 billion in spending on Medicaid over the next decade and trim $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), causing an estimated 22 million households to lose all or part of their food assistance.
All of that will hurt low-income seniors and the long-term care facilities, health care providers and community organizations that they rely on, senior advocates said.
“We’re in crisis now,” said Janet Baker, executive director of KC Shepherd’s Center, which provides meals and other support to older, mainly low-income adults. “We can’t meet the need that we already have, and that need is just going to grow.”
 Growing older populations

In both Missouri and Kansas, older adults make up a growing portion of the populations.
A recent survey of older Missourians found that almost one-third of respondents couldn’t access the health care they needed, often because it cost too much or they couldn’t find a provider in their area. And at least three in 10 said they didn’t have enough money to afford healthy meals.
“We’ve seen this coming for a long time based on demographics and population shift,” said Rachel Ohlhausen, director of program partnerships with Jewish Family Services, “and we haven’t seen federal dollar investments that match.”
In fact, since Trump returned to office in January, the opposite has happened.
Funding has been slashed for safety-net programs like Meals on Wheels and transportation services to help older adults get to the doctor or the grocery store. Area agencies like KC Shepherd’s Center and Jewish Family Services have been forced to turn down requests for help from seniors and their families.
Food pantries and meal sites, meanwhile, also are struggling to help food-insecure seniors as federal food aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture also experiences steep cuts. And affordable housing for seniors is a growing need.
According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, people 50 years or older represent the fastest-growing group experiencing homelessness. The organization predicts that that group will triple in size by 2030.
In Kansas City, Swope Health will break ground Aug. 7 on a development at 5900 Swope Parkway designed to include 200 units of senior affordable housing, along with senior health and dental clinics.
But Ravin said plans for the project, called Swope Health Village, may be curtailed by federal funding cuts, which will likely take money away from community health clinics like Swope by reducing the number of patients covered by Medicaid and potentially increasing the number who need free care.
In addition, he said, the donations required to complete future phases of the project will be harder to come by.
“The question is, due to these cuts, will the project, instead of being completed within five years, take 10 years or 15 years?” Ravin said. “All safety-net providers are likely to be less financially secure. Philanthropy is going to have more of us asking them for support than ever. And, you know, the well is only so big.”
 Impact on care for seniors

Across the spectrum, health providers are expecting to feel the effect of cuts to Medicaid funding.
The new federal law will reduce the number of people who can receive Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance program, by adding work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks. Some of those requirements could be especially burdensome for seniors, advocates said.
The law also shifts more of the program’s costs, which have always been jointly funded by state and federal taxes, to states. Finding those dollars in Missouri and Kansas will probably be difficult.
In addition to federally qualified health clinics like Swope that rely heavily on revenue from patients covered by Medicaid, safety-net hospitals like University Health in Kansas City expect to lose revenue. And so will long-term care facilities like nursing homes, which already have faced headwinds in recent years.
Medicaid covers 65% of residents in Missouri nursing homes and 58% in Kansas nursing homes.
During the COVID pandemic, long-term care facilities became ground zero for deaths because the virus so easily spread in close quarters and residents’ health and age made them more vulnerable.
Many patients moved out of the facilities as well, resulting in empty beds and, in some cases, closed doors.
Kansas once had at least one skilled nursing home option in all 105 counties in the state. Now nine counties have none, said Linda MowBray, president and CEO of the Kansas Health Care Association and Kansas Center for Assisted Living, which represents long-term care facilities in the state.
MowBray praised the Kansas legislature for adding funding to the Medicaid program to increase reimbursement rates for long-term care facilities. But reimbursements still don’t meet the actual cost, she said, and many facilities continue to struggle financially. The new federal law won’t help, she said.
Most concerning to her members, MowBray said, is a reduction in the amount of time people have to qualify for Medicaid coverage once they’ve moved into a long-term care facility.
Currently, if a person enters with a Medicaid application pending, they get 90 days to complete the cumbersome process. The facility will be reimbursed for the time the patient’s application was pending as long as approval comes within that 90-day window.
But the new law shortens that window to 60 days, which may not be long enough for many older patients to complete the process, MowBray said. That means nursing homes won’t be reimbursed for all of the days that the application process requires.
“This will force providers to take a serious look at how much risk they can take,” MowBray said.
Some small facilities may not be able to afford the risk, she said.
“The concern is … where are these people going to go?” MowBray said. “Are they just parked in the hospital while the application is going through? And if it doesn’t go through, and they’re beyond 60 days and the hospital doesn’t get paid, that’s an even bigger bill that’s going to have to get written off.”
Marie Dunham, an owner of Blue Hills Rest Home in Independence, is not ready to panic. After four decades in this business, she said, she’s seen this play out before when people have worried about government benefits being reduced but then everything turned out to be fine.
“Every time we get a new president, a new governor, everybody always gets this fear factor,” Dunham said. “Everybody needs to take a big breath.”
Blue Hills, an assisted living facility, serves senior citizens and people with disabilities. The vast majority of them receive Medicaid. Dunham doesn’t believe the state of Missouri will abandon this population.
“There’s got to be homes to take care of our people — our elderly and disabled,” Dunham said. “They’re not going to put our people out on the streets.”
 Ripple effects

Baker, who, in addition to her role with KC Shepherd’s Center, serves in Missouri’s Silver-Haired Legislature, is less optimistic. She expects to see more nursing homes close and more seniors left at greater risk.
“More hunger, more hardship and more homeless seniors,” she said. “I don’t believe the state is prepared from the standpoint that senior services are inadequately funded in the first place.”


In 2023, then-Missouri Gov. Mike Parson launched a study to develop a master plan on aging for the state. Officials are holding town hall meetings across the state before the report is finalized later this year.


Low-income older adults will almost certainly feel the ripple effects that follow cuts to federal funding, health leaders said. Even before those cuts passed Congress, states were expecting increased needs among the growing senior population. And both Missouri and Kansas have been planning.
In 2023, then-Missouri Gov. Mike Parson launched a study to develop a master plan on aging for the state. Officials are holding town hall meetings across the state before the report is finalized later this year. A Kansas City event is scheduled at 9 a.m. Aug. 1 at the Kauffman Foundation at 4801 Rockhill Road.
And the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services has drafted a state plan on aging that makes several recommendations for improving care for older Kansans.
Now the question becomes whether the current political landscape will allow priorities laid out in the state plans to be implemented. Observers fear that fiscal and political realities make that unlikely.
Missouri has shifted its own tax policy, including eliminating the state’s capital gains tax earlier this year, which will mean less tax revenue coming in. And federal changes to Medicaid and SNAP will force both states to carry a greater portion of the costs of those programs, meaning less money for other priorities.
Stacy Morse, executive director of the Missouri Council on Aging, said she hopes state legislators will understand that priorities included in the master plan on aging, which her organization supports, are recommendations from people around the state.
After tax cuts, “it’s going to be really hard … to fund these services and support that people across Missouri are saying they need,” Morse said. “There’s a complete disconnect between what we want and what Missouri is willing to pay for.”
Even if big financial investments are not possible in the current environment, small changes could still help, said Mindy Ulstad, who has led the master plan process from her post with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
For example, the master plan will recommend that the state work on a “no wrong door” policy for seniors in the state, so one call to a single agency will let them get all their questions answered. And the state can work on outreach, so seniors have a better idea of what services are available to help them.
“There may be things that are harder to enact over the next few years,” she said. But the state can work on “getting information out about what’s available and helping people navigate those systems.”
Ulstad also said that the information gathered during the process of writing the master plan will be available to local governments and community organizations so they can learn from it and perhaps implement some of its recommendations.
“We are letting people know that the plan will be out there and they can use it for their own strategic planning,” she said.
Increasingly, support for older adult services is falling to county taxpayers. In November, for example, Jackson County voters passed a tax levy that will raise $8 million annually to support senior services beginning sometime next year. Across the state, 55 other counties have similar taxes.
But as state legislators look at limiting property taxes, Morse fears that this source of revenue could be at risk, too. In testimony before a Missouri House committee on the issue, she urged legislators to remember that those taxes are helping seniors.
“We recognize that there is this need to reduce the property tax burden,” she said. “Also that the assessments may have increased too quickly, and it took a lot of people by surprise. But what we want to remind you is that the property taxes are providing really necessary services. For the older adults, it’s helping them age in place.”
More patients are likely to need support to stay at home. Many people can’t afford long-term care or would prefer to be in a familiar place.
Swope Health started a program a year ago called PACE KC, which relies on Medicaid and Medicare payments to provide health care and social support like transportation to Jackson County residents who are 55 or older.
But the reality is that more people will need more help, especially after federal and state cuts are absorbed.
“It will get worse before it gets better,” Ohlhausen said, “and my hope is that we learn and we really try to hold on to what we want to build back on the other side.”
She is also still holding out hope that lawmakers will reconsider and reverse some of the funding cuts before they take effect.
“I don’t know if that’s possible, but whatever is possible should be pursued.”

Bill Finch was bumping along in a muddy four-wheel utility vehicle on a rocky road near the Paint Rock Forest Research Center when a research assistant in another four-wheeler rumbled up next to him.
“Are you going to check the Hawthorn? Has it leafed out yet?” Nathan Paris called out to him that spring morning.
Finch, whose gray beret, wire-rim glasses and full white beard lend him a professorial air, turned off his engine and shook his head. “Be patient,” he said.
Longtime conservationist Finch has spent a lifetime practicing patience in his study of forest dynamics, genetic diversity and how this lush landscape of northeast Alabama will be affected by changing environmental conditions. His quest is to understand the trees and their prospects. What he shares from his wanderings in one of the richest biodiverse regions in North America will likely inform conservation methods for generations and influence future strategies to adapt to a changing climate.
Finch is the co-founder of a research center in Paint Rock Valley, 4,000 wild acres edged by mountains and laced with clear springs and streams. The center is perched within The Nature Conservancy’s Sharp Bingham Preserve, not far from Huntsville.
The Hawthorn tree that prompted the early morning exchange is a once-thought extinct species—not seen since 1914 and a most satisfying surprise for Finch a couple years ago. He had noticed on daily treks in the forest an unusual patch of some Hawthorn under a canopy of mature tall trees. Finch identified two species, was uncertain about the third type of the thorny branched deciduous and was stumped by the other foliage.
Finch reached out to Brian Keener, a professor of biological sciences and founder of the digital compendium Alabama Plant Atlas at the University of West Alabama, who raised the possibility that the mysterious tree was the extinct Hawthorn.
Finch and Keener called Ron Lance, a Hawthorn expert from South Carolina and author of a definitive book on the Crataegus genus, a family of trees related to apples and pears. They compared the unknown species to the official botanical reference dating from 1914, which includes dried leaf, fruit and flower collections known as a herbarium specimen. Their epiphany? They rediscovered a species native to a few counties in the Cumberland region of Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia with its distinctive large and hairy leaves and stems.

Finch collected seeds for DNA analysis and seed propagation, part of Finch’s ongoing endeavor to document species survival and adaptation. The nonprofit HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville and the University of Georgia also contributed significant help.
“Biodiversity is a tool” to deal with a rapidly changing world, Finch said. “We don’t know what the future is going to look like in 2075, and biodiversity represents our choices for the future. And if we don’t have that biodiversity, we’ve lost our choices to adapt to all the changes we know about and all the changes we still can’t predict.”
Finch’s career spans five decades of great change. He studied forestry as a student at Warren Wilson College, located in the shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina. His first job out of college was writing about herb gardens for Mother Earth News, a bimonthly launched in 1970 and rooted in respect for ecology and back-to-the-land sensibilities. His wife, Beth Maynor Finch, a renowned photographer, has chronicled the wild places of the South for several decades.They initially met collaborating on a book about the longleaf pine forest and later reconnected through their mutual interest in conservation.
Finch joined the Mobile Press Register as an editor and environmental writer from 1993 to 2005 and crossed paths with E.O. Wilson, American biologist and naturalist who became a friend and colleague. By 2006, Finch was named director of conservation at The Nature Conservancy.

In 2007, he joined with Wilson, a native of Alabama who had retired from Harvard University in 1996 after 40 years of teaching but remained as professor emeritus, and Stephen Hubbell and Patricia Adair Gowaty, distinguished biologists and professors emeritus from University of California who are married, to consider how to create a research plot in a diverse, temperate and mature forest.
While the group dreamed and planned, Wilson and Hubbell engaged in heated philosophical debates rooted in intellectual curiosity and determining what the limits could or should be. “Ed would say, ‘I want to know everything,’ and Steve would say, ‘That’s just unknowable,’” Finch recalled.
Wilson, who asserted “80 percent of the species out there, we don’t know,” wanted to understand each individual species. Hubbell wanted to investigate the broader impacts on ecosystems, Finch added.
It took a decade of searching for land and raising funds, but in 2017, their vision, encompassing both approaches, came to fruition at Paint Rock Forest Research Center.


They were fortuitous to land in this Alabama valley at the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains on the Cumberland Plateau because “this is one of the last great wild places in the eastern U.S.,” Finch said.
The Paint Rock Forest Research Center includes a house and a barn, built by a former private owner, now used for seed processing. The property sits atop a natural cave system with an underground water supply from cave pools and waterfalls and covers a diverse terrain, including sandstone plateaus, wetlands and thickets of bamboo.
The research plot is a dynamic, thriving expanse with 150 acres mapped into 1,600 survey plots, each 20 by 20 meters (65 by 65 feet). So far, 86,000 trees, including seedlings as thin as a pencil and seasoned timbers three feet in diameter and pushing up to 130 feet in the sky, have been measured, tagged and identified.

Annually, there are dozens of researchers and fellows—including students and faculty from University of Alabama, Jacksonville State University, University of Georgia, University of West Alabama and national institutes—who visit to collect genetic material to document new species and understand how species interact, survive, evolve and adapt to a changing environment.
The forest will serve this generation and the next as a potential genetic reservoir for climate-resistant tree species, Finch said. And it will help answer a critical and monumental question.
“What is the future of species, and what is our future with those species?” Finch said.
“Both survivals are interlinked.”

‘Keys to the future’

Standing in the forest that has existed as long as 100 years and surrounded by towering trees about to leaf out, Finch picks up a large, brown leaf with black spots. While some foresters in the past have suggested the unusual leaves are a hybrid oak leaf, Finch believes they are evidence of a new species and his team is investigating. Other potential new species on the preserve include violets, maples, elms, and Robinia (a legume-like tree).
“As climate changes, we have the keys to the future,” Finch said about his effort to understand how species and ecosystems interact and survive in order to protect Alabama’s irreplaceable natural heritage and safeguard it as a critical national resource for ecological understanding and adaptation
Alabama served as a “refugia” during the ice ages. Here many species survived and diversified, making it a global hotspot of biodiversity. Its varied geology, including limestone habitats, and its high rainfall levels—up to 70 inches per year—have also contributed to its biodiversity.
Today, Alabama has 40 native oak species compared to only 12 along the entire Appalachian trail. Alabama is the national center of magnolia and buckeye diversity and accounts for 80 percent of all hickory trees in the world, Finch said.
Alabama is also the center of freshwater aquatic diversity in the United States—its waters have the nation’s greatest number of mollusks and fish—and has more species of mussels than all of South America, making it a global center of such diversity, according to Finch.
Its inherent riches provide a natural cleansing of air and water, moderate the temperature, help to limit flooding, cycle nutrients to crops and spur pollinations for flower and agriculture, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species co-director of The National Center for Biodiversity. Most modern-day medications also come from species that thrive in the forest, he said.

Species are the building blocks of ecosystems that support our way of life, he said. But beyond the practical considerations, “we’re making our world a less interesting and more lonely place as we lose more and more species,” Greenwald said. “We lose some of the beauty and the magic of the world every day.”
The center, with four full-time and three part-time employees and an annual operating budget over $300,000, isn’t involved in forest genetics research alone. The center has about equal funds for fellowship and scholarships. Researchers are exploring cave ecosystems, monitoring aquatic species, restoring shortleaf pine and bamboo ecosystems, studying wildflowers and conducting bird and insect surveys in partnership with a variety of state, national and international research institutions.
Alabama contains populations and genetic resources that can be used to repopulate and restore degraded ecosystems in other parts of the country, acting as a “storehouse” and “warehouse” of species diversity, Finch said.
“Diversity helps us weather change, and the more diversity you have, the more choices you have to deal with those changes.”
But ecosystem restoration isn’t simple. “You can’t just move a tree here, you have to understand why trees have survived here and what’s happening in the soil,” Finch said. Understanding soil and respecting the pathogens within helps drive diversity, he said.
Finch drops the unidentified oak leaf, which flutters to the ground. Then he points to the small silver tag, attached by his research team, that hangs like a necklace and identifies one of the almost 100,000 trees that his center monitors.
“We’re here for a special reason. Understanding heat-tolerant species and heat-tolerant genetics within species. What happens for New England forests—as things change—is they will have to borrow from Alabama.
“Our diversity will be their diversity.”

When forests are reduced

While a 4,000-acre preserve might seem expansive, it’s quite small in terms of preserving a complete ecosystem. When forests are cut off and reduced in size, they fit what E.O. Wilson described as “island biogeography,” where small isolated areas become less diverse with more species loss.
“If we’re going to have any chance of a future on this Earth, we’re going to have to do more than have places where we walk our dogs,” Finch said. According to estimates by Greenwald’s National Center for Biodiversity, one third of all species—a million species in all—are at risk if climate change proceeds unchecked. Studying individual species and forest preservation in isolated patches without considering the broader context would be “like studying the sea worthiness of the Titanic while it was sinking,” Finch added.
At the Paint Rock Forest Research Center, researchers have sought to expand their methods and horizons.
In the past, researchers collected fresh young green leaves from the tree canopy by taking strategic shots at the top of the trees. Using a 12-gauge shotgun, researchers would pepper #4 lead shot at specific branches. The tumbling leaves were immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen for genetic tests and molecular study back at the center’s labs.
This spring, in collaboration with HudsonAlpha, the center’s researchers cast unwieldy 35-foot lineman’s poles into the upper branches of the trees to “fish” fresh leaves from the top of the canopy. Leaves from more than a hundred trees will be examined this way in an attempt to better understand how trees age, thrive and survive.
Researchers luckily beat nature by a matter of days during their leaf mission. They collected leaf samples just before 185 mile-an-hour high winds splintered 200 acres of the mature forest, cutting off access to that area for further research for now. They may, in the future, consider whether drones could be used to help document the ancient forest.
Researchers from the University of Alabama are currently pursuing another project to reconstruct 300 years of forest history, counting tree rings and conducting core sampling of trees to understand the forest’s historical composition and changes.

During the 20th century, the building of dams contributed to the largest mass extinction event in North America. The Tennessee Valley Authority completed the Wilson Dam in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in 1924, and Alabama Power built seven hydroelectric dams over the course of the century.
The dams destroyed habitats and disrupted migration, resulting in the extinction or eradication of 40 species of freshwater snails and mussels, according to the Alabama Rivers Alliance. Human activity played prominently in sculpting the current environment.
Finch stood in an area of the forest that he refers to as a “sink,” where the ground dips from a cave system that collapsed centuries ago. The entire Paint Rock Valley is essentially a collapsed cave system, where rainfall has been absorbed by the karst or limestone in the ground, which may have played an important role in preserving tree species. Humans have always interacted with the land, but they didn’t always have the tools to wipe out everything and make it a golf course, Finch said a bit wryly.
Homesteaders lived in this section of the forest, he said. The trees tell the story, revealing different growth patterns in open areas, specifically a big white oak nearby that he points out.
Finch sees what he calls a “wolf-like” pattern in the tree’s profile—it stands as a lone wolf, larger and older with spreading branches indicative of growing in an open, sunlit area. The time the homesteaders left 120 years ago can be measured by the age of the pines growing in what was a field or pasture, Finch said.
In May, Finch had a chance to observe the ravages of nature and consider, once again, his own reverence for its immense power. On May 20, a tornado tore through the forest’s deep ravines, reshaping the landscape.
The day Finch stood and surveyed the damage he couldn’t look away from the “ugly, broken, sun-burned tangle of trunks” of trees that had shaded the forest floor for centuries. “Awesome” was the word he kept repeating.
Later, Finch offered this insight: “If life gives you a tornado, you make tornado research.”
So he made plans. His teams would repair roads, figure out how to remove downed trees if dangerous, and observe the long-term recovery processes hidden in the forest. The research, he said, could provide insights into forest resilience, species adaptation, and the role of natural disturbances in ecosystem dynamics.
The ruin was a fresh opportunity for Finch. Preserving Alabama’s diversity will help natural systems globally, he said. Biodiversity loss here can lead to cascading ecological, genetic, and economic consequences that reverberate far beyond Alabama’s borders.
This one last great wild place in Alabama can be protected, as Finch said, “not just as an asset to Alabama, but an asset to the whole country.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Paint-Rock-Forest-Research-for-July-29-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 08:56:17.283976

A new analysis found New Jersey has one of the nation’s largest unfunded liabilities for state employee pension plans. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

n comparison to a year earlier, the jobless rate also increased in all of those metro areas.
St. Joseph had the highest unemployment rate among all of the state’s metro areas in June, rising to 4.5% from 4% in May. The city’s unemployment rate was 4.2% a year before.
Columbia saw the highest monthly increase in its unemployment rate, which was 4.2% in June, up 0.7 percentage points from 3.5% in May.
Jefferson City had the state’s lowest unemployment rate at 3.7% in June.
Springfield and Kansas City had the same jobless rate in June at 4.2%, increasing from 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively, in May.
The statewide unemployment rate before seasonal adjustment in June was 4.4%, rising from 3.9% in May. The unemployment rate was 3.8% in June 2024.
Missouri’s total civilian labor force in June was 3.2 million, with about 140,946 unemployed.

LaMonica McIver's comments came with the release of a new report highlighting political representation by Black women.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver's comments came with the release of a new report highlighting political representation by Black women. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Rep. LaMonica McIver, whose first year in Congress has been marked by a federal indictment and a threat of censure by her Republican colleagues, said her time serving on the Newark City Council helped her develop the “tough skin” necessary to navigate her current political predicament.
McIver’s comments came as Rutgers officials unveiled a new report Thursday that charts a decade of data surrounding Black women’s representation in public offices, one that shows historic strides but a continued lack of representation at every level of government.
“City council and local government, it makes you tough … I’m up against a case that’s literally trying to throw me in jail. I have a situation where members of the other side of the aisle are trying to censure me, they’re trying to kick me off committees,” McIver said during a virtual briefing on the report. “That experience really gave me those, you know, tough lessons that is helping me today.”
Federal prosecutors in June hit McIver, a Democrat representing the 10th Congressional District, with a three-count indictment accusing her of assaulting federal officials and impeding the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat. The charges stem from a May 9 incident outside a migrant jail in Newark, when McIver and two other members of Congress attempted to enter the building for an inspection. A melee followed when federal agents attempted to arrest Baraka.
McIver and Baraka, whose federal trespassing charge was dropped days after his arrest, say the charges are political, as do their Democratic colleagues. The state’s chief federal prosecutor, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal attorney for Republican President Donald Trump, has pledged to use her office to “turn New Jersey red.”
McIver, who sat on the Newark City Council for six years and was its president when she was elected to Congress, on Thursday credited other Black women in Congress whom she said “hold me down.” McIver joined Congress in September 2024 after winning a special election to replace the late Rep. Donald Payne Jr. At 39, she’s one of the youngest members of Congress.
“We’re facing so many challenges, you know, each and every day to, you know, be serving in Congress, be serving at the federal level. Many of us have families. Many of us are wives. We’re trying to manage so much, but at the same time, we’re managing literally being targeted each and every day as well, on many different levels. And so the sisterhood has really been incredible,” she said.
Thursday’s report was produced by Rutgers’ Center for American Women and Politics and the Higher Heights Leadership Fund, a nonprofit aimed at boosting Black women in leadership roles. It found that while a record number of Black women now serve in state legislatures, only 25 Black women have ever held statewide elected executive office — in just 17 states — and none have ever been elected governor.
The report was released just one day after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she would not pursue the governorship of California, a decision that panelists described as representative of how Black women navigate power obstacles. Harris last year lost her bid for the White House to Trump.
“She believes that her current most powerful use of her voice, her time, talent, and treasures, is as someone not running for office and somebody not governing,” Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights, said.
Speakers on Thursday discussed the “Kamala effect,” the idea that Harris’s rise and representation at all levels of government have inspired Black women to greater political participation.
Since 2014, the number of Black women in statewide elected executive offices has grown from two to 10. In the 2024 election, 63% of Black women congressional nominees won their contests, outpacing the win rate of women candidates and men candidates, the report said.
Chelsea Hill, the report author and director of data at the Center for American Women and Politics, said that Harris’s presidential campaign revealed the obstacles that Black women face when running for elected offices.
“She confronted deeply entrenched gender, racial and intersectional stereotypes about her likability, her deservedness of the nomination and her ability to do the job,” Hill said.
There’s a status conference in McIver’s case scheduled for next week. A motion to censure her was introduced last week in the House by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-Louisiana). It says her actions on May 9 violated congressional rules that members “behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.”

There's more than enough to go around, and every little bit helps. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Paul Quackenbush: Don’t look away.","This commentary is by Paul Quackenbush, a resident of Burlington. 


Recently, as I exited the Ethan Allen Shopping Center on North Avenue in Burlington, I saw a woman on the sidewalk with three small children. She was trying to corral them away from the road as she held a sign that read “Every little bit helps.” I looked away. I told myself it was because I had a 10-year-old in the car, and I didn’t want him to see that situation or ask me difficult questions. 
The next day, I learned that more than 800 people — including nearly 300 children and 250 individuals with acute medical needs — were evicted when their motel vouchers ran out. The evictions came after Gov. Phil Scott initially vetoed a bill that would have regionalized the motel voucher program and then refused pleas to extend the vouchers — or even to set up emergency shelters for those leaving the program. They also came at a time when federal food assistance is drying up. Unsurprisingly, the downscale of the motel voucher program has been correlated with a steep rise in unsheltered homelessness in Vermont.

I thought of that mother and her kids again recently while I kayaked along the Lake Champlain shoreline, past multimillion-dollar homes that sit vacant for most of the year. I thought, too, of the poverty I had seen in many parts of a state that prides itself on its progressive values, like in Essex County, where the median annual income is less than $59,000 and more than 1 in every 6 children lives below the federal poverty line. 
My mind turned to what I could have done for that woman and her children. 
Maybe I should have stopped and bought them food and seen what I could do to help. Maybe I should have stayed better informed about the end of the motel housing voucher program so I could have contacted my representatives and Gov. Scott ahead of time to express my concerns. Maybe I should have worked harder to elect leaders who wouldn’t turn a blind eye toward the most vulnerable. And maybe I should have donated my time and money to one of the wonderful local organizations serving those in need. 
I still can.
One of the great things about living in the second least populous state is that each of us can have a relatively big impact. Many problems feel intractable right now, and it’s easy to point the finger at the powers and systems that be. 
But it’s our state, and those of us with enough can do a little more to make sure other Vermonters have enough too. There’s more than enough to go around, and every little bit helps.

Child care in Minnesota has been in crisis for years and now it is moving swiftly from crisis to collapse.
It is unaffordable for families, and yet we don’t have enough resources to pay our teachers living wages. We are losing child care programs every day, often ones that have been part of the fabric of our communities for decades, leaving families scrambling to find care. 
This spring St. Paul lost several child care centers: Hallie Q. Brown Early Learning Center, Sandcastle Early Learning Center, and Children’s Center Montessori. 
Children’s Country Day School is closing at the end of this summer. 
I’ve had too many conversations with other child care directors center around whether or not they will be able to stay open much longer.
When the Minnesota Legislature passed over $1 billion of funding for child care in 2023, it felt really big, but in reality it was far too little and far too late. Now, in 2025, with the federal government operating in the interest of billionaires at the expense of our family, friends, neighbors and — most importantly in my work — our children, we are left with no choice but to act boldly. 
You know what happens when we act boldly? We create amazing things, like Head Start. Head Start turned 60 years old this year — but what should be a joyous moment of celebration is instead a tenuous moment of fear and worry. 
Head Start has served over 40 million kids in its 60 years. We have spots for 38 of those children at Wilder Child Development Center, where I am the director. That’s over half of our enrollment. These are kids like Liam, who needs extra behavioral and mental health support after losing his father at a young age. He’s getting that support and thriving, and his mom can work full time without worrying about him. It is very clear that investing in our youngest at a young age works.
To meet the requirements of Head Start, and the needs of these children, we receive a “per diem” for every Head Start child. For us, that adds up to nearly $250,000 every year — about one-third of our entire budget.
The Trump administration has backed off their quest to eliminate Head Start, but it is little consolation, as they have also closed five of the regional Head Start offices with no notice and no instruction on what the programs served by those offices should do, leading to huge funding delays. Administrators are being forced to take out bank loans to make payroll. In what world is this ok?
More recently, the administration declared that Head Start should be reclassified as a “federal public benefit” which would slash eligibility of immigrant families by up to 500,000 children, while immediately impacting 115,000. This affects all of us. 
If we lose Head Start kids, we lose Head Start funding. If we lose that funding, we will have  to close at least one classroom, leading to loss of child care for 15-20 children, whether they are part of Head Start or not. Without that funding, we would have to let staff go. It is even possible that we would have to close our doors.
What I mean by acting boldly in this moment is taking action to ensure that if federal funding for child care is cut off, that we as a state have the resources we need to support the programs the federal government is choosing not to — because if they are coming for Head Start, they are surely coming for the federal grants that support our Child Care Assistance Program, too. 
Already, state agencies are struggling to draw down federal funds they use for child care and instead are met with an email from DOGE asking them to justify why they need the money. Considering that child care centers are closing every day because they can’t charge families enough to cover their expenses, this is beyond insulting.
Without funding, child care will cease to exist, thousands of parents will be unable to work, our economy will no longer function, and our kids will suffer greatly. 
Our children cannot wait, our families cannot wait, and we cannot wait. The time to act is now. We need our elected leaders in Minnesota to not just act, but to act boldly.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/D753AC86-F1DD-456D-BA50-EDD802758461-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 07:56:39.132251

Josh Hawley speaks to reporters at the governor's ham breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia on Aug. 15 , 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Recently, Missouri’s senior senator introduced the American Worker Rebate Act which promises “at least” $600 per adult and dependent child funded by revenue from President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. The proposed legislation represents a dangerous fiscal misstep that threatens to worsen inflation while squandering a rare opportunity to address America’s mounting debt crisis.
Hawley’s proposal goes against one of Our Republican Legacy’s five pillars — fiscal responsibility — which is being woefully overlooked by current Republicans.
Our Republican Legacy’s fiscal responsibility principle reads: “Historically, our party stood for fiscal responsibility. The explosion of national debt in recent years is a legacy of weakness that future Americans must inherit. We renew our historical commitment to a sound economy.”
Hawley’s proposed tariff rebate is an anathema to the very idea of fiscal responsibility and is an example of just how much the GOP has changed from what it used to be.
American workers deserve policies that genuinely improve their economic prospects, not Hawley’s political theater that provides temporary checks while imposing hidden long-term costs.
Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, and those costs are inevitably passed along to consumers through higher prices. Hawley’s rebate scheme will have American families paying higher prices at the store while receiving what amounts to their own money back—minus the administrative costs of collection and redistribution.
The inflationary risks of Hawley’s plan cannot be overstated. The U.S. has brought in a record $150 billion worth of tariff revenue so far, but that economic burden came directly from American consumers and businesses.
Rather than allowing this contractionary effect to help cool inflation, Hawley proposes pumping the tariff revenue directly back into consumer spending through cash payments. This creates a perfect storm for further price increases with tariffs driving up the cost of imported goods while rebate checks increase consumer demand, pushing prices higher across the board.
The Federal Reserve has spent the past few post-Covid years fighting to bring inflation under control, raising interest rates and implementing contractionary monetary policy to reduce demand pressures in the economy. Hawley’s rebate scheme would effectively counteract these efforts by providing fiscal stimulus precisely when the economy needs restraint.
For a family of four potentially receiving $2,400, the immediate gratification of cash payments would be quickly eroded by the resulting price increases on everything from groceries to housing.
Hawley’s tariff rebate plan offers an economic sugar rush mixed with short-term political gain at the expense of long-term economic stability.
As troublesome as the risk of inflation, Hawley’s proposal also misses a massive opportunity for debt reduction. With the national debt approaching dangerous levels and interest payments consuming an ever-larger share of federal revenues, the $150 billion in tariff collections could make a meaningful dent in our fiscal obligations.
Our Republican Legacy’s founder and former Sen. John Danforth had the following to say: “Hawley’s plan which, as I understand it, would give $600 to every man, woman and child in America, is the opposite of one of (Our Republican Legacy’s) core principles of fiscal responsibility. The current Republican program blows the lid off the national debt which now stands at $37 trillion and, under the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, will grow an additional $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years.”
Reducing the national debt would lower the government’s interest burden, freeing up resources for productive investments in infrastructure, education, and defense. It would also strengthen America’s fiscal position for future economic challenges and reduce the intergenerational burden we’re placing on young Americans. Every dollar spent on rebates today is a dollar not available for debt reduction, meaning higher taxes or reduced services for future generations.
Again, from Danforth: “As I understand Hawley’s proposal, that increase in the debt is not enough. He would increase it by an additional $200 billion in a one-time payment to all.”
Rather than fueling inflation through misguided stimulus, Congress should demonstrate genuine leadership by either repealing the tariffs, which is within their Constitutional powers, or apply the tariff revenue to debt reduction, providing lasting benefits for all Americans while avoiding the inflationary trap this proposal would create.
While it remains to be seen whether Hawley’s proposed legislation would ever become law, this isn’t the first time Hawley has embraced the idea of sending out checks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hawley was a lone Republican calling for additional rounds of stimulus checks back in 2020, even teaming up with democratic socialist, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.

(Getty Images)Watching successful programs disintegrate due to state budget cuts is particularly disheartening. Adding bypassing investment in other opportunities to that makes it downright depressing.
A widely supported dropout prevention program called Jobs for America’s Graduates was expanded under former Gov. Eric Holcomb, but has now lost all its state funding.
Similarly, the statewide initiative through Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library aimed at increasing literacy in Hoosier children is in peril after lawmakers removed it from the state budget. A private fundraising effort is ongoing, but its future is unclear.
These are ongoing programs that might fail.
On top of that, there are examples of initiatives that could be created or increased to improve the lives of Hoosiers.
For instance, at least 16 states have sales tax holidays for parents buying school supplies. It could save families a significant amount when you consider clothes, computers and other supplies needed.
Gov. Mike Braun proposed this holiday, which also would have covered youth sports purchases — even putting it in his draft budget. But other priorities won out and it was eventually removed.
Or what about actually increasing money going to food banks at a time when food insecurity is high? The budget maintained a $2 million line item but saw no increase despite food banks facing higher demand.
And I haven’t even mentioned the state employee layoffs that are happening. Recently the Indiana Department of Workforce Development laid off 15% of its workforce.
Impact on revenue
And I want to be clear about one thing. The state is still seeing increased tax collections — just not as robust as expected.
In fiscal year 2025, Hoosiers paid $22.2 billion in taxes — including sales, income, corporate, gaming, fuel and others. That was about $740 million more than the prior year.
50+ state employees laid off as Indiana budget cuts take effect

The problem is that some programs like Medicaid are growing so fast it squeezes out other worthy initiatives.
There is still wiggle room though. For instance, the state could afford both JAG and the Dolly Parton program.
Indeed, lawmakers created a Freedom and Opportunity in Education Fund and appropriated $50 million to it each year. It doesn’t direct the money to any specific programs, instead just outlining general uses such as improving academic performance, recruiting educators in high-need areas, expanding computer science programs, reading intervention and dropout prevention.
We will have to wait and see what the Indiana Department of Education and the Braun administration use that money for instead.
Tax cuts continue
Other initiatives — like eliminating the tax on adult diapers or feminine hygiene products — also can happen. But lawmakers instead continue to slowly reduce Indiana’s flat income tax rate, which means less money comes to the state.
Indiana’s individual income tax rate has dropped from 3.4% to 3.05% since 2015 via a phased-in reduction. And it’s scheduled to drop to 2.9% by 2027.
Indiana’s corporate income tax rate has also dropped.
For several years, when Indiana was swimming in new revenue and the state was plowing billions into new buildings, paying down unfunded pension obligations and incentivizing regional development, it made sense.
But that’s not the case anymore. And the tax cuts are happening at such an incremental pace that most Hoosiers don’t even realize it. Collectively, though, those dollars could be used to improve services, continue successful programs and generally invest in the future.
Of course no one likes paying taxes and it’s easy to support tax cuts. But I am curious what the ultimate goal is and whether lawmakers will ever admit a certain level of revenue is needed to move Indiana forward.

This bee was last documented in Washington in 1919. (Photo courtesy of the Washington Bee Atlas.)More than two dozen new and rare bee species were documented during the first year of a new Washington state project that’s designed to get a better understanding of the insects.
The Washington State Department of Agriculture is seeking new bee collection volunteers as its Bee Atlas initiative enters its second year. 
“We’re already learning fascinating things about our native bees, and we’re only getting started,” said Karen Wright, pollinator taxonomist for the Washington State Department of Agriculture. “But we still need more help. Washington is a large state and there are some counties where we don’t have a single volunteer. We’d love to have more people trained and out there looking for and recording our native bees.”
The Washington Bee Atlas is modeled after the Oregon Bee Atlas, which began in 2019 as part of the broader Pacific Northwest Bumble Bee Atlas. That program began in 2018 and monitors bumble bee activity in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. 
Washington remains part of the Pacific Northwest Bumble Bee Atlas, but launched the Washington Bee Atlas in July 2023 as part of an effort to better understand Washington’s native bees, identify which are doing well and which may need conservation support.
The Washington Bee Atlas also documents which plants native bees depend on, with the goal of developing recommendations for seed mixes to support pollinators. 
All of the latest bee data from Washington will be added to the Ecdysis research data portal, with plans for more ways to make the data usable by the public under discussion.
The Washington State Department of Agriculture began training program volunteers in 2023. 
Most bee collecting is done by volunteers trained to collect and pin museum-quality specimens and record the location and host plant where the bee was collected. The volunteers then submit the pinned specimens to Wright for identification. Eventually, all specimens not used for education and outreach will reside in the Washington State University entomology museum.
Aside from being over the age of 18, there are no prerequisites for new volunteers, as the program provides the necessary training.  
In 2024, 67 Washington Bee Atlas volunteers collected over 17,000 specimens on more than 600 different host plants. 
The project has identified at least 26 new or rare species in the state, with many of the collected bees yet to be identified.
The state Department of Agriculture said there have already been several remarkable discoveries, including 15 species never collected in the state before, a bee found in Yakima County that had not been recorded in Washington since 1917, and another bee found in Yakima and Pierce counties that had never previously been found in western Washington. 
Many of these bees were detected in central Washington, likely because most native bees have adapted to thrive in dry areas like the microclimates found east of the Cascade Mountains, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. 
Ten of the 26 new or rare bee species that have been identified so far were collected in Chelan County. 
Eight of those bee species collected in Chelan County were discovered as part of a graduate research project conducted by a University of Washington student and a Washington Bee Atlas volunteer.
A total of eight new or rare bee species were collected in Grant County, five in Yakima County, four in Kittias County, two in Okanogan County, and one each in Douglas, Thurston, Clark, Pierce and Benton counties. 
Some bee species were collected in more than one county. 
“These are just our preliminary findings,” Wright said. “There are still many more bees to identify from what has been collected, not to mention lots of opportunities to find new or rare species.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-2.13.03-PM-1024x590.png,,,2025-08-01 07:56:39.132251

(Getty Images)Despite having some of the most resources and economic support, a recent national study ranked Indiana’s early education system 42nd in the country — and second-to-last when it came to accessibility.
The WalletHub story, shared earlier this week, is simply the latest confirmation for Hoosier parents that Indiana’s child care market is struggling. Experts, business leaders and politicians agree that Indiana needs more child care, but can’t seem to agree on the best way to meet the moment. 
Report: state loses out on $4.2B annually due to child care shortage

Facing budgetary pressures and depressed revenue forecasts, state leaders opted to trim funding and narrow eligibility for early learning and child care resources earlier this year. Seats for state-funded preschool, known as On My Way Pre-K, have been halved while vouchers for subsidized child care have more 21,000 children on a waitlist.
One federal program, Head Start Indiana, hopes to help close the gap left by vanishing state funding, but faces its own challenges with flat federal funding. 
“We are the quietest, most successful 60-year old program in the federal government’s history,” boasted Rhett Cecil, the organization’s executive director. “… (our programs) are going to support their families and children. They’re allowing families to work or get job training or further education. And our services — that child care and early education — are free for those families.”
Just under 13,000 families in all 92 counties utilize the program, which receives roughly $181 million in federal funding annually. That budget line was briefly threatened by the Trump administration, which walked back proposed cuts in favor of flat funding — which does mean services will be lost as inflation and other costs eat into the bottom line. 
The second-term president also eliminated the federal Head Start office covering Indiana back in April — though the federal Administration for Children and Families announced it would dedicate one-time funding to Head Start locations earlier this week explicitly for nutrition, but not for other programming costs. 
Additional federal support could allow it to expand to meet the need following state cuts, leaders hope, and continue employing almost 4,000 Hoosiers.
“Let’s say, hypothetically, we get $100 million more dollars. How many more teachers and classrooms could be opened?” Cecil mused. “How many kids could we serve off that waitlist?”
 Importance of child care

Participating in and access to child care resources reaps benefits for young Hoosiers, such as better school readiness skills. Some national research has found that early education may also decrease future crime and could generate $7.30 for every one dollar invested.  
In Indiana, the shortage of child care options costs the state an estimated $4.2 billion annually, over a quarter of which is linked to annual tax revenue lost. 
The 2024 study from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce emphasized the need to free up parents, mostly women, who’ve left the workforce “as a direct result of childcare-related issues.” 
“There’s some data out there that one in four Hoosier parents leave their job over child care gaps, and it really impacts talent and workforce,” said David Ober, the chamber’s vice president of taxation and public finance. “It’s hindering economic momentum in the state and so it is a huge deal for us.” 
For the last few years, tackling the state’s child care crisis has been a top legislative priority for the organization, which represents the interests of thousands of Hoosier employers. Ober said the chamber is working to plan a child care summit later this year to identify potential solutions.
According to Brighter Futures Indiana, average full-time weekly care costs families $181 per week — with even higher prices for infants and toddlers. That doesn’t factor in type of care or quality, and prices vary by community.

Families can spend more on their young children’s care than on a college education — if it’s even available in their communities. Rather than pay the price, many Hoosier parents simply drop out of the workforce at the same time that employers are scrambling to hire talent. 
Ober highlighted recent legislative efforts to expand child care, including one that expanded a tax credit for employers directly providing their employees with child care resources. Other bills have tweaked staffing ratios and created a pilot program for so-called microcenters. 
But workforce remains a challenge, even for Head Start centers, earning its own legislative study carveout. Over 20% of Indiana’s child care workers left the field during the pandemic — a shock that “has not really fully healed,” Ober said. 
“If you ask any provider in the state, workforce is the hardest problem,” Ober said. “… How do you get educators and keep them? There’s so much more work to be done there and it’s challenging.”
Traditional market forces struggle to balance affordability for parents against costs for child care, a gap sometimes covered by government subsidies. 
But Ober insisted that “child care is infrastructure,” especially for the businesses reliant upon employees who are parents. Changing funding is “going to just exacerbate underlying problems,” he added.
“Those numbers are pretty stark,” Ober said. “And then when you add in changes at the state and the federal level, it creates new problems that we all have to come together and work on,” he concluded.

(Photo by  NIAID, National Institute of Health via Flickr | CC-BY-SA 2.0)Once again Montana is in the news for confirmed cases of West Nile Virus scattered across the state.  While no one seems to making the connection, one might credibly wonder how the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks’ approval of a new private pond every working day of the year plays into the proliferation of this disease.  And once again, no one is talking about that.
West Nile Virus is carried by Culex mosquitoes and infects both humans and livestock.  The virus has now been found in Lewis and Clark, Cascade, Sheridan, Custer, and Daniels Counties.  As reported by the Daily Montanan: “Illness caused by West Nile Virus can vary significantly in severity,” said Department of Public Health and Human Services Vectorborne Disease Epidemiologist Devon Cozart. “Although some people may not experience any symptoms at all, many people experience the onset of flu-like symptoms such as body aches and fatigue that may persist for weeks to months. Severe, neurological cases of West Nile Virus also occur every year in Montana, which may lead to death or permanent disability like blindness or paralysis. Don’t take a chance; prioritize avoiding mosquito bites whenever possible.”  
If the fact that “severe, neurological cases of West Nile Virus occur every year in Montana” caught your eye, you have good reason to be concerned since there is no vaccine or targeted medication for the virus in humans.
While the precautions issued by the Department of Public Health and Human Services suggest not getting bitten by mosquitoes is a priority, for most people, especially children, that is an impossibility for anyone spending time outdoors — which most Montanans do in summer. 
The other suggestion is to “Drain standing water around the house to prevent mosquito breeding.”  And therein lies the rub. 
While it’s fine for people to make sure there’s no standing water around their homes, the fact is mosquitoes breed in “standing water” — and that includes the proliferation of private ponds now spreading across Montana like, well, West Nile Virus. 
More than a coincidence?  
Hardly.  
Nothing says “standing water” like a pond which, unlike rivers and streams, are generally not flowing water.  Some may have an inlet, but many are now being filled with groundwater or even pumped in water and the exchange rate between inflow and outflow is very low.  Likewise, water temperatures tend to be higher than naturally flowing rivers and streams, which is why many ponds are now being stocked with warmwater species such as bass.
Although the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks produces Environmental Assessments before issuing the pond permits, suffice it to say they are generally very superficial and primarily concerned with the species of hatchery fish to be stocked in the pond.  
Even though ponds are supposed to be certified by the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to ensure they have the water rights to fill them, many of the environmental assessments lack even that basic documentation — and water rights in Montana are a hot topic right now.
With Montana’s rapidly warming climate it’s only a matter or time before we can expect to see not only more West Nile Virus, but a host of other insect-transmitted diseases spreading north. 
When considering the significant evaporative loss of ponds, the potential for human, livestock, and aquatic disease transmission, and the inevitable march of a hotter, drier climate it’s hard to find state approval of a private pond every day as prudent public policy — and one might just wonder why the state continues to do so without considering all the potential effects.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/53011360208_c743df9991_o-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-08-01 06:56:35.348329

(Photo by Karla Brizuela/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Tens of thousands of students have received financial literacy and career readiness training through a new Oklahoma City program designed to simulate real-world experience.
Since the nonprofit center launched in October, students as young as fourth grade have translated the lessons they’ve learned in the classroom to age-appropriate real-world scenarios such as how to budget or run a business.
The idea to create the specialized programs came from the realization that students lacked essential business and financial skills, said Edward Pope, regional director of Junior Achievement of Oklahoma, the group leading the effort. 
“We realized students did not have the appropriate knowledge, and so we wanted to create a nonprofit that would help students learn about business and learn how to conduct them,” Pope said.
Oklahoma lawmakers require students in grades seventh to 12th to demonstrate a “satisfactory knowledge level” of 14 financial literacy topics before they graduate. Those topics include the importance of work and budgeting, balancing a checkbook, saving and investing, and the consequences of bankruptcy.
Supporters of the program said that they developed two distinct programs designed to align with Oklahoma’s financial literacy graduation requirements and state standards. There are now two of these centers in Oklahoma. The other is located in Tulsa.

The newest center, located in northwest Oklahoma City, connects volunteers with students to teach them how to navigate real-world financial and business scenarios.
BizTown, which is designed for elementary students, teaches students how to manage a business in a simulated town.
It merges skills learned in the classroom with a visit to an imitation town where students practice the skills they’ve learned in the classroom, learn how to keep their own checkbook, read a paycheck and work a simulated job. Students take on jobs roles within storefronts sponsored by local companies.
The experience gives students a chance to earn and spend money while practicing communication and collaboration, Pope said. 
Finance Park is geared toward high school students. It focuses on personal budgeting and long-term financial planning. Students begin by choosing a career path and education level, and then they navigate adult decisions such as marriage, housing, child care and transportation.
Pope said the students progress through three or four life stages. At the end, they find out if they met their financial goals, he said.
Both pathways are free to schools across the state, and over 250 schools have arranged field trips to the center. Supporters said over 4,000 people have volunteered at the center since its launch last year. Over 80% of its funding to pay for the programming comes from several hundred corporate sponsors.
During the 2023–24 school year, Pope said an analysis of the programs show they reached 59,367 students and resulted in over 860,000 contact hours. Over 90% of program participants said the trainings either increased their confidence about joining the workforce or helped set them on a path to set financial goals.
The organization said that number grew to more than 62,000 students during the 2024-25 school year, and the organization said it worked with 270 schools in 96 districts and 1,200 teachers.
Norman teachers Wanda Dyer and Lynndi Cox, who teach at Irving Middle School, said they both incorporate the programs into their classrooms.
Dyer said the center enables her to create engaging modules by combining group activities, personal finance lessons and career exploration exercises.
“They’ve practiced balancing budgets, thinking through life decisions, and identifying career goals,” Dyer said. “By the time they go to the simulation, they’re not just guessing — they’re making informed choices.” 
She believes introducing students to the program in eighth grade helps them start thinking about careers before entering high school. 
“They can go ahead and start working and have a game plan,” she said.
Cox said some of her students didn’t even know certain jobs existed before visiting the center.
“It gives them options outside the traditional academic path and shows them how their interests can translate into careers,” she said.
Rachel Kanady, senior vice president at NFP, an Aon company, and a Junior Achievement board member, said the center’s age-specific curriculum is able to be adjusted as needed to meet the needs of students and the state.
“Our curriculum is designed to engage students at the right age level, aligning with what they’re learning in school,” she said.
Pope, the regional director, said the center hopes to grow and impact more students.
“As more schools and volunteers get involved, the hope is that even more students across the state will leave better prepared for life after graduation,” he said.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.

The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.
The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma schools find themselves in a challenging position, suddenly caught in the middle of the Trump administration’s push to deport illegal immigrants.
Schools have found themselves at the forefront of immigration debates before, but this feels different.
They face so many more challenges ranging from the threat of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids to decreasing attendance rates as families choose to keep their children home to avoid the trauma associated with them. The Trump administration has withheld funding for school programs, including migrant education and services for English language learners. And State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ policies, such as trying to require schools to collect data on the immigration status of students, are further destabilizing our education system.
This isn’t the first time I’ve attended OK Justice Circle’s Breaking Bread panel and group discussions. This panel has met 14 times since 2020 in order to “increase community awareness of the lived experiences of racial and ethnic minorities in Oklahoma City area.”
The latest Breaking Bread topic, which focused on the harm state and federal policies are causing to our state’s Hispanic community, was the most emotional one I’ve ever attended during the last five years.
For instance, as a panelist was leaving for the conference, a student told her that she is studying the Holocaust and could see parallels forming between that horrific event that ultimately resulted in the deaths of 6 million Jewish people and the ramping up of our country’s immigration enforcement efforts.
An elected school board member, who represents a majority Hispanic district, reported receiving death threats.
Another urban district reported seeing an alarming surge in absenteeism.
I heard stories about how students now come to school every day with their birth certificates in their backpacks just in case ICE raids their schools. I can’t remember the last time a child had to prove they were an American citizen while in school.
These raise tough questions about what schools can do to protect the students they’re entrusted to serve.
Schools cannot politicize the issues they deal with, but they can help provide “wrap-around services” like increased access to food and or solutions to housing insecurity. They can also address the physical and mental health issues their students are experiencing. And, they can refer students to nonprofit and public agencies that have support structures.
But those solutions require trust in the law and the procedures that ICE agents are required to follow. It is really difficult to trust the immigration enforcement process right now.
The Trump administration held funding for English language services. I worry that federal leaders could one day try to take it even a step further by denying access to public school to undocumented children.
That would inflict incredible hardships on families and untold amounts damage on our state’s social and economic future.
Fortunately, Rep. Arturo Alonzo-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, gave me some reason for hope. Over 20 anti-immigration bills were introduced to the Legislature this year, but only one became law.
Only time will tell if the majority of Oklahomans can find the courage to push back on the policies that are causing immeasurable harm to our Hispanic neighbors.
I often find myself wondering, what would it say about Oklahomans and our integrity if we did not stand up and reject today’s cruelty?

“I think it needs some more work,” committee co-chair and Casper Republican Sen. Jim Anderson said after several hours of expert testimony and public comment. “I think we’ve got five months to work it to see if we really can change some minds in Wyoming to work this bill.”
It’s unclear whether the committee might still consider sponsoring the draft bill, “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” during the 2026 budget session. Though some members expressed support for holding a third interim hearing, the committee didn’t commit to it.
The panel heard from approximately two dozen residents who, collectively, appeared split on the issue. But sentiment tilted toward the notion that lawmakers are simply moving too quickly to change state law to accommodate Radiant Industries, which plans to manufacture nuclear microreactors near the town of Bar Nunn and store spent fuel from the units at the facility.

“We don’t have to be the first,” Bar Nunn resident Laura Redmond told the committee, noting that Radiant would be among the earliest in the nation to mass-manufacture portable microreactors for military and commercial use around the world. “We can let other [states] make the mistakes, and we can capitalize on that.”
Will Almas of Lander, who has experience in the nuclear energy industry, said he generally believes the advancing nuclear microreactor industry is safe, along with federal oversight of waste facilities. However, “I can’t wholeheartedly endorse the project,” he said.
Radiant is scheduled to test its Kaleidos microreactor design at the Idaho National Laboratory next year, Almas noted. Lawmakers should consider waiting until after the test, he suggested, before changing the law. Meantime, he suggested officials organize a public engagement effort throughout the state — preferably hosted by a neutral third party — to help gain trust in the actual benefits and risks before determining whether Wyomingites want to welcome the industry here.
“We’re not comfortable with risks that we don’t understand and that are new,” Almas said. “I think that’s part of what’s going on here, is that [residents] just don’t know how to evaluate that risk.”
Not everyone embraced such nuance or a wait-and-evaluate attitude.

Several residents and industry proponents suggested Wyoming is in a race with other states to capitalize on what they see as a burgeoning and lucrative industry, and one that has enthusiastic backing from the Trump administration. Many others were dead-set against the industry and, in particular, storing nuclear waste near Bar Nunn or anywhere in the state.
“Why would we amend state statute for a company not in the business of storing spent fuel, knowing we are taking on all the risk and responsibility for the unforeseeable future,” Bar Nunn resident Lee-Ann Newquist said, noting there is no permanent federal repository and that any “temporary” storage in Wyoming would likely become permanent.
Bar Nunn, an industrial yet quiet community of 3,000 a few miles north of Casper, is like living in “Mayberry,” Newquist said, referring to the idyllic American small-town portrayed in The Andy Griffith Show. But the town has become polarized since Radiant’s plans were announced.
“Now, many of us pass each other without eye contact or even acknowledgement, and any mention of ‘nuclear’ is like pouring gasoline on a fire,” Newquist said, adding that opponents of the proposal are often ridiculed. “We’re continually belittled, told our emotions are notwithstanding, that we’re fear-mongering and stupid.”
Rush to nuclear?
The draft bill is the third legislative attempt within a year to add exceptions to Wyoming’s decades-long ban on storing nuclear fuel waste. 
A similar piece of legislation, Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” was defeated during this year’s legislative session. Lawmakers also rejected House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” earlier this year, which would have opened Wyoming’s doors to decades of nuclear waste that’s been accumulating at the nation’s nuclear power plants.

Lawmakers have already made one exception to the state’s ban on nuclear waste storage, however. 
House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” was passed in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.
Skeptics of expanding waste storage exemptions to nuclear microreactor manufacturers note that it’s a significant departure from storing nuclear waste at TerraPower’s Natrium plant. Specifically, Radiant’s business model is to ship its 1-megawatt Kaleidos microreactors to clients all over the nation and the world, according to the company. All the units would eventually be shipped back to Radiant’s manufacturing campus near Bar Nunn for refueling and redeployment, vastly increasing the chances of an accident en route, many worry.
Several times during the hearing, residents questioned whether elected officials — state, local and federal — are actually listening to their concerns. Many were particularly frustrated at Wednesday’s hearing.
Dozens of residents showed up by 9:30 a.m., anticipating the beginning of the nuclear waste discussion on the agenda. But the committee didn’t get to public comment until late in the afternoon, and when it did, Chairman Anderson wanted to hear from other state-elected officials first, drawing ire from committee member and Cheyenne Republican Sen. Tara Nethercott.
“This is a new practice of the Wyoming Legislature to allow legislators to dominate the conversation from ‘We the people,'” Nethercott said. “The purpose of the public meeting is to hear from you [addressing the audience], because I can hear from my colleagues all the time. So I just want to caution us from pontificating a little too much about our opinions on the topic, and rather hear from those that don’t have access to us as frequently in this public forum.”

The streaks of light and shadow that often accompany Equality State sunrises and sunsets have a name — crepuscular rays.
The post Wyoming’s twilight highlights appeared first on WyoFile .","The streaks of light and shadow that often accompany Wyoming sunrises and sunsets have a name — crepuscular rays.
Stemming from the Latin “crepusculum,” meaning twilight, the sunbeams can appear at any time of day, but are most noticeable as the sky changes at dawn or dusk, as photographed on Tuesday evening in Laramie. 
Sunlight shooting through gaps in clouds or other features of the horizon causes the optical phenomenon, while tiny particles like dust, water vapor or pollen, suspended in the air, scatter the light, making it visible to our eyes. 
Though the beams appear to fan outward from the sun, crepuscular rays are parallel. It’s similar to how lines on a highway or railroad tracks appear to narrow in the distance. 
The next time you spot crepuscular rays, turn your back to the sunset for a chance to see a more elusive phenomenon. Though less vibrant, anticrepuscular rays appear in the opposite direction of the sun and can give the effect of the horizon being cut in half, visible in the photo below.

Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) and Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) said in a cosponsorship memo that[...],"A health care provider bandages a child after giving a vaccination shot. (Photo by Scott Housely/CDC)A pair of Wisconsin Republicans want to increase awareness of the state’s vaccine exemptions by requiring waiver forms be given to parents with the health forms they receive from schools and child care center providers. 
Coauthors of the bill Rep. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) and Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) said in a cosponsorship memo that there is a “lack of transparency” around the exemptions that “can create confusion and unnecessary barriers for parents” and “increase administrative burden on schools when immunization documentation is incomplete or delayed.” 
Wisconsin law requires children in elementary, middle, junior or senior high school, a child care center, or a nursery school to get vaccinated for various diseases based on their grade or age. The vaccine and booster schedule covers mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis and tetanus. 
Wisconsin allows parents to get the requirement waived if they submit a written statement objecting for reasons including health, religious or personal conviction. 
Lawmakers noted that the bill would not change current requirements for vaccines. The bill would require schools, child care centers and nursery schools to create a process to present a vaccine waiver form with each health-related form it requires before a student can be enrolled.
“Many parents are unaware of this right or are unclear about how to obtain that waiver and feel pressured to make medical decisions for their children that they otherwise would not have,” Brill said in a statement. “This bill ensures that schools make parents aware of the rights already afforded them by Wisconsin law and include information about the waiver from the vaccine requirement and a procedure for presenting it in any required pre-enrollment health-related forms.”
The proposal comes as Wisconsin’s vaccination rates have not caught up with pre-pandemic levels. According to a 2024 U.S. Centers for Disease Control report, Wisconsin is falling behind other states in childhood immunizations for illnesses including polio, pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus, and measles, mumps and rubella. 
The decline in vaccine rates is partially to blame for diseases, including measles and pertussis, increasing across the country, according to health officials. 
According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, 86.4% of students met the minimum immunization requirements during the 2024-25 school year — a 2.8 percentage-point decrease from the prior year. The agency also reports that 6.7% of students had a waiver for one or more immunizations, representing a 0.6 percentage-point increase from last year, though the number of students waiving all vaccines fell to 1.3%. 
Amid falling rates, DHS officials have ramped up efforts to encourage vaccinations to help improve effectiveness. 
Wisconsin has one of the lowest measles vaccination rates in the country, with only Alaska falling below it. One dose of the MMR vaccine, which fights measles, provides approximately 93% protection, while two doses are about 97% effective.
As measles vaccine rates have fallen, cases of the highly contagious disease have hit the highest level in 33 years, according to the CDC with 1,288 cases this year. More than 150 people have been hospitalized from measles, and three people have died this year. No cases have been reported in Wisconsin so far, but its neighboring states, including Illinois and Minnesota, have had cases.
The lawmakers’ efforts to increase awareness of vaccine exceptions comes amid a national wave of skepticism to vaccination, including from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is a leading and prominent vaccine skeptic and was appointed by President Donald Trump this year. 
Brill thanked Kennedy for his work on his “Make America Health Again” agenda in her statement about the bill.
Cabral-Guevara, a board certified family nurse practitioner, has supported legislation that would loosen vaccine requirements before including a 2024 bill that would have allowed immunization exemptions at higher education institutions without documentation. 
The bill passed the Senate and Assembly, but was vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers, who said in a veto message that he objected to “the Wisconsin State Legislature’s efforts to micromanage decisions to respond to public health incidents and restrict existing tools available to higher education institutions to keep students, faculty, staff safe and healthy on their campuses.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With little discussion, Tennessee’s Building Commission approved a no-cost lease Thursday for state property near the Capitol for Elon Musk’s Boring Company to launch its tunneling project.
A few logistical questions are: Where are they going first, what about the potential environmental impact and who owns all the rock? Will the state give up its mineral rights?
Critics of the project also want to know why the state is giving away property – on top and under the ground – to a billionaire without a public vetting? 
“Why are we rushing this process? What’s the hurry? Why don’t we have an impact study? Because we’re dealing with a billionaire?” D.J. Porter asked the group of state officials.
Despite opposition from a packed room, the Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee approved the lease of a parking lot on nearly an acre deemed to be surplus property at 637 Rosa Parks Blvd., just down the hill on the southwest side of the State Capitol, where the boring machine could start digging. 
Are they headed next to the Capitol and Music City Center, up and down Broadway and then to the airport? The plan calls for using zero-emissions electric vehicles to ferry people from one station to another, a plan that critics said will only help Musk’s companies transport tourists, not Nashvillians.
Department of General Services Commissioner Jeff Holmes told the panel the state secured a line of credit from Boring in case it abandons the tunneling project. The company also obtained a license to work at the parking lot where it already put up a construction fence.

State officials are playing it close to the vest, though the lease of the Rosa Parks property makes it pretty clear where the tunnel could start. After all, they’ve got to dig a hole somewhere to go underground.
Committee members didn’t make themselves available for questions or declined to talk to reporters after Thursday’s meeting.
Everything’s running through Gov. Lee, who called it the “coolest” project he’s introduced in his two terms.
The Governor’s Office this week announced the start of a public process to “evaluate potential routes, engage stakeholders and finalize plans for the project’s first 10-mile phase.” With that in mind, it doesn’t appear the first part of the “Music City Loop” will start at the convention center south of Broad and go to the airport, only that it will connect those at some point with an eight-minute transit time using underground tunnels beneath state-owned roads.
State Sen. Becky Massey told the Lookout this week the state will sign a long-term lease with the Boring Company, enabling it to build the tunnel on or under state right of way.
What happens with the extracted rock remains to be seen, since the state holds mineral rights to everything under its above-ground right of way, to the center of the Earth. Will the state require Boring to pay for the limestone it removes, or will it give up those rights as part of a long-term lease? Will the state use the rock to build roads? 
Considering this is being called a public-private partnership, what is the state’s role, other than providing the land, and how does it benefit? Few answers are being supplied as this deal steams down the track. 
Education leader zaps feds

Tennessee’s education commissioner inadvertently gigged the Trump administration’s handling of federal funds for public education this week, saying it’s still getting its “sea legs.”
The U.S. Department of Education initially withheld billions of dollars from states but then reversed course and released the money, giving states some modicum of relief as students return to school in August.
Asked this week if she would like to see more consistent policy from the federal level, Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds told reporters the state hasn’t gone through a full year yet with the Trump Administration but she expects improvement.
“I think they’re getting their sea legs underneath them and trying to figure out all the landscape. I think once the appointees get confirmed, I think there’ll be a lot more consistency,” Reynolds said. “So I think that’s kind of been a little bit of a holdup. Get the people in there that understand public education and can help support states. Not that they don’t support public education. … That kind of came out wrong.”
We know what she means, since that’s what many people are thinking but afraid to say out loud.
Reynolds spoke to reporters after a meeting of the legislature’s Federal Education Deregulation Cooperation Task Force, possibly one of the longest committee names in state history, which is supposed to figure out how to handle a major reduction.
Tennessee receives $1.3 billion in education funding from the federal government, mainly for nutrition, disadvantaged students, disabled children, extended learning, teacher instruction, career and technical education, English language learnings and rural and low-income schools.
Tennessee’s Republican leaders have wanted to eliminate the federal education department for years. Reynolds and her staff complained in Tuesday’s hearing that the department is inundated with paperwork to satisfy the feds.
Reynolds told lawmakers they’d like to receive the federal money in a block grant, or lump sum, and disburse it to their liking. Yet the department wouldn’t cut staff, only repurpose their work.
Even though many lawmakers have spent months and years blasting the U.S. Education Department, Republican state Sen. Bill Powers of Clarksville told the group he assumed the release of funds was a “breath of fresh air across the state of Tennessee. … It was for my district.”
Later, Powers said the federal Education Department is in “a state of flux,” but he added, “when the edict comes down from on high,” the state is prepared to handle it.
It’s still unclear, though, whether Tennessee would be able to handle the shortfall if the feds pull back the money, possibly next year.  
Asked that question by committee Chair Dawn White of Murfreesboro, education officials said they would have to “get back with you.”
Working on teacher license
Commissioner Reynolds admitted to reporters this week she still doesn’t hold a teacher license, even though state law requires the state’s education leader to be qualified to teach at the highest grade over which she has authority.
“I work on it on weekends, and I do my best,” Reynolds said.
Tennessee education commissioner remains under the microscope

The department’s new spokesperson, Maggie Hannan cut off the conversation, more or less ending Reynolds’ first interview with Capitol press corps members in, well, maybe ever.
Following Reynolds’ appointment by Gov. Lee, Democrats said in early 2024 she was unqualified to hold the job because she wasn’t licensed to teach in K-12 here.
Reynolds enrolled in a teacher education program at UT-Martin and received a tuition waiver before she had been with the state department the required six months, after signing an affidavit stating she was eligible for the money. Reynolds reportedly repaid the money after questions arose.
Reynolds pushed the governor’s private-school vouchers, a new program that gives $7,000 to 20,000 students in its first year to enroll in private schools, regardless of whether they attended public or private schools the previous year.
After going head-to-head in 2024 with critics of the proposal, Reynolds rarely, if ever, visited committee hearings this year. Lawmakers narrowly passed the $146 million program, and the Education Department is continuing to enroll applicants until July 31, less than a week before school starts.
Likewise, Reynolds is running out of time to earn her teaching license. Gov. Lee’s second term will run out in early 2027. Will she get the license before then, or is this an exercise in futility?
Public at last
The Registry of Election Finance released a document this week showing the Professional Board of Responsibility dismissed a complaint against Nashville attorney Cynthia Sherwood. The release came nearly two weeks after the Lookout requested a copy of the letter.
Bill Young, leader of the Registry, which oversees the state’s campaign finances, filed the complaint last fall after Sherwood sent a private investigator to his home to question him. Young declined to speak to the PI because Sherwood’s client, Cade Cothren, has pending cases before the Registry. Young is represented by staff counsel and the state Attorney General’s Office in the case.
Tennessee board clears attorney in ethics complaint from state campaign finance watchdog

Registry board members said the incident was an ethical violation and voted to send a complaint to the Board of Professional Responsibility.
In early July, the board sent the letter to Young stating, “Our inquiry has not revealed sufficient evidence to proceed against the attorney (Sherwood) for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.” Dismissal of the case was approved and set to become final in 30 days, absent a written appeal.
During the Registry board’s July meeting, the dismissal letter was considered closed to the public. Registry members asked the AG’s Office for an opinion on whether it should be a public record. 
Sherwood later provided a copy of a letter she received on the case’s dismissal to the Lookout.
By the time the board meets again in September, the question could be moot. But the Registry board probably won’t be happy with the case’s dismissal.
Not so tough
A Nashville Criminal Court judge ordered former state Rep. Jeremy Durham to serve seven days in jail for DUI after suspending most of a year-long sentence, the Tennessee Journal reported.
The attorney for Durham, a Franklin Republican, requested a lighter penalty that would allow him to serve 48 hours at a Rutherford County facility where offenders can pay for better digs than jail.

The former rep hit a car just off Broadway in Nashville late one night, then tried to run from police. He was charged with felony reckless endangerment, DUI, resisting arrest and unlawful use of drug paraphernalia.
Apparently, he tried to get out of the arrest that night by telling police he was an attorney and former legislator. That didn’t help his cause.
Judge Jennifer Smith called the situation “egregious” and questioned whether Durham appreciated the “gravity of it,” according to the report.
Durham must have failed to mention he was expelled from the House in 2016 for not-so-exemplary behavior toward more than 20 women who worked in the legislature. But who’s counting?

A new analysis found New Jersey has one of the nation’s largest unfunded liabilities for state employee pension plans. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”

For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
 State regulations

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.

The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

However the board ultimately deadlocked on the summary language, unable to find a middle ground on language detailing how the amendment would impact small business owners and whether the proposal can guarantee funds are used for specific investments into schools. 
While the board previously approved language for the Invest in MI Kids initiative at its June 27 meeting, procedural issues resulted in the board rescinding its approval, sending the initiative back to the beginning of the process. 
The initial summary presented to the board on Thursday used the same language they approved in June. However, the board was split with Vice Chair Mary Ellen Gurewitz and Canvasser Heather Cummings, both Democrats, in support of reapproving the previous language, while Board Chair Richard Houskamp and Canvasser Paul Cordes argued they should alter the summary in light of Thursday’s testimony. 
“We approved the summary. And now everybody who doesn’t like the summary wants, as Ms. Cummings says, they want a second bite at the apple, and I don’t think we should give it to them,” Gurewitz said.

The Invest in MI Kids coalition is proposing a 5% “fair share surcharge”on individual filers making more than $500,000 and over $1 million for joint filers, with the coalition arguing the effort would address $4 billion to $5 billion of underfunding Michigan schools. 
However, business groups from throughout the state argued before the board that the effort would amount to a graduated income tax and would bring harm to small businesses owners.
“Many small businesses are organized as S corps, LLCs, partnerships and sole proprietors, which means they claim business income on their individual income tax. And this proposal narrows in on that specifically,” said Kelli Saunders, vice president of policy and engagement for the Small Business Association of Michigan. “The $500,000- $1 million reportings are not their take home pay. Small business owners must leave earnings in the business for hiring, expanding salary and benefit packages, cost increases, capital expenditures and normal increases in day to day operations to keep the doors open.” 
Anne Kuhnen, Kids Count policy director for the Michigan League for Public Policy, said the proposal would raise over $1.5 billion in revenue to help educate the future workforce, emphasizing that the tax would be applied to individuals, not businesses.
“The surcharge applies to all income an individual taxpayer earns from salaries, gambling or lottery winnings, investments, capital gains, spousal incomes and businesses, as well as other eligible sources. But it is not a business tax.…This surcharge also does not enact a graduated income tax. Instead, it proposes a new separate tax at a simple flat rate,” Kuhnen said.

While the amendment would require money from the additional tax go toward classrooms in local school districts, including funding for career and technical education, attracting and retaining high-quality educators and reducing class sizes, Brian Shoaf, vice president of Public Policy and business advocacy at the Detroit Regional Chamber, argued the Legislature and the governor have the final say over how these funds are spent. 
State Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) disagreed, offering her opinion as a lawmaker and former chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on School Aid and Education that the Legislature could not spend that money for any other purpose than what is outlined in the amendment language.
In hopes of breaking the deadlock, Steve Liedel, attorney for Invest in MI Kids, offered to meet with Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater and Eric Doster, attorney for Small Business for Better Michigan, which is opposing the effort, with Brater drafting a new summary based on the conversation. 
Not included in the conversation was Daniel Ziegler, an attorney representing the opposing Coalition to Stop the Business and Family Tax Hike, who objected to his exclusion.  
However, the new proposal language, and the subsequent tweaks made to the summary were not enough to bring the board into agreement. With Gurewitz bringing a vote to approve the revised petition summary, the board voted on  party lines, failing to approve the language.
However, the board did vote to approve the form of the constitutional amendment. With that approval, Molly Sweeney, organizing director of 482Forward, a member of the ballot proposal coalition, said the plan is to move forward and distribute the petitions using the language previously approved by the board and presented by Brater earlier in the meeting. 
“We’re going to make sure it gets through and we believe the law’s on our side. We have an approved petition, we have an approved form, and we’re ready to go,” Sweeney said. 
While petitioners can ask the director of elections to prepare a summary to be approved or rejected by the board, they are not required to use that summary. However, a summary approved by the Board cannot be challenged on the grounds that it is misleading or deceptive.
Regardless, Liedel dismissed any concerns that the effort would not be permitted to move forward under the previously approved summary. 
In order to make the ballot in 2026, Invest MI Kids will need to gather 446,198 signatures within 180 days to be placed on the statewide ballot in the 2026 election.
However, Houskamp told reporters that if the matter does make the ballot, the next battle over this petition will likely involve the ballot summary language. 
In addition to arguing the proposal cannot truly require the Legislature to spend funds raised by the amendment in specific ways and that the matter amounts to a graduated income tax, Houskamp also took issue with placing tax policy directly into the Michigan Constitution, where it cannot easily be altered. 
“The 1,000-word summary doesn’t mean anything at the end of the day. The trouble is, if you catch somebody standing in front of the library and you read that 100-word summary, that makes it sound like this is a great deal. You flip it over and read the petition, and you really read it, well, yeah, it’s got a couple flies in it. And I think that those little issues with that petition are not little issues. I think they’re major issues,” Houskamp said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4189-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 06:56:35.348329

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

But her claim — that the attorney general’s office was the first in the country to file a state lawsuit against opioid manufacturers for the crisis — isn’t true. 
A June 2001 West Virginia case filed against Purdue Pharma and Abbott Laboratories predated the lawsuit she’s been referring to — a December 2015 suit filed by the office of Fitch’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Hood, against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and other companies that made opioid pills. 
Fitch has been making the claim about her office since at least 2021, touting the agency’s role in addressing overdose deaths that followed drug companies misrepresenting the danger and addictiveness of opioid painkillers.

Fitch, a Republican, has used the claim to ask local governments to join the lawsuits as plaintiffs and to advertise her work to secure more dollars for the state. 
The West Virginia case, which ended in 2004 with a $10 million settlement, is cited by archivists as the first lawsuit against opioid manufacturers for their roles in the 21st century addiction epidemic. 
Kate Tasker, director of the University of California San Francisco library maintaining lawsuit records related to the crisis, said the West Virginia case is the first one her library knows about. 
When Mississippi Today reached out to Fitch’s office about the miscategorization, spokesperson MaryAsa Lee said it was the case’s unique approach that set it apart from previous lawsuits.

“Mississippi’s lawsuit – the first to sue 16 opioid manufacturers – was the first of its kind, and within 3 years, 32 other states followed our model, which ultimately brought the injunctive and monetary relief that is helping us recover from the opioid epidemic,” Lee wrote in an email. 
She did not respond to a follow up question asking how this lawsuit was the first of its kind. California filed one against nine opioid manufacturers for their roles in the overdose crisis a year earlier than Mississippi’s lawsuit.
Tasker said she was not aware of the 2015 Mississippi case. It does not appear in scholarly articles that trace timelines of prescription opioid-related litigation.
John Davidson, a Ridgeland lawyer who worked on the 2015 Mississippi case and has continued to assist Fitch’s office on opioid cases, did not respond to phone and email inquiries about that lawsuit. The website of his law firm, Davidson PLLC, says it filed “the FIRST opioid case in the country on behalf of a state government.”
William Thompson, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, was raised in that state’s southern coalfields — a region of Appalachia that, by many metrics, suffered more harm from the overdose crisis than anywhere in the country. He remembers people he grew up with who had the potential to become doctors, lawyers, engineers or teachers, but were never able to escape addiction.

Thompson said West Virginia’s 2001 lawsuit and a series of cases against opioid distributing companies were filed out of necessity, as the public health crisis was taking over the state. He said some of the settlement dollars from the first case were used to help start a southern West Virginia court that connects people struggling with addiction to treatment, a program he oversaw as a circuit court judge. 
“It’s sad when you see your home community devastated by opioids, and that it has to be the laboratory for some type of solution to the problem,” Thompson said. 
He said he welcomes any elected officials, in Mississippi or elsewhere, using their positions to combat the calamity that has claimed more than a million lives. From new drugs of concern to diminishing federal mental health investments, the crisis is changing in ways that require states to think of innovative solutions. 
“But this has been a problem,” Thompson said. “And this is something that the courts have tried to fix since at least 2001.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31114854/3X0A0139.jpg,,,2025-08-01 06:56:35.348329

Updated
Penny Schwinn, in line to serve as second in command of the U.S. Department of Education, has withdrawn from the nomination, Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced Thursday.
Instead, the former Tennessee education commissioner will take on a different role for the department.
“I am grateful to Dr. Schwinn for her commitment to serving students, families, and educators across the nation,” McMahon said in a statement. “Penny is a brilliant education mind and I look forward to continuing working with her as my chief strategist to make education great again.”
Schwinn, in a statement, said she gave the decision “thoughtful consideration” and said she will  “remain committed to protecting kids, raising achievement and expanding opportunity  —  my lifelong mission and north star.”
Considered a champion for improving reading outcomes and high-dosage tutoring, Schwinn was among President Donald Trump’s early picks for department posts. Many perceived her as a more bipartisan choice than others joining the administration, but among Tennessee conservatives, many who felt she was too liberal, opposition to her nomination was strong.
The timing of Schwinn’s withdrawal couldn’t be worse, according to some conservatives.
“Her decision to remove herself from consideration to become deputy secretary hurts students, educators, and the Trump administration,” said Jim Blew, co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute, a think tank. “Secretary McMahon has been charged by Congress and the president with huge tasks under the One Big Beautiful Bill and several urgent executive orders.”
As head of the Education Department, McMahon is striving to turn more authority over education to the states. It’s now unclear who will step into the deputy position and take the lead on the state’s requests for more flexibility over education funding. At least two states, Iowa and Oklahoma, have already submitted requests for block grants, and Indiana is currently gathering comments from the public in preparation for a similar proposal. Kirsten Baesler, North Dakota’s long-time education chief, is currently awaiting confirmation to be assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the department. In February, she joined 11 other GOP chiefs in asking McMahon for greater freedom to direct education funds toward state-level needs.
Controversies and questions over Schwinn’s conservative qualifications have followed her for years. Far-right groups, including Moms for Liberty, said her past support for equity initiatives, like hiring more teachers of color, was evidence that she was not a good fit for an administration determined to eliminate such programs. Others remained angry over Schwinn’s pandemic-era plan to conduct “well-being” home visits. Even though she scrapped the plan, parents and members of the legislature considered it an example of government overreach.
More recently, Steve Gill, a conservative commentator in Tennessee, reported that while she was deputy superintendent of the Texas Education Agency, Schwinn recommended individuals who advocate for comprehensive sex education, including abortion rights, to advise the state on health curriculum.
Gill told The 74 he shared his TriStar Daily article about her stance on these issues with Tennessee Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, as well as the state’s congressional delegation. Blackburn, who is expected to run for governor next year, was considered a possible no vote for Schwinn.
According to Gill, Blackburn’s office “has been working tirelessly behind the scenes with the White House, Secretary Linda McMahon and Majority Leader [John] Thune to block the confirmation.”
But Madi Biedermann, spokeswoman for the department, said the agency “strongly disagrees with that characterization.”

Blew said it’s unfortunate that politics got in the way, noting that Schwinn’s experience in both blue and red states would have brought valuable expertise to the Ed Department role. In addition to her jobs in Tennessee and Texas, Schwinn founded a charter school in Sacramento and also served in the Delaware Department of Education.
“It’s sad that a handful of demagogues are standing in the way of giving Secretary McMahon the team she needs to succeed,” he said.
Others praised Schwinn’s record of prioritizing the science of reading in Tennessee schools and directing COVID relief funds toward tutoring.
“This is a setback for all who want to see Washington slashing red tape, advancing literacy and fighting for common sense values,” said Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
For some critics, Schwinn’s business ventures since leaving the top spot in Tennessee two years ago raised questions as she waited to appear before the Senate education committee.
In June, a day ahead of her joint hearing with three other nominees, The 74 reported that shortly after Trump tapped her for the job, she registered a new education consulting business in Florida, New Horizon BluePrint Group, with a longtime colleague. Before Schwinn filed ethics paperwork with the federal government, her sister replaced her as a manager on the business.
When a reporter from The 74 asked questions about the new project, Donald Fennoy, her colleague and a former superintendent of the Palm Beach County School District, dissolved the business.
Ethics experts say candidates for an administration post often distance themselves from new business entanglements to avoid any appearance of a conflict, but Schwinn has faced accusations of poor judgment before.
While she was in Texas, the state agency signed a $4.4 million no-bid contract in 2017 with a software company where she had a “professional relationship” with a subcontractor, according to a state audit. And in Tennessee, the education agency made an $8 million deal in 2021 with TNTP, a teacher training organization where her husband Paul Schwinn was employed at the time. Lawmakers considered the deal a “huge conflict.”
“Ethics was a crucial concern,” said J.C. Bowman, executive director and CEO of Professional Educators of Tennessee, a non-union organization. He was among those who sent letters to the Senate, asking them to remove her from consideration. “Her personal business interests and possible conflicts could potentially influence educational decisions in ways that many found difficult to overlook.”
Clarification: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the role Penny Schwinn will take on in lieu of serving as the deputy education secretary. Schwinn will be taking on an advisory role at the Education Department.

A federal appeals panel in Boston posed this very question to the Rhode Island Supreme Court in February 2024 while considering the constitutionality of a law halting competing truck dealerships from operating within 20 miles without giving notice to the state.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals finally heard back with an answer Tuesday: Yes, Rhode Island’s law does reach across the state line.
“We take judicial notice of the fact that the state of Rhode Island is only 37 miles wide,” Rhode Island State Supreme Court Associate Justice Melissa A. Long wrote in the court’s July 29 opinion. “Given the state’s size, a circle with a radius of 20 miles will always encompass an area outside the state.”
The question over the reach of Rhode Island’s dealer law is at the center of a legal dispute that began in 2019 after Daimler Trucks North America authorized Advantage Truck Group to sell Freightliner-brand trucks at its dealership on Route 44 in Raynham, Massachusetts. 
Advantage Truck is 18 miles from Rhode Island Truck Center in East Providence, which was authorized by Daimler to sell the same brand in 2016.
In 2022, Rhode Island Truck Center filed a protest petition against Daimler before the Rhode Island Motor Vehicle Dealers License and Hearing Board, a board created under the state’s dealer law to hear disputes between manufacturers and dealers. The five-member panel ultimately dismissed the case during the meeting held June 1, 2022, “due to a lack of jurisdiction.”
“This board lacks the authority to apply the provisions of the Rhode Island dealer law in an extraterritorial manner and therefore cannot prohibit respondent from establishing or moving a dealership outside the boundaries of this state,” wrote then-Chairman James Botvin.
The board had cited a 1994 case in which a Massachusetts-based Nissan dealership protested the establishment of a competitor in Rhode Island, only for the petition to be dropped on the grounds that out-of-state dealers lacked standing to protest under its dealer law.
Rhode Island Truck Center appealed the board’s dismissal in Providence County Superior Court, which Daimler then had moved to the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island where Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in favor of Daimler on Oct. 24, 2022.
McConnell ruled that Rhode Island’s law violated the U.S. Constitution’s Dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from engaging in protectionist practices against other states.










We take judicial notice of the fact that the state of Rhode Island is only 37 miles wide. Given the state’s size, a circle with a radius of 20 miles will always encompass an area outside the state. 


– Rhode Island State Supreme Court Associate Justice Melissa A. Long


Rhode Island Truck Center appealed to the 1st Circuit Court in Boston, which submitted a “certified question” to the Rhode Island Supreme Court to define the state’s dealer law. It’s a process that doesn’t get used too often, Roger Williams University School of Law professor Michael Yelnosky said in an interview. 
The last time the Rhode Island Supreme Court answered a certified question was in 2021 over the definition of “civil action” under the state’s insurance law.
For a federal court to certify a question, Yelnosky said two things are required: First, the case must hinge on an essential question of state law. Second, the state courts should not yet have answered that question in any prior cases.
When a question is certified, Yelnosky said, it’s done under the legal doctrine of “constitutional avoidance” — a way for the federal court to resolve a case without relying on constitutional grounds.
“A constitutional question does go away if the court had said it only applies in Rhode Island,” he said. 
But Long’s answer now means the federal appeals court must decide on the constitutionality of Rhode Island’s dealer law. 
“As a general matter, state A can’t control the matters of state B,” Yelnosky said. “That’s a violation of state B’s sovereignty.”
Andrew Johnson, head of communications for Daimler North America, based in Portland, Oregon, declined to comment on the case.
“We don’t comment on pending litigation,” he said.
Joe Travers, Rhode Island Truck Center’s director of operations, called the state Supreme Court’s answer to the certified question “a big win” for the company, which employs 50 people. 
“It’s definitely been an impact on business,” he said of having a competitor so close to the truck center. “I’m not sure how equitable it is for us. When you look at all the things impacting economic conditions right now, does that justify having that kind of saturation?
But Travers said the dealership has managed to maintain its regular customers including the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, along with municipalities like Pawtucket, Warwick, and Warren. Rhode Island Truck Center also holds accounts for numerous oil companies in the area, Gold Medal Bakery in Fall River, Massachusetts, and the National Lumber Company in Mansfield, Massachusetts.
“We have a pretty diverse customer base,” he said.
Not mentioned in any of the legal filings is how Massachusetts’ own dealer law defines “relevant market area” — which is set at an 8-mile radius between competing franchises within Bristol County.
But Yelnosky said the Massachusetts limit is irrelevant to the federal appeals court’s proceedings since its focus is squarely on Rhode Island’s law.
Still, he said he found it “cute” to see Rhode Island’s small size noted in the state Supreme Court’s opinion.
“We don’t think about state lines here as much as people do in other parts of the country,” Yelnosky said. “You can drive in and out of two or three states in the matter of a couple hours here.”

On Monday, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals handed another loss to voting rights advocates in Arkansas and the other states in the 8th Circuit by continuing to erode the power of the Voting Rights Act, or VRA, a 60-year-old cornerstone of federal civil rights law.
The U.S. Supreme Court is now considering whether to take up a different VRA case from North Dakota, also part of the conservative 8th Circuit. If it does, the stakes will be high.
There’s some reason to think a majority of the justices might disagree with the 8th Circuit’s restrictive, precedent-defying interpretation of the VRA — which was outlined in 2022 with a different case out of Arkansas — thus restoring Arkansas voting advocates’ ability to challenge allegedly racially discriminatory practices under the civil rights law. But if the Supreme Court sides with the 8th Circuit, such VRA lawsuits could become non-starters everywhere in the country.




The Monday ruling from the 8th Circuit was about an Arkansas law that dates back to 2009, under Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe. The law places limits on how many voters a particular individual can assist at the polls in the name of fraud prevention; it makes it illegal for a single person to help more than six voters cast a ballot. That’s been a problem for the immigrant advocacy group Arkansas United, which says the restriction makes it unnecessarily hard for translators to assist voters who aren’t fluent in English.




Arkansas United sued under the Voting Rights Act in 2020, and in 2022 a federal judge in Fayetteville sided with the group. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks issued an order blocking the state law, though the 8th Circuit stayed Brooks’ injunction while it heard the state’s appeal of his ruling.
On Monday, the 8th Circuit reversed Brooks’ order, but not on the merits of the case. Instead, a three-judge panel of the appellate court said Arkansas United had no standing to sue under the VRA. The law only gives the U.S. attorney general the power to bring a lawsuit, the 8th Circuit panel said.
That’s more or less the same conclusion another 8th Circuit panel reached in 2023 in a different Arkansas VRA case, that one about gerrymandering. In that case, the Arkansas NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel — represented by the ACLU of Arkansas — contended that the state’s redrawing of state legislative district lines in 2021 diluted the power of minority voters.
The federal judge in Little Rock who originally heard the NAACP case, U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky, conceded there might be some evidence of discrimination in how Arkansas Republicans drew legislative maps after the 2020 census. But, Rudofsky said, whether or not the new lines might be discriminatory was immaterial because the plaintiffs couldn’t sue in the first place. The suit was brought under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and the judge said that section doesn’t allow for a private right of action, meaning private citizens or entities do not have standing to sue. That’s despite the fact that individuals and voting-rights groups have long sued to enforce the federal law under Section 2.
The decision was a radical departure from how courts have handled VRA cases over the decades, but it went down well with the conservative 8th Circuit. The appeals court embraced the new theory put forth by Rudofsky — a Trump appointee who previously worked for the Arkansas attorney general’s office — and has applied it more broadly. The case brought by Arkansas United included a claim under a different section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 208, which protects the right of disabled voters or those with language barriers to receive assistance. The 8th Circuit’s ruling on Monday said there’s no private right of action under that section, either.



That brings us to the Voting Rights Act case out of North Dakota, memorably shorthanded as the “Turtle Mountain” case. It was brought by two Native American tribes —  the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe — along with three individual voters, all of whom say that state’s legislative map was redrawn in a racially discriminatory way. The plaintiffs sued, a federal judge sided with the tribes, and North Dakota appealed to the 8th Circuit.



In May, a split three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit reversed the lower court, saying again that the Voting Rights Act doesn’t allow for private plaintiffs to sue — only the federal government.
The plaintiffs went to the Supreme Court and asked it to intervene. On July 15, the high court granted their request for a temporary stay, blocking the 8th Circuit’s ruling from going into effect for the time being while the justices consider the request.
The three Supreme Court justices generally considered most right-wing, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, said they disagreed with the decision to grant the temporary stay. That means the Turtle Mountain plaintiffs — and voting rights advocates more generally — still have a chance, despite the court’s conservative slant. The temporary stay suggests that Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts are at least somewhat skeptical of the 8th Circuit’s recent rulings and the “no private right of action” interpretation of the Voting Rights Act explicated by Rudofsky.
It’s still unclear whether the court will take up the full Turtle Mountain case or not. Even if does, a decision won’t come until next year at the earliest. But there’s a bit of hope there for voting rights protections, even if it’s not much.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Supreme-Court-Guardian-of-Law.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

The state has had at least 51 flash flood warnings so far this year, its most since 2020","Gov. Wes Moore (D) inspects damage at a library in Westernport on May 15, 2025, in the wake of flooding in Western Maryland in the previous week. (Photo by Patrick Siebert/Governor's office)Severe thunderstorms across Maryland on Thursday brought torrential rainfall reaching up to 6 inches in some areas, causing thousands to lose power and requiring several water rescues in Harford County after multiple cars were trapped by rising water.
Earlier this month, dozens of others had to be rescued from trapped cars in Montgomery and Fairfax counties after torrential rainfall in the Washington, D.C., area on July 19.
And in mid-May, flooding caused by days of heavy rain led to millions of dollars in damage and emergency response costs to several Western Maryland communities.
As the heat and humidity have increased in Maryland, so too has the number of flash floods. The state has had at least 51 flash flood warnings so far this year, its most since 2020, according to the National Weather Service. Maryland had 45 warnings throughout all of 2024.
Chris Strong, the warning coordination meteorologist for the NWS Baltimore-Washington office, attributed the increase to the abnormally hot and humid conditions, especially over the past six weeks. Flash floods typically occur in the early summer months from about June to August, he said.
“We haven’t had a lot of extreme heat days where it’s been over 100 degrees, but we’ve had a lot of very warm days, and, more importantly for the flash flooding, a lot of very humid days,” Strong said.
James Hyde, manager of the Maryland Mesonet, a growing network of weather-monitoring stations across the state run through the University of Maryland, College Park, said there is a higher amount of precipitable water in the atmosphere, which he described as “if you took all the water in the air above your head” and squished it down into a cup and then measured the amount.
Normally, Hyde said, precipitable water ranges from about 1.3 to 1.4 inches during this time of year. But during the thunderstorms this summer, the amount has ranged from 1.8 to 2.3 inches, which is up to a 75% increase.










Water is one of the most powerful forces there is. In terms of direct fatalities, nothing’s a bigger weather killer than flooding is. So anytime there’s flash flood warnings in particular for your area, people’s awareness should be heightened as to what the water is doing around them.


– Chris Strong, warning coordination meteorologist, National Weather Service


The combination of high humidity and temperatures in the lower atmosphere and weak wind flow in the upper atmosphere has led to slow-moving thunderstorms producing heavy rainfall — the perfect recipe for flash flooding, Hyde said.
“They tend to sit and dump rain,” he said. “That’s when you start to get the flash flooding scenarios. The soils quickly become saturated, it goes into surface runoff, etc.”
First came drought
The increase in flooding this summer comes after a roughly two-year long period of drought in Maryland, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s restoration specialist Rob Schnabel.
A year ago, about two-thirds of the state was classified as abnormally dry, while almost a quarter was in severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. On Thursday, only 3% of the state’s land was classified as abnormally dry.
Schnabel said that as the climate changes, the state is seeing these periods of drought followed by large, sudden rainfalls.
“Once the soil is really dried out, and kind of baked somewhat with the heat temperatures, it actually has less ability for water to infiltrate into the ground,” he said. “Healthy soil is 25% air, 25% water and then the rest is solid material. But once you bake the ground and lose that water vapor in the ground, you lose that sponge effect.”
When there are these kinds of heavy rainfalls after two years of drought, he said, some of the soil “might as well be pavement.”
Another key issue, Schnabel added, is Maryland’s lack of stormwater management as continued urban development leads to more impervious surfaces, like parking lots or roadways, which can’t soak up water and instead create more runoff.
To combat the issue, communities can utilize multiple strategies such as planting more trees, which can absorb up to 13,000 gallons of water a year each, or creating rain gardens in natural drainage areas in parking lots, he said.
“We really need to focus more on water volume,” he said. “What happens on the land is going to determine the whole success of the Chesapeake Bay cleanup. So we need to do a better job of addressing water up on the land prior to it coming into our stream systems and into the bay.”
More floods, more collaboration
The increased flooding has caused damage to several communities across the state so far this year, including many in Western Maryland.
From May 12 to 14, “extreme rainfall” triggered significant flooding which inundated several communities in Garrett and Allegany counties. According to official estimates, the floods caused $15.8 million in emergency response costs and damage to local infrastructure — including 200 homes.
Last month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied the state’s request for emergency assistance funds.  Speaking to reporters in Westernport on Sunday, Gov. Wes Moore (D) called the denial a “political decision” by President Donald Trump (R), and criticized it as petty, partisan and punishing.
But as the state faces more and more floods, Hyde said he has “never seen more collaboration” among weather analysts, state emergency management officials and those who run the warning systems.
“People behind the scenes are watching this and paying attention,” he said. “The Mesonet takes observations every three seconds, and we’re transmitting that data every minute.”
One strategy counties are employing to combat the danger of flash flooding, Strong said, is to purchase properties that are at particular risk for flash floods so there’s less exposure to the public when one occurs.
And as the state’s weather monitoring systems improve, Strong said the goal is to increase the time between when a warning is issued and when actual flooding occurs. Currently, he said the average is about an hour before a flood occurs that a warning is sent out.
He emphasized the danger that flash floods pose, particularly for low-lying areas where water drains to.
“Water is one of the most powerful forces there is,” he said. “In terms of direct fatalities, nothing’s a bigger weather killer than flooding is. So anytime there’s flash flood warnings in particular for your area, people’s awareness should be heightened as to what the water is doing around them.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PS3_3926-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

Duke Energy can now backslide on its legally mandated carbon emissions reductions, offload a greater share of fuel costs to residential customers and charge ratepayers for financing costs of planned new power plants even if they’re never built.
On Tuesday the North Carolina House and Senate overrode Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of Senate Bill 266, “The Power Bill Reduction Act.”
Stein vetoed the measure July 2. “This summer’s record heat and soaring utility bills have shown that we need to focus on lowering electricity costs for working families—not raising them. … Additionally, this bill walks back our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions,” Stein wrote in his veto message.
The bill allows Duke Energy to amp up its use of natural gas while cancelling its interim carbon reduction goal of 70 percent by 2030. That benchmark, a crucial and highly lauded provision, was part of a climate law enacted by the legislature just four years ago.
The utility would still be required to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists reported in 2022 that “without dramatic action in the next couple of decades, we are unlikely to keep global warming in this century below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit compared to pre-industrial temperatures”—the threshold at which the most serious climate impacts can be mitigated.
“But the more we overshoot that threshold, the more serious and widespread the negative impacts will be,” the NOAA scientists wrote.


  Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Our planet is on fire,” said state Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Guilford County Democrat, on the House floor Tuesday, as she pleaded with her colleagues to sustain the governor’s veto. “We have got to reduce our carbon emissions.”
The new law was introduced in March as Senate Bill 261, sponsored by Republican Sen. Paul Newton, a former Duke Energy executive. (Newton resigned shortly after introducing the bill to accept a job as vice chancellor and general counsel for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.)
At the time, Duke Energy spokesman Garrett Poorman told Inside Climate News that as North Carolina continues to experience unprecedented growth, “we’re focused on making substantial investments in our critical infrastructure to ensure reliability and keep costs as low and predictable as possible for our customers. We are supportive of policies that enable us to meet the state’s growing energy needs, including those that advance efficient and always-on baseload generation resources.”


The bill idled until early June, when its contents were cut and pasted into SB 266, which originally exempted buildings reconstructed after historic floods from floodplain requirements. Bill sponsors then rushed the measure through. Some members of the House Rules Committee had only 12 hours to review the measure before voting on it, Harrison said at the time, adding it became publicly available just 10 minutes before the committee hearing.
Bill sponsors and proponents, including Duke Energy, the N.C. Chamber, the American Petroleum Institute and the N.C. Manufacturers Alliance, have relied on an analysis by the Public Staff of the N.C. Utilities Commission to justify their claims that the measure will lower energy costs.


  Rep. Dean Arp (R-Union) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“This bill is about one thing: saving all consumers money on electric bills,” said Rep. Dean Arp, a Republican from Union County who co-sponsored the measure.
The Public Staff estimated that by eliminating Duke’s interim carbon reductions goal, ratepayers could save $13 billion in energy costs by 2050. However, that modeling did not account for the volatility in natural gas prices, nor the escalating costs of turbines required to build the new plants.
An analysis written by three N.C. State University environmental engineering professors accounted for those increases. They estimated that removing the interim target could cost ratepayers up to $23 billion in added fuel expenses over the same time. Even moderate increases in natural gas prices would hike fuel costs to $13.7 billion if the interim target is dropped, they found.


Earlier this week, two economists from Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability reviewed that analysis and agreed with its overall findings. They additionally factored in the Trump administration’s rollbacks of incentives for renewable energy, which “are also likely to result in a grid that is more reliant on natural gas generation.”
A repeal or revision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Final Greenhouse Gas Rule and its provisions for either carbon capture or limits on new gas units could also lead to additional demand for natural gas by utilities, according to the Duke University economists.
“This additional gas demand … may lead to higher natural gas prices in North Carolina and potentially increase volatility in gas markets,” they wrote.
Higher fuel costs won’t be apportioned equally among Duke Energy’s North Carolina customers. The new law now shifts 55 percent of fuel costs to residential customers, with 45 percent to commercial and industrial sectors. Previously, those costs were split 50-50.
The measure will also let Duke Energy charge financing costs of power plants to ratepayers before those facilities are built. Bill opponents are concerned that could saddle North Carolinians with higher electric bills if those projects are never finished.
This scenario played out in South Carolina, where ratepayers had to cover $9 billion in costs for the Summer nuclear plant, which was canceled because of higher-than-predicted costs.
After the override vote, Dan Crawford, the N.C. League of Conservation Voters’ director of governmental relations, released a statement: “Today, lawmakers chose to reward corporate greed over the people they were elected to serve. By overriding the governor’s veto, they handed Duke Energy a blank check—one that North Carolinians will be forced to pay.”
Drew Ball, Southeast campaigns director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the bill “a handout to Duke Energy that shifts billions in cost and significant risks squarely onto North Carolina families. … It pushes outdated, costly gas plants that deepen our dependence on a fragile fuel supply.”
Ball is also a commissioner for Buncombe County, an area that includes Asheville, one of the hardest-hit by Hurricane Helene. More than 40 people there died because of the storm, which a climate attribution study last year showed had more punishing rains as a result of global warming.
Opponents of SB 266 had scheduled a rally outside the legislature for late Monday afternoon. They canceled the event because the heat index was forecast to reach 115 degrees, an irony not lost on organizers.
As the House was holding its override vote mid-morning Tuesday, the heat index in Raleigh was already approaching 100—the 18th day this summer to hit this mark, according to WRAL meteorologists. Historical weather data shows that 2025 is on track to be the warmest on record in central North Carolina.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Asheville-power-plant-Duke-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

Censored, too, was a book entitled “Sexual health information for teens: health tips about sexual development,” described by its publisher as “basic consumer health information for teens about puberty, sexuality, reproductive health, contraception, and disease prevention.””
Likewise jettisoned were copies of “Encyclopedia of the Human Body,” “The Way We Work: Getting to Know the Amazing Human Body,” and “The Medical Advisor: The Complete Guide to Alternative and Conventional Treatments.”  
The conservative library review movement in Virginia’s public schools, which has galvanized during the tenure of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, purports to be about protecting parents’ rights to know what their children read. The July report by Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) put the lie to that claim. 
Book banners in schools want to dictate what students can learn in their classrooms and from their libraries, regardless of what individual parents and guardians believe. No greater violation of adults’ child-rearing choices exists than the moral arbitration right-wing extremists hope heap on them.
JLARC found that 63% of Virginia public schools removed no books from their libraries. That good news was tempered by the fact that one in three had removed at least one book. But the real bad news is that the public-school book ban movement is just getting up to speed, as holier-than-you evangelical Christians try to take over school boards across the country. We’ve seen it in Pennsylvania, Florida, and other states. As many of those types of people gain positions of power in the administration of President Donald Trump, violations of parents’ First Amendment rights by radical theocrats seem likely to accelerate.
Hanover County, which lies about 30 miles north of Richmond, serves as a cautionary tale. Hanover schools are governed by a conservative majority and the school board is appointed, not elected like most school districts in the state. The JLARC report revealed that Hanover accounted for 36% of all “book removal actions” in the state. Hanover removed 125 titles from its schools from July 2020 until March 2025, the report found.
Hanover school board referendum is an opportunity to see democracy in action

This is the last step in a progression that begins with challenging content in library books, then pulling them from shelves and requiring guardian consent to check them out, and finally, removing them from libraries entirely. 
Letting political and religious ideologues control children’s reading choices leads to censoring their exposure to prize-winning literature  and reflects obvious prejudices against books about racism and LGBTQ+ issues. It sacrifices scientific knowledge to faith and, in some cases, ignorance. Hanover proves that.  
The conservative attack on diversity, equity and inclusion – all fundamental American values – will lead to a literal whitewash of U.S. history and doesn’t serve anyone who believes that those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 
Censorship to shape politics and culture like what is happening in Hanover often finds its natural conclusion in symbolic or actual book burnings, like those that famously fired up Hitler’s power in Germany.
Banned books in Hanover don’t just include books about gender or sexual identity. The list also includes literary classics by Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, Booker Prize winner Maragaret Atwood, and National Book Award winner Kurt Vonnegut.
For would-be book banners, a single sex scene in hundreds of pages or a suggestion of white racism now serves as justification for exclusion from a school library. 
As that continues, taboos grow. Hanover County dumped “The Freedom Writers Diary.” The book tells the story of a California teacher who taught students about the Holocaust by making them read and write about “The Diary of Anne Frank.”
School districts struggle to implement new laws on sexually explicit books

To get an idea of how far-gone Hanover is, the county Board of Supervisors removed references to school library censorship from a certificate it gave a Hanover student who won a national Girl Scout award.  Kate Lindley received a “Freedom to Read” award from the Girl Scouts for establishing a website and a series of “Banned Book Nooks” in the county where students could read books the school board had removed from libraries.
As she accepted her certificate from the Board of Supervisors, Lindley showed  more class than the governing body.
“You have shown the world that you are afraid to call something what it is, be that a banned book or a deselected one,” she told the board’s conservative majority. “Thank you for this recognition.”
What the rest of us must recognize and resist is the assault on our rights by people who, without our consent, would deprive Virginia kids of access to books like “Jesus Land: A Memoir.” A New York Times bestseller, it tells the true story of a 16-year-old white girl and her Black adopted brother trying to survive a brutal, violent fundamentalist upbringing. It could be that Hanover County banned the book because it does not cast Christian fundamentalism in the light that evangelicals want it seen.
That is the polar opposite of parents’ rights.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).High temperatures this summer have resulted in the deaths of 19 individuals and more than 1,200 Marylanders landing in the emergency room with heat-related illnesses.
That’s a five-year high in hospitalizations related to heat stress, according to updated Department of Health data published this week. It’s also the second highest number of heat-related deaths since 2021, with still 11 weeks in the annual “heat season” left to go.


Cooling centers
For information on cooling centers in all 23 Maryland counties and Baltimore City, go here.


State officials continue to urge Marylanders to keep up with heat safety measures during the remainder of the summer.
“Check in on elderly and those living alone,” was one recent social media post from the Maryland Department of Health. “Drink water and avoid caffeine, alcohol and sugary drinks. Limit time outside and stay in air-conditioned spaces.”
The data is part of weekly reporting on heat-related illnesses during the annual heat season, which runs roughly from the end of April through September.
The elderly population in the state is one of the most vulnerable groups affected by heat illness, according to state health officials, and of the 19 people who have died so far this summer, 16 were over the age of 65. They also were primarily men. Only three women have died from heat-related causes since the start of heat season.


Over the course of July, through July 26, more than 500 people had to go to the emergency room or urgent care and eight people died because of heat illnesses.
Last summer also proved to be extremely dangerous, as a total of 27 people died from heat-related illness, the highest since 2018. If trends continue, the 2025 heat season could be just as deadly.
With many high schools and colleges starting their fall semesters in August, members of the Maryland congressional delegation are trying to make sure that student athletes across the nation are protected from heat illness.
Last week, U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) reintroduced the Jordan McNair Student Athlete Heat Fatality Prevention Act to mandate that schools and colleges create emergency action plans for athletes experiencing heat illness.
The legislation is named after a freshman football player with the University of Maryland who in 2018 collapsed during practice and died from heat stroke symptoms days later.
U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) has filed similar legislation in the House of Representatives, with U.S. Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) and U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-2nd) as co-sponsors, among others.
Mfume and Van Hollen have led previous efforts to pass the Jordan McNair act.
“It is long past time that we pass the  Jordan McNair Student Athlete Heat Fatality Prevention Act and finally ensure student athletes are protected, and college athletic programs implement heat illness emergency action plans and coordinate with local emergency responders,” Alsobrooks said in a written statement last week. “Jordan McNair would be 26 today. We must honor his memory by getting this legislation passed.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2024_march28_baltimore-newsletter-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

(Photo courtesy WVMR)A radio cooperative serving Pocahontas County in West Virginia and two neighboring Virginia communities expects to lose more than half its annual budget after Congress passed a bill rescinding $1.1 billion previously approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Allegheny Mountain Radio comprises WVMR in Dunmore, West Virginia, WVLS in Monterey, Virginia, and WCHG in Hot Springs, Virginia. The stations feature hyperlocal programming including news and entertainment, funeral and lost pets notices, weather, school closings and emergency alerts, station manager Scott Smith said.
The cooperative typically relied on federal funding for 60 to 65% of its annual budget, Smith said. They employ six full time and five part-time workers. Smith said the cooperative won’t make drastic cuts like layoffs or closing stations immediately. They’ll rely on reserve funds for now and look for ways to cut costs. They’ll also try to beef up support from underwriting, private donations and other funding opportunities, he said.

“This will be kind of a transition year, if you will, to where we see how things work without our federal money,” Smith said. “We’ll try to find other sources of income, and we’ll try to find sources we can save money at. But that’s also in the context of continuing on the way we are and what we do.”
While the Corporation for Public Broadcasting funded about 1% of NPR’s budget and 16% of PBS’s budget, Allegheny Mountain Radio is one of hundreds of small stations around the country who relied more heavily on the federal funding. CPB funding made up 19% of West Virginia Public Broadcasting’s budget. Executive director Eddie Isom told West Virginia MetroNews earlier this month it was too soon to say what the funding cut would mean for West Virginia Public Broadcasting.
Trump and other Republicans have criticized NPR and PBS broadcasts for being politically biased and called them a “waste of money.”
West Virginia’s entire congressional delegation, all Republicans, voted in support of rescinding the money. In separate statements after voting, Sen. Jim Justice called the legislation commonsense and said “the days of wasting money with zero regard for the taxpayer are over.” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the bill “eliminates wasteful spending.” Virginia Democrats voted against rescinding the money, while Republicans there voted in support of the bill.
Smith said he had several conversations with congressional leaders representing both Virginia and West Virginia explaining the importance of the station to its communities and the need for the federal funding.
“It didn’t really seem to move the needle, if you will, for the Republican side of the representatives I talked to,” he said.
When the legislation came on to Smith’s radar, he started trying to raise awareness, he said. Since the bill passed, he’s done interviews with national media outlets ranging from Politico to NBC’s Meet the Press and NPR. 
“When the Senate passed this, on that Thursday, then the handwriting was on the wall,” Smith said. “And we quickly became the poster child for the collateral damage of this thing. And multiple people reached out.”
 Volunteer Sam Botkin broadcasts from the WVLS studio in Monteray, Va. (Photo courtesy WVLS)
The media attention garnered the station more than 120 private donations from across the country as of Tuesday morning, he said. The majority of donors had never heard of the station before two weeks ago.
“Yet they heard our story, they looked into us, they said, ‘absolutely, you all should continue to exist. You all are important. And here’s some of our own hard earned money to make that continue to happen.’ That’s moving and validating in a way that you can’t really put into words.”
Several media outlets have asked Smith to explain the value of a small radio station in 2025, when many people get their news and entertainment from other sources. The stations are high in the Appalachian Mountains, he said, where cell service is spotty to nonexistent, he said. The people they serve are older.
“We are still out here providing all the things that I told you for people that may not necessarily turn to their smartphones for their morning news or their music or whatever it is that they’re looking for. They still prefer and use traditional forms of media like us.”
The radio stations are especially important after severe weather events like in 2012, when a derecho knocked out power, phone lines and other infrastructure to much of the state for days. The radio station was still broadcasting to anyone with a car or battery-powered radio, he said.
“We were still on the air broadcasting to anyone that could hear us about where cooling stations, where you could get water, where you could get supplies, when your utilities might come back — just the whole situation,” he said. “So there’s definitely a place for radio in today’s world.”

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
How many people detained by ICE at the Chesterfield Courthouse were there for traffic-related violations?
As the federal government continues an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration nationwide, ICE agents’ detainment of undocumented immigrants at the Chesterfield Courthouse have dominated headlines across the state this summer and prompted pushback from advocates and legislative leaders who say the practice isn’t transparent, fuels fear in Latino communities and hinders due process.
A report from WTVR showed during a four-day period in June, ICE detained 15 people. A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that five of those 15 had non-traffic related violations, with the most serious offense being assault on law enforcement.
The other ten were in court for traffic citations such as improper vehicle registration, or driving while suspended or without a drivers license.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares  supported  the ICE detentions at the courthouse, with the governor saying the majority of undocumented immigrants detained were violent criminals who “should be arrested.”.”
But the television station’s review of those 15 people’s criminal records in the state found only two had faced previous charges for violent offenses.
Over 2,500 people have been detained by ICE in Virginia since March. Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan pushed back against the Youngkin administration’s claim that most of them were violent criminals, stating she does not believe all 2,500 people have violent offenses because of the lack of evidence to support that claim.
McClellan recently introduced legislation into Congress that requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to track and publicly report when U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are detained or deported for immigration purposes. This is in an effort to create transparency and bring to light potential wrongful removals.



The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.



 Loudoun County School Board looks to limit public comments
Twice a month, the Loudoun County School Board has two public comment nights. But one member of the board wants to limit the invitation to the public to speak their minds to  once a month.
WJLA reported that board member Anne Donohue said it has been a challenge to balance receiving public opinions and maintaining time to conduct board business. The topic will be debated at a meeting next month. There could be further limitations after recent meetings have dragged on late into the night.
Hot button topics, such as the debate over if students should be allowed to use the locker room or bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, have drawn large crowds of people eager to share their thoughts.
The report stated that Prince William, Arlington, and Alexandria school boards limit public comment to one hour per meeting. Prince William County can extend that time if there are a lot of speakers. Fairfax County School Board limits the number of people who can speak at each meeting and people are selected through a lottery.
Former Richmond City Council candidate in hot water over campaign finance filings
The Virginia State Police are investigating Tavares Floyd after campaign finance filings for his failed run for the 6th District City Council seat raised questions. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that multiple supposed donors said they never contributed to the campaign.
The paper submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to see the interview notes related to the state police investigation. A FOIA officer rejected the request, stating the files are exempt from production due to being part of an active criminal investigation.
Floyd, who was running against the incumbent Councilwomen Ellen Robertson and another candidate, Willie Hilliard, reported $150,000 in campaign donations from people around the country.
Five donors said they never made donations to Floyd’s campaign, with some stating they had never heard of him. A sixth person listed as a donor had been dead for 30 years.
Floyd reportedly refused to answer the Times-Dispatch’s questions and sent the newspaper a cease and desist letter.
Norfolk Superintendent faced more than one attempt to fire her
Records obtained by journalist Jim Morrison revealed that when Norfolk School Board fired Superintendent Sharon Byrdsong, there had been efforts in the works for years to oust her.
The report published by WHRO explains through emails and phone calls between other board members obtained via Morrison’s FOIA request, Byrdsong had been serving as interim superintendent when she was hired in 2020 and she had not applied for the position. 
The former school board chair had written in a Feb. 19, 2020 email that a phone call from former school board member Rodney Jordan seemed threatening because he pressured Byrdsong not to apply for the job, saying it would “ruin her career”.
The board ultimately approved a contract for Byrdsong but there were divisions between the board members on if they approved of having her in the position.
The 4-3 vote that ended Byrdsong’s tenure as the superintendent had been added last-minute to the agenda and did not provide cause for her termination. The termination didn’t include a public announcement about her severance package, which is required by Virginia law to be shared.
Emails obtained through public records requests show that there had been negotiations between Byrdsong and her attorney before the vote for her to potentially resign without cause. They also showed there had been attempts in 2024 to oust Byrdsong that had been thwarted by other members of the board.
After she was fired, the Norfolk City Council seemingly hit back at the school board by passing a resolution praising her and spoke about her successes. 
Morrison faced some challenges getting the public records requests in this case and ended up taking Norfolk Public Schools to court to obtain the records. He faced delays, omissions, and what he considered to be excessive fees for the files. After he filed suit, he reported that the school district had been much more responsive to his requests and even waived all fees.

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.











It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, professor of sports marketing at Clemson University



After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
Kansas v. Missouri stadium battle shows how states are reigniting border wars

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

(Photo Credit: Return ‘Em Right)It happens with a tug at first, the smallest indication that a fish has taken interest in the bait on your hook. Then it pulls hard and steady, bending the fishing rod into a steep downward arc toward the water.
The reel digs into the palm of your hand as you work to spool back the line with — hopefully — a prized red snapper on the end. It rushes through the deep blue of the water, from hundreds of feet below up to the surface, the shining red- and white-scaled creature breaking through the waves.
But fish like red snapper face health risks when pulled up to the surface too quickly from such depths. Much like a scuba diver, they can be hurt from the sudden, dramatic change in pressure.
Fishing experts and researchers have explored different ways to address the concern, with federal rules and special tools having been created for use on the water. But convincing anglers to follow and use them is challenging, especially as one key law is set to expire soon.
Barotrauma, an injury sustained by a rapid change in pressure, heavily affects reef fish when they are pulled up from deeper water. Gases in the fish’s body expand as they accelerate toward the surface, where they “blow up like a balloon,” said Nicholas Haddad, communications manager for Return ‘Em Right, a nonprofit partnership program funded with settlement money from the BP-Deepwater Horizon disaster.
Return ‘Em Right uses the funds to send free descending device release gear to the angling community in the Gulf of Mexico and provides education on how to use them.
An avid angler in his own right with a background in fisheries management and biological science, Haddad said the signs of barotrauma, such as bulging eyes and organs protruding from a fish’s body, “can be kind of gruesome looking.”
Barotrauma mainly affects fish species that spend most of their time at the bottom of the water column or on reefs. Some fish are vulnerable to pressure damage at depths as shallow as 30 feet.
“Once you start fishing deeper than that, the signs of barotrauma will continue to get worse,” Haddad said. “So if you’re fishing in 150 feet or deeper, likely every fish you pull up will have barotrauma.”
If a fish is out of season or not within the size range anglers can keep, it has to be put back into the water alive. Barotrauma prevents fish from being able to swim back down to the bottom on their own, making them a floating, vulnerable meal for predators or causing them to succumb to their pressure-related injuries.
“It’s almost like trying to swim down with a life vest,” Haddad said. “You’re buoyant so you can’t get down on your own, so you’ve got to do something to overcome that.”
Haddad said, for many years, few anglers knew there was anything they could do to help fish swim back down to the bottom. But programs and groups such as Return ‘Em Right and Louisiana SeaGrant, part of a network addressing marine issues, are spreading the word about tools that can help fish survive and better recover from barotrauma.
Jeffrey Plumlee, a fisheries scientist with Louisiana SeaGrant and assistant professor at Louisiana State University, recommends using gear that’s designed to alleviate the pressure put on a fish’s body, called venting tools or descending devices. A big push to increase their use has made them popular along the Pacific Coast over the past 20 years, he said.
“You attach them to the lip of the fish … attach it to a spare rod and reel, or you can attach it to a rope and a hand line, and basically lower the fish back down,” he said.
The slow descent allows the fish to release built-up pressure that would otherwise prevent it from swimming to the bottom on its own.
“All those physics, everything is happening in reverse, so all those gasses are recompressing naturally,” Plumlee said.
Fishers can use venting tools, as simple as a hollow needle, to manually release the pressure inside the fish’s swim bladder, the main organ that puffs up with gas as a fish is pulled to the surface. While piercing the swim bladder is better than doing nothing, Plumlee said there is a risk of piercing the wrong organ and harming the fish more.
Both methods require specialized gear and extra time to help get the fish back to depth.
Venting or decompressing fish increases their chances at survival dramatically, said Haddad, citing a wide body of preliminary research into the effectiveness of these tools.
“When you add that up to tens of millions of fish a year, it can really add up in the survival rates,” he said.
But anglers have mixed feelings on whether they believe in using these tools.

The DESCEND Act, a federal law sponsored by then U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, R-Baton Rouge, in 2020, requires fishers in federal waters have either a venting tool or descending device on their vessel and ready to use. But it doesn’t require anglers to actually use the tools.
Enforcement would be nearly impossible, said Emily Muehlstein, spokeswoman for the Gulf Council, one of eight regional fishery management groups Congress has tasked to manage and guide fisheries.
It can be hard to break into the culture, said Myron Fischer, a retired biologist with Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and former charter fishing captain.
His son, Richard Fischer, president of the Louisiana Charter Boat Association, said promoting the use of descending devices throughout his organization and changing the culture is a priority.
“These people charging well over $1,000 to go fish, maybe closer to $2,000, they’re in a rush,” Myron Fischer said. “They want to get that fish off the line and get a customer baited and go back down.”
“I think the need for education is very important and needed,” Richard Fischer said.
“There are some recreational fishermen that don’t take conservation seriously, and [descending devices are] just kind of collecting dust on their boat,” he added. “So if they get stopped by enforcement,  ‘Yeah, here it is. I got it,’ and they never had any intention of using it.”
And the law is about to change; the DESCEND Act, signed into law by President Trump in his first term in office, is set to expire in January.
“I do think that, regardless of whether or not there’s a regulation, a good bit of the fleet is already adopting those behaviors,” Muehlstein said.
“I don’t think a lot of dudes are gonna chuck the gear off their boats just because the DESCEND Act is gone,”she added.
The Gulf Council is interested in placing the DESCEND Act’s standards in its own rules, having previously required fishers in its jurisdiction to have a venting tool on board their vessel.
But it won’t be in place by the time the federal law expires.
“A lot of the requirements of our rulemaking, we have to base our management decisions on the best available scientific information,” Muehlstein said.
The Gulf Council wants to see more population-level research, such as exact mortality rates for different species, how different sexes of fish are affected and data over longer periods of time, before it implements a new rule, she said.
“It’s very much a fledgling field, like we’re kind of newly learning about these tools and how useful they are and how impactful they can be,” Muehlstein said.
Researchers now rely mostly on information reported from anglers, Plumlee said, which can vary in accuracy. Newer methods, such as satellite imaging of popular recreational fishing spots to assess how many boats travel and fish there, can help provide more precise information, he said, but there is still much more to figure out.
“If we can get better data collection – and if we can get better estimates of how many people are using these descender devices that we know are effective – we can reduce the amount of discard mortality that we’re assuming,” Plumlee said.
With more research, these tools could have a large impact on the number of fish in the ecosystem, he said.
“By making sure that they get back down to depth and recover from this injury so that they can live to be caught another day, that’s a really important concept,” Plumlee said.
Muehlstein thinks progress is being made but also said there’s more work to be done with continued education and further research.
“I think that in recent years, people have been slowly adopting and changing to using descending devices,” she said. “But I don’t know that a majority of folks have done that, especially some of those old salted guys that are just going to do it the way they’ve always done it.”

Kelly Ayotte signs Senate Bill 245, which bans surprise billing and standardizes pricing for ambulances in New Hampshire, on a stretcher at a ceremonial bill signing in Nashua Thursday. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed Senate Bill 245 on top of a stretcher Thursday morning.
“I have not signed a bill on a stretcher (before),” she quipped. “This is a good circumstance to do it. I wouldn’t want to do it in others, but if I had to, I would. I want you to know.”
Ayotte was at American Medical Rescue in Nashua, surrounded by ambulances and paramedics, for a ceremonial bill signing. The legislation she signed into law prohibits surprise ambulance billing in New Hampshire and sets the rates at which ambulance providers can legally charge for their services.
“Imagine if you or a loved one needed an ambulance because you were having a health situation that threatened your life,” Ayotte said. “This bill is going to make sure that when you have that ambulance come to your house for your mother or your father or your loved one, that there’s not a surprise bill that comes afterwards, that really makes you feel, ‘Wow. How can I pay for this? How am I going to meet this financial challenge?’ So this is incredibly important, and for our ambulance providers in our cities like Nashua all the way up to our most rural areas, they need to receive fair rates so that they can actually have the resources to get those ambulances to people in their most difficult circumstances.”
Surprise billing, also known as balance billing, occurs when an ambulance costs more than the insurer is willing to pay for it and the patient is billed for the rest of the ambulance ride. SB 245 bans that practice beginning Jan. 1.
The bill also mandates the rate ambulance providers will charge insurers (unless the two parties come to an outside agreement for a different price). This bill sets the rate at 350% of the federal Medicare rate, which varies depending on the location and other factors, for the first two years it is in effect. After those two years are up, the state Insurance Department will set a new, updated rate based on an actuarial study that takes into account inflation and other market factors.
SB 245, which was sponsored by West Lebanon Democratic Sen. Sue Prentiss, beat out several competing bills meant to address this issue. That includes House Bill 316, sponsored by Rindge Republican Rep. John Hunt, which also banned surprise billing but used an actuarial study previously commissioned by the Insurance Department to set the initial rate at 202%. (The study came after the Legislature passed a bill in June 2024 requesting it, and the final report was released in January.) That bill was lambasted by ambulance providers, who thought the rate was too low.
Hunt, who was not at Thursday’s bill signing, previously said he believes SB 245’s rate of 325% is far too high and gave ambulance providers an excessive windfall, though he was willing to compromise to eliminate surprise billing. The governor commended the compromise.
“This rate was a result of compromise with the people behind me working incredibly hard to make sure that we’ve received a rate that is going to be able to sustain those services throughout our state,” Ayotte said Thursday, flanked by state lawmakers and EMS workers. “But one of the reasons we have the study is because we need to continuously evaluate that rate. As you know, costs change. Inflation can impact the cost. This is a very good compromise, and we’ll continue to evaluate it going forward, to make sure that we can sustain those services, and also to just make sure that patients have the services that they need.”
Chris Stawasz, Northeast regional director for American Medical Response and a vocal proponent of SB 245, said he’s not worried that the rate will fall dramatically lower than 350% when the actuarial study is complete after two years.
“New Hampshire is the 17th state, first in New England, to adopt this kind of legislation,” Stawasz said. “We have not seen any other state that’s gone down as a result of this.”
Asked how that squares with the actuarial study that’s already been completed that recommends a significantly lower rate, Stawasz argued that the previous study was flawed.
“We, as a group of providers, had some real issues with that study,” he said.
He said the study was completed in six months, “which is a really, really short period of time for a study like that” and said it looked at pre-pandemic data, “so we think it’s important to look at today’s data.”
“And let’s think about that,” Ayotte chimed in. “If the study’s done pre-COVID, if you look even in the context of inflationary costs, it kind of makes sense that it doesn’t have the most current data. So that’s the most important thing here. We want current data to evaluate where we are.”
However, the report from that study, which is available online, says it used data from a Medicaid database and the New Hampshire Comprehensive Health Care Information System, which reflected ambulance services from Jan. 1, 2022, through June 30, 2024. The pandemic was officially declared in March 2020. It’s unclear if the study mandated by SB 245 in two years will use the same methodology as this one.
The bill was praised by ambulance providers Thursday, including private EMS companies and fire departments that provide EMS.
“By eliminating unexpected ambulance billing, we are protecting the patients and families from financial strife during some of their most vulnerable moments,” Mike Sitar, Tilton-Northfield Fire District chief, said. “At the same time, the legislation recognizes the operational needs of all private and municipal service providers by guaranteeing minimum payments for the essential services they deliver.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AyotteSigningSB245-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky’s largest utility is proposing to delay the retirement of a coal-fired power plant unit and move forward with building billions of dollars of gas-fired power generation as part of a proposed settlement agreement before the state utility regulator.
The proposed settlement offered by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU) this week would build two new natural gas-fired power plants, each with a capacity of 645 megawatts, costing a total of more than $2.7 billion. Mill Creek 2, one of four coal-fired units at the utility’s Mill Creek Generating Station, would have its planned retirement delayed from 2027 until one of the new gas-fired power plants is operational in 2031.
The settlement is a part of a months-long case LG&E and KU brought before the Kentucky Public Service Commission requesting to build more fossil fuel-fired power generation that the utility says is needed to meet “unprecedented” projected energy demand driven by an influx of data centers. 
“As Kentucky’s largest regulated utilities, we have an obligation to serve all customers and new economic development load in the lowest reasonable cost manner. This agreement reflects the importance of that role and the critical needs addressed in our long-term generation investment plans,” said LG&E and KU president John Crockett in a released statement. 
The proposed settlement — which the commission could approve, deny or change — was agreed to by groups including Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers representing energy-intensive manufacturers; the Kentucky Coal Association; the Southern Renewable Energy Association; and Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who praised the settlement as promoting “affordable and reliable energy for Kentucky families.” 
“This agreement taps into Kentucky’s abundant natural resources and our ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy to power the commonwealth’s bright future,” said Coleman in a statement. “By securing our affordable energy future, we’ve also kept our commonwealth open for new business investment, job creation and economic growth.”
Coleman also touted the settlement for proposing to partially and temporarily offset the costs of one of the proposed gas-fired plants through revenues associated with data centers. 
However, intervenors in the case representing affordable housing advocates in Louisville, environmental stakeholders and others lambasted the settlement as saddling Kentuckians with billions of dollars of “costly, polluting infrastructure based on hypothetical future demand.” 
Byron Gary, an attorney for the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council representing the intervenors, in a statement said the settlement “prioritizes corporate interests over affordability, public health, and climate action.” 
Tony Curtis, the executive of the Metropolitan Housing Coalition in Louisville, one of the intervenors opposed to the settlement, in a statement said the “risk and cost” of building two new gas-fired power plants based on “speculative need is not in the best interest of ratepayers, especially low-and fixed-income residents.” 
Curtis said data centers driving the energy demand, not ratepayers, should bear the risk with proposed gas-fired generation.
Intervenors critical of the proposed settlement also stated they were disappointed in local governments for Louisville and Lexington not advocating for each cities’ goals to mitigate climate change. The two cities’ leaders agreed to not oppose the proposed settlement. A spokesperson for Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg did not provide a response to emailed questions about the proposed settlement. 
Susan Straub, a spokesperson for Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton, in an emailed statement said the city was “not comfortable with the level of additional power generation permitted in the settlement.” But the city did support other aspects of it, such LG&E and KU removing an additional request to build a utility-scale battery storage system. 
An influx of prospective data centers, some to power artificial intelligence services, has created a projected surge of demand for electricity across the country, though it’s unclear whether a number of proposed data centers will be built. Data centers have also driven an increase in electricity costs for ratepayers. 
The Kentucky Public Service Commission will begin a public hearing on LG&E and KU’s case and the proposed settlement Aug. 4 at 9 a.m. ET at its Frankfort office. The hearing will be broadcasted live on the agency’s YouTube channel.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5813-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

(Photo courtesy of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.)A former chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital is suing the federal government in an attempt to regain his asylum status. 
He said the government used a set of inaccurate claims and misinterpreted academic articles to revoke it in the first place. The academics themselves agreed, according to documents filed in a Cincinnati federal court last week. 
The story of Ayman Soliman has taken on a national profile since his July 9 arrest. 
He came legally to the United States in 2014 after he was beaten and tortured by Egypt’s totalitarian government for working with western journalists during the Arab Spring uprising, his lawyers said. 
Soliman was granted asylum in 2018, only to see the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service start the process of revoking it last December.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The government claimed that Soliman provided “material support” to a terrorist organization. 
The Muslim Brotherhood was the organization in question. However, Soliman didn’t belong to it, and it’s not designated by the United States as a terrorist organization.
In a motion to reinstate Soliman’s asylum status, his lawyer, Robert Ratliff, points out a key date the government got wrong in trying to revoke it.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services claimed that the Egyptian government designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization on Dec. 5, 2012. 
That didn’t actually happen until Dec. 25, 2013, and big changes happened in Egypt between the two dates. 
Soliman worked with al-Jameya al-Shareya, a group that coordinated community-level social services in a country where nearly a third of people live in poverty and government services are scant.
In 2011, Arab Spring uprisings toppled the long-time, authoritarian government of Hosni Mubarek. 
The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group, had a legally registered political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, or FJP, that participated in ensuing elections.
“The FJP were very successful in these elections, most notably when their candidate, Mohammed Morsi, won the two-round presidential elections in May/June 2012,” Steven Brooke, faculty director of Middle East Studies at the University of Wisconsin, wrote. 
“International election observers judged these contests as free and fair, and their results were accepted as valid by the international community, including the United States.”
During that time, Soliman’s group worked occasionally with the Muslim Brotherhood on community-level programs, but Brooke wrote that, “Individual instances of cooperation or overlap do not indicate that al-Jameya al-Shareya is organizationally allied to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
On July 3, 2013, a military junta staged a coup, jailed Morsi and later jailed Soliman for his work as a journalist. 
The repressive regime continues in power, with U.S. support.
“Significant numbers of individuals, both affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood and not, were killed, imprisoned without trial — or forced to flee the country,” Brooke wrote to the court. “As part of this crackdown, the Muslim Brotherhood was declared a terrorist organization in late December of 2013. Under this same military government, Egypt today is one of the most repressive and authoritarian countries in the region.”
Brooke was writing to the court to say that the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service had gotten its facts wrong, and was misusing his work in an attempt to deport Soliman.
“In brief, the documents incorrectly date the Muslim Brotherhood’s designation as a terrorist group by the Egyptian government by one year,” Brooke wrote. “The documents also treated the Egyptian government’s designation uncritically, and do not contextualize what ‘affiliation’ between the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Jameya al-Shareya represents.”
ICE continues to hold Ohio cleric. His defenders say the government’s claims are bogus

Marie Vannetzel, of France’s National Center for Scientific Research, also wrote the court on Soliman’s behalf.
 She said that in revoking Soliman’s refugee status, the Customs and Immigration Service lifted some of her work from its context — apparently intending to mislead.
Government lawyers quoted a sentence in the middle of a paragraph. The middle sentence said the Muslim Brotherhood under Anwar Sadat in the early 1990s was allowed to work with Soliman’s group, al-Jameya al-Shareya, until the brotherhood won a spot on the board. Then the board was dissolved, the sentence said.
But government lawyers left out sentences before and after saying that al-Jameya al-Shareya was a venerable, large “para-public” Islamic charity with many members who had nothing to do with the Muslim Brotherhood.
“I strongly disagree with the way these sentences are quoted and interpreted,” Vannetzel wrote. “I consider this a dishonest manipulation of my text and my work.”
In a separate development in Soliman’s case, an immigration judge denied his application to be released on bail. 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had argued that because he was accused of supporting a terrorist group, the immigration judge didn’t have jurisdiction to grant bail.
Immigration judges and their courts are not part of the judiciary. Instead, they’re administered by the Department of Justice, a part of an executive branch whose head is committed to mass deportations. Immigrant support groups say the arrangement is inherently unfair. 
For now, Soliman will continue to be jailed in Ohio under a U.S. district judge’s injunction. He’ll remain in the state at least until Aug. 14.

Renewal letters get lost in the mail, phone calls are missed and never returned, or verification paperwork is submitted but never processed. The result is the same: children lose coverage, and families lose access to the care their kids urgently need. 
For nearly 15 years, I’ve worked in Medicaid policy. Before joining GEEARS, I spent six years at a legal nonprofit serving Georgians with low incomes in the 154 counties outside of metro Atlanta. During that time, I answered dozens of calls each month from panicked parents and caregivers with the same heartbreaking concern: My child’s Medicaid was cut off even though we’re still eligible. 
Some moments have stuck with me:

A mother phoned from an emergency room. Her daughter had a broken leg, but the hospital refused to set it because her Medicaid had been terminated. They sent the child home with only pain medication.
A grandmother reached out in distress. Her grandson’s Medicaid had been cut off, and he hadn’t had his ADHD medication in months. He’d been suspended from school, and his grades were plummeting.
A mother, standing outside a surgery center, had just been told her daughter’s scheduled ear tube surgery was canceled. Medicaid was showing as inactive, even though they had submitted all the requested information.

In each case, the child was still eligible for coverage. These were not gaps in eligibility, but gaps in the system.
That’s why GEEARS: Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students has long advocated for Georgia to adopt a Medicaid waiver that would ensure continuous coverage for children from birth through age three. The earliest years of life are critical for brain development, and stable access to care during this time helps lay the foundation for long-term health and learning. Routine pediatric visits, immunizations, developmental screenings, and early interventions — all are essential in the first three years of life.
Continuous coverage would both support children and families and also reduce the strain on state agencies by minimizing the paperwork caseworkers must review.
Yet on July 17th, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a memo announcing that it would no longer approve or renew Section 1115 waivers that provide continuous Medicaid eligibility for young children. This decision puts in jeopardy the waivers already approved in nine states and several other states’ waiver proposals.
Georgia never submitted such a waiver, though the legislatively mandated Comprehensive Health Coverage Commission recommended pursuing one for children through age six in its report last December. Had it been implemented, the policy could have stabilized care for the nearly 50% of babies whose births are covered by Medicaid.
Last year, that amounted to over 60,000 babies — 60,000 little ones who deserve uninterrupted access to health care during the most important years of their development. This waiver offered a straightforward solution. By shutting down this option, CMS has blocked a critical path to improving early childhood health outcomes in Georgia and across the country. It’s a deeply disappointing decision that ultimately harms our nation’s most precious assets: our children.

It’s no surprise that State Rep. Carla Cunningham – a Democrat from Mecklenburg County — declined to speak with reporters this week after helping to override Gov. Stein’s veto of a mean-spirited and ill-conceived anti-immigrant bill.
That’s what often happens when a politician puts their foot in their mouth.
House Bill 318 will force local sheriffs – even when it makes their communities less safe—to cooperate with federal ICE officials in detaining people merely accused of criminal offenses.
It’s one of the ham-handed tactics the Trump administration has been using to terrorize immigrant communities and round up good people for deportation.
Unfortunately, all of this seems to have escaped Cunningham, who not only provided the decisive ‘yes’ vote, but who also gave an uninformed speech in which she accused immigrants of exploiting and abusing native born Americans and implied that immigrant cultures are inferior.
The bottom line: Cunningham embarrassed herself and her constituents – many of them foreign born – with her cruel rant. One prays she’ll awaken soon from her delusions.

Ned Lamont will not ask public colleges and universities to sacrifice further over the next year as his administration tries to achieve big efficiency savings ordered by legislators in the new state budget, officials said.
The governor’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, confirmed Tuesday that neither the University of Connecticut nor the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities system would be asked — at least initially — to forfeit any more money as they adjust to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal pandemic grants.
But that won’t be good news for other executive branch agencies. To keep spending under the constitutional cap, Lamont will have to find the $106 million in savings required by the legislature somewhere else — if higher education, which accounts for nearly one fifth of the annual budget, won’t absorb any of it.
“I’m grateful that the governor’s decided not to hold back any funding for CSCU and UConn institutions,” said Rep. Gregory Haddad, D-Mansfield, co-chairman of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, who added those units already have “a significant amount of cost-cutting to accomplish while trying to prioritize student services and maintain affordability.”
Higher education units, collectively, must do without about $270 million in federal pandemic grant funding that support their operations last fiscal year, which wrapped on June 30.
The General Assembly has struggled increasingly in recent years to adhere to a spending cap that keeps most state budget growth in line with household income or inflation.
The governor — a fiscal moderate — and his fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority have postponed a showdown over higher education funding since 2021 thanks to more than $2.8 billion in emergency pandemic relief Congress granted Connecticut through the American Rescue Plan Act [ARPA].
Faced with universities’ requests for more funding, the governor and lawmakers normally have two options: Deny those asks, risking programmatic cuts, tuition hikes, or both, or grant them, shifting resources — already limited by the cap — away from other programs. 
Instead, years ago, they chose a third option: assigning hundreds of millions in temporary ARPA dollars, which could be spent outside of the cap system, to cover ongoing higher education costs. 
But state officials knew those ARPA dollars would be exhausted by 2026 and that using them to cover recurring expenses was a ticking fiscal time bomb, a huge hole that eventually would have to be filled some other way.
Lamont says universities should have done more to prepare for the eventual loss of those funds. But higher ed officials sought that support, at numerous public hearings and meetings, to cover regular operations, and many legislators say everyone, including Lamont administration officials, understood this.
But Lamont faces his own fiscal challenges.
The $27.2 billion spending plan legislators set for the fiscal year that began July 1 directs the Executive Branch, which oversees the bulk of spending, to achieve $106 million in savings once the budget is in force. 
Governors traditionally meet these savings targets by spreading the pain among dozens of state agencies, holding back a share of their allotments. And by exempting higher education, Lamont is taking a big piece of the budget pie out of the cost-saving exercise.
UConn expects to spend almost $3.7 billion this fiscal year on its main campus in Storrs, its regional campuses and its Farmington health center combined.
The CSCU system, which includes four regional universities, 12 community colleges and the online Charter Oak State College, has a $1.2 billion budget.
Together, the spending plans for these public colleges and universities represent almost one-fifth of the entire state budget.
Collibee added that while there are no plans to reduce funds for higher education now, things could change. 
“The administration may still choose to apply the remaining holdback authority, including potentially in higher education, if we believe spending or revenue trends warrant that action this fiscal year,” he said.
That was the situation this past fiscal year. 
Lamont initially exempted higher education from helping him meet a $209 million efficiency savings target for 2024-25. But the administration reversed itself in late March after the General Assembly went against Lamont’s wishes and ordered a supplemental $40 million increase in special education grants for K-12 school districts.
Legislators said the funding was crucial and that a growing gap between the demand for special education needs and local resources to cover them was pushing district school budgets into crisis.
Lamont, who had proposed boosting special education aid by $40 million — but not until July 2026 — countered that the state budget already was on pace to exceed the budget cap and that legislators needed to make tough choices and trim spending.
The two sides eventually agreed to send the extra $40 million to school districts right away, using a technical accounting maneuver, which Lamont traditionally has decried, to skirt the spending cap issue. 
The administration responded by ordering about $41 million in spending reductions across numerous state agencies, including $6 million from public colleges and universities. 
Higher education units hope to avoid a situation like that this year and are taking steps to adjust to the loss of ARPA dollars.
The CSCU system came under fire last spring when the Connecticut Mirror disclosed it held more than $600 million in reserves, a huge cushion equal to roughly half its operating budget.
UConn’s budgetary safety net was more modest last spring, involving about $170 million for the Storrs and regional campuses and about $300 million for the health center.
But all higher ed units are beginning to spend their reserves.
The CSCU system expects to dedicate $162 million to support the budget and mitigate program cuts, according to spokeswoman Samantha Norton.
UConn officials still are working on various cost-cutting initiatives, but spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said as much as $38 million in reserves could be used to support the main and regional campuses and another $62 million to bolster the health center’s budget. 
Both Haddad and Sen. Derek Slap, D-West Hartford, the other co-chair of the higher education committee, called for higher education units to reduce their reserves last spring.
Slap also praised Lamont this week for not asking higher education to forfeit funds to meet the budgetary savings mandate.
“The state can’t backfill everything, but I think to not subject them to holdbacks right now is a good thing, especially considering what’s coming down the road,” Slap said, predicting recent federal spending cuts ordered by Congress and President Donald Trump would take a heavy toll on research grants and other programs that support higher education.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CCSU-2.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The Ohio legislature may have finished its work on the state operating budget, but when it returns from summer break, another significant piece of work lies ahead of them.
The congressional map that establishes voting districts for Ohio’s U.S. House representatives must be redrawn before the end of the year. State lawmakers’ first deadline is approaching in September, and maps must be in place for 2026 primary elections. 
The process dictated by the Ohio Constitution starts in the legislature. The General Assembly gets first crack at drawing the districts.
According to a legislative brief on the process, each chamber has to come up with agreement from three-fifths of the members to achieve a bipartisan map, including at least half of the Republicans and Democrats in the chambers.
If the legislature can’t come to an agreement, the Ohio Redistricting Commission is reactivated to take over the process.
That commission is made up of the governor, the auditor of state, the secretary of state, and individual lawmakers appointed by the House Speaker, Senate President, Senate Minority Leader, and House Minority Leader.
Ohio Republican politicians currently hold five out of the seven Ohio Redistricting Commission seats.
Both Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman and Ohio Senate President Rob McColley have sat on the commission previously: Huffman in his former role as Senate President, and McColley as an appointee of Huffman.
The commission has a month to come up with a bipartisan plan. If the commission also can’t come to an agreement, the process returns to the legislature, which then has until Nov. 30 to come up with a map.
If a bipartisan map is agreed upon, that map will last 10 years, but if the commission doesn’t have bipartisan agreement, or if the legislature passes a map by a simple majority vote, the map only lasts for four years.
In comments made to reporters during the budget process in June, Huffman said a positive note for this go-round with congressional redistricting is that the state already has the data, rather than having to wait for a census count to be completed.
He said the procedure that’s spelled out in the state constitution may begin with negotiations as early as August.
“I think there will be some, probably, informal negotiations starting in August with the idea that it may be possible to have a bipartisan bill in September,” Huffman said. “If that doesn’t happen, the redistricting commission will meet in October, and if the commission doesn’t come up with a bill, then in November, the legislature’s required by Nov. 30 to file a redistricting bill.”
A spokesperson for Ohio Senate President McColley said discussions about next steps in the process haven’t started yet in that chamber.
A history of redistricting
The process of redistricting has been a fraught one in the state since the 2020 U.S. Census, which marked 10 years since the last redistricting process.
Redistricting typically happens in line with the decennial census, so that state leaders who draw the maps have the most recent data on population shifts and trends in Ohio.
The layout of the state in redistricting maps should align with the voting trends in the state.
In 2024, President Donald Trump won with 55% of the vote compared to 44% for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno defeated former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown with 50.09% of the vote compared to 46.47% for Brown.
An average of partisan statewide elections over the last 10 years has Republicans getting 55% of the votes compared to 44% for Democrats.
Currently, Republicans control 66% of Ohio’s U.S. Congressional districts, holding 10 seats compared to five seats held by Democrats.
Moreno has suggested Ohio Republican politicians should draw districts that favor Republicans 12-3, giving them 80% of districts.
During the last round of congressional redistricting in 2021, the two congressional maps that were adopted by Republicans on the Ohio Redistricting Commission were both struck down by a 4-3 bipartisan Ohio Supreme Court majority as unconstiutionally favoring the Republican Party.
At the time of that court, elections for the Ohio Supreme Court were nonpartisan. Republican lawmakers added partisan labels to state supreme court races beginning in 2022. Since then, Republican candidates have swept court races and Republicans now hold Ohio Supreme Court seats 6-1. The remaining Democratic justice on the court, Jennifer Brunner, faces a challenge from Republican Justice Patrick Fischer in 2026.
Even after the second map was struck down by the state’s high court in 2021, however, no changes were made, and the second unconstitutional map remained in place for the 2022 election cycle.
The Ohio Supreme Court will continue to take up all challenges and decide on the constitutionality of the maps this time around.

While current Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy was not chief justice at the time, she, DeWine and Fischer all supported the commission-adopted maps, going against the majority court’s decision that the maps were unconstitutional.
Despite his father, Gov. Mike DeWine, sitting on the commission, Justice Pat DeWine did not recuse himself from the redistricting cases.
During the last round of redistricting, then-Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor served as the swing vote on every redistricting decision.
Forced to retire from the court due to age restriction, Connor then went on to join the movement to change the process, serving as a leader in a campaign in 2024 to amend the Ohio Constitution to remove politicians from the process of drawing districts.
Supporters of the measure wanted to see a citizen-led commission drawing the maps and what advocates saw as a more transparent and publicly accountable process.
After Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board used their positions to write ballot language for the proposal telling voters that the anti-gerrymandering amendment would require gerrymandering, voters rejected the amendment. Many Ohio voters expressed confusion about the issue before, on, and after Election Day.

(Photo by Jack Yen Joy Photography/Getty Images)During the Fourth of July holiday, I took some time to reflect both on the freedoms brought by independence and on the dramatic shifts in the role of government likely to be felt by many as a result of the federal “mega bill.”
The law enacts significant changes in public policy legislation and budget expenditures for the coming fiscal year and the decade ahead. In a recent blog post, the NH Health Cost Initiative has made it dramatically clear the impact the new law — and the new New Hampshire budget — will have on the health care delivery system in New Hampshire: “… the landscape of health care in New Hampshire is shifting, sometimes rapidly, and not always equitably. At the same time, federal and state budget debates fuel uncertainty for what the future of health care will look like and who will be able to afford it.”
Changes and uncertainty, especially in health care, are coming, if not already here, as a result of the current political and economic environment, both nationally and within the state. These changes and their impacts have been identified in a number of recent reports and news releases:

The federal government’s new tax and spending cut law reduces tax revenue support and SNAP benefits going to states, which affects states’ ability to provide a social safety for needy individuals and families. 
Medical costs, rising faster than expected, will likely lead to more expensive insurance premiums.
Severe reductions in funding supports for Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare subsidies are set to end this year) will mean fewer individuals and families will have health insurance coverage, affecting providers, rural hospitals, and likely increasing insurance costs for employers, and private and self-insured health policy holders.
An increased administrative burden, with no financial supports, will be placed on individuals and health care administrators due to the implementation of new federal and state rules and regulations leading to fewer direct services, more uncompensated care for providers, and longer wait times for patients.
Our New Hampshire state budget, which went into effect July 1, is strained. New fees have been added and budget cuts required by the Legislature have been requested of many departments, affecting health and mental health care, social services, food supports, and child care. Combined with federal cuts from the mega law, greater economic and social burdens will be placed on individuals, families, businesses, and nonprofits, where, in a number of cases, demand outstrips capacity.

If nothing is done differently in response to these environmental conditions and budget changes then, on the horizon, health care will cost even more than it does now. We will also see reduced access to services, leading to less revenue for health providers, more administrative burdens, longer wait lists, a shrinking workforce, poorer quality care, more emergency room visits, delayed care, and poorer health outcomes.
Or these conditions can be an opportunity for charting a new path forward to a “whole person system of care” that is affordable, accessible, equitable, and high quality, and aligns with patient non-medical social needs.
When times are tough, I have learned that responsible Granite Staters with strong community values and who believe we are all in this together will step up to meet the challenges with fair solutions that help everyone. Now is such a time. We have to work together to make a new future out of what is before us.
In New Hampshire, there are health care leaders, researchers, advocates, regulators, providers, and talented stakeholders already at work trying to build an affordable and equitable health care system. I think they are ready to do more, bring others into the fold, and help lead us forward through turbulent times to a system of care that assures a healthier New Hampshire.
One approach these leaders can take, which would be beneficial for many, is to put energy into implementing primary care “medical homes,” which incorporate behavioral health and substance use treatments and coordinate access to specialty care, allied services, and utilized community health care worker services.
Medical homes — integrated primary care models — have been shown to cost less while providing comprehensive services and are easier to access by the community. Under an umbrella of accountable care driven by a value-based payment model, these homes can promote patient-centered, cost-effective care, competing effectively in the marketplace.
Health care leaders can work with legislators, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General’s Office, the Insurance Department, and leaders from Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) to recommend legislation for the consolidation of services across the state’s FQHCs (and look-a-likes) and CMHCs. Or, in addition, CMHCs can become Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC), a specially designated clinic that provides a comprehensive range of mental health and substance use services, including coordination with primary care and social services (non-medical drivers of health).
An integrated health care delivery system, medical homes, or CCBHCs, can be set up to serve anyone who walks through the door, regardless of their diagnosis and insurance status.
This integration might allow for the more effective and efficient use of resources to address the needs of New Hampshire’s most vulnerable populations, including those with chronic illnesses and serious mental health conditions. They can address greater control over pricing, services, staffing, and operations.
These comprehensive, integrated health care models could also help improve health equity, align with social service needs of patients, and provide protection from hospital corporations or private equity firms that might want to swoop in and consolidate PCP and/or mental health services. It may also allow for greater strength in negotiating with insurance companies and protecting rural hospitals from closure.
The scope of work will not be easy to develop, implement, finance, and assess. All this will take time for stakeholders to come to agreement, align their interests and desires, and form coalitions to assure that New Hampshire has an affordable health care system that meets the needs of all its residents.
It will, most assuredly, take committed leadership, effective and civil communication, and trust.
Coming together, understanding one another, working in coalitions, and working in agreement and in collaboration on a direction for health care requires trust.
NHHCI states: “Our goal is clear — to engage diverse perspectives in developing policy solutions that make health care more affordable, more transparent, and more accessible for Granite Staters.”
New Hampshire must change the way it delivers health care. Can we meet this new challenge? Can we trust one another?
I think New Hampshire’s thoughtful health leaders, patient advocates, researchers, providers, policy makers, and government leaders have made the right decisions in the past and they can do so now.
They can work together and lead us to a healthier New Hampshire, where all can thrive.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hospitalcorridor-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 05:56:52.012810

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ohio Equal Rights, the group behind the amendments, originally had one proposed amendment, but the Ohio Ballot Board decided a few weeks ago their proposal actually contained two amendments. 
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said some voters could support removing Ohio’s ban on gay marriage from the constitution, but not want to add protections to all those groups of people.
“We still think splitting the amendment creates unnecessary hurdles,” Lis Regula, executive co-chair of Ohio Equal Rights, said in a statement. “But we still think moving forward is our best shot.” 
Ohio Equal Rights could have challenged the ruling in the Ohio Supreme Court, but decided instead to move forward as two separate amendments. The Republicans hold a 6-1 majority on the Ohio Supreme Court.
“It could take months, if not years to appeal the decision in court,” Regula said in a statement. “Moving forward, even though it is double the signatures and paperwork, it is the best shot we have at securing equality for every Ohioan in a timely manner.” 
Ohio Equal Rights said their attorneys are writing up summaries, titles, and petitions for Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to certify. Once Yost certifies the petitions, Ohio Equal Rights can starting collecting signatures. 
They will need to collect about 413,487 signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties — 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election — for each amendment in order to get on the ballot. LaRose will then need to verify the signatures. 
Ohio’s constitution includes a ban on same-sex marriage after 61.7% of Ohio voters approved an amendment in 2004 that says marriage is only between one man and one woman. The United States Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015 through the Obergefell case originating out of Ohio. 
However, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called on justices to revisit Obergefell after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
The 2026 ballot will also include the governor’s race and other statewide executive offices.

Jon Husted, left, and Bernie Moreno, center, and Vice President JD Vance, right. (Official photos.)Ohioans continue to raise concerns that they will lose their health care access or food assistance benefits now that Congress’s massive spending bill has been signed into law.
All of Ohio’s U.S. House Republican representatives voted for the law, as did Ohio Republican U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, and Ohio native Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate.
For one Ohio woman, Medicaid is the reason she says she is alive.
From doctor offices, to food banks, to being unhoused for two years, Clevelander Autumn La Riche said she has been trying to survive.
“Nobody wants to be stuck in poverty and disabled all the time,” La Riche said.
Suffering from multiple chronic illnesses that impact her mobility and pain, she had to leave her job as an educator, relying on services like Medicaid.
Right now, she qualifies for disability but fears that changes to the program due to what the GOP calls the “Big Beautiful Bill” will cause her and people like her to suffer.
“If I don’t have health care, how am I ever gonna get better and return to work?” she said.
By mid-July, La Riche said she had been calling the offices of Sens. Moreno and Husted about her concerns each week — for months. She never got to talk to anyone, at least nothing more than an automated message, she said.
“I can’t lose my services because I don’t know what I would do,” she said.
Medicaid funding has been cut, and there are additional work and reporting requirements. Now, most able-bodied individuals ages 19 to 64 would need to work at least 80 hours per month.
Republicans like Vice President Vance claim that this will bring down spending.
“The best way to protect Medicaid is to ensure only the needy get access to Medicaid,” the VP said Monday at an event in Canton.
There were also major changes to the work requirement exemptions for food stamps, SNAP — eliminating veterans and people facing homelessness from the exceptions list.
The bill also increases the work requirements for the elderly. It raises the age for work requirements up to 64, and changes exemptions for parents to only those with children under 14.
The GOP says these types of governmental service changes are all to make the systems work more efficiently.
“If you’re looking for work, we’re gonna help you look for work,” Vance said.
Dylan Armstrong with nonpartisan Center for Community Solutions shared one impact that the new reporting aspect could have.
“By adding additional paperwork and additional bureaucracy, it will make it more difficult for individuals to either receive benefits or continue to receive benefits,” Armstrong said.
The paperwork struggle is real for La Riche, who lost her SNAP benefits when she faced homelessness. Still, her top worry is her medical care.
Vance was asked what he says to the hundreds of thousands of Ohioans facing a potential loss in health care coverage.
“Well, what I’d say to those Ohioans is one, don’t believe every false media report that you’ve heard because our explicit goal in the Trump administration is to protect people’s health care so long as they’re working hard, playing by the rules… What I’d say to people is ‘If you’re looking for work, we’re gonna help you look for work,'” Vance responded.
Watch the entire exchange:
After we reached out to the offices of both Ohio senators, La Riche said they called her back.
“Assisting Ohioans in need is Senator Moreno’s top priority. While the Senate has been dealing with an exceptionally high volume of calls, our office is committed to responding to each and every Ohioan in need of assistance and working through all requests as quickly as possible,” said Moreno’s spokesperson Reagan McCarthy said in a statement. “It’s a shame Democrat dark money groups have decided their petty political projects are more important than the needs of our constituents.”
La Riche said she told them this message: “You have no idea what is too much or not enough, if you have never lived with chronic illness, if you have never fought the disability system, if you have never had to fight for resources just to survive and live one day.”

(Harald Tittel/Picture Alliance via Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s first term saw a record-high rate of turnover among his Cabinet members and chief advisers. Trump’s second term has, to date, seen far fewer Cabinet departures.
But some political commentators have observed that the president this time around has primarily appointed loyal advisers who will not challenge him.
As Thomas Friedman pointed out in The New York Times on June 3, 2025, “In Trump I, the president surrounded himself with some people of weight who could act as buffers. In Trump II, he has surrounded himself only with sycophants who act like amplifiers.”
As a scholar of Greco-Roman antiquity, I have spent many years studying the demise of truth-telling in periods of political upheaval. Spanning the period from 27 B.C.E. to 476 C.E., the Roman Empire still offers insights into what happens to political leaders when they interpret possibly helpful advice as dissent.
Particularly telling is the case of Nero, Rome’s emperor from 54 to 68 C.E., who responded to a disastrous fire in 64 with extreme cruelty and self-worship that did nothing to help desperate citizens.
 
Suppressing honest advice under Nero
Rome’s first emperor, Augustus, established a handpicked circle of advisers — called the consilium principis in Latin, meaning emperor’s council — to give a republican look to his autocratic regime. Augustus became the emperor of Rome in 27 B.C.E. and ruled over the empire, which stretched from Europe and North Africa to the Middle East at its peak, until his death in 14 C.E.
Augustus wanted to hear what others thought about the empire’s needs and his policies. At least some of Augustus’ advisers were bold enough to assert themselves and risk incurring his displeasure. Some, such as Cornelius Gallus, paid for their boldness with their own lives, while others, such as Cilnius Maecenas, managed to push their political agendas in softer ways that allowed them to maintain influence.
But the Roman emperors who came after Augustus were either less skilled at maintaining a republican facade, or less interested in doing so.
Nero was the last of the emperors from the noble Julio-Claudian dynasty in ancient Rome at its peak of power. Historians who describe Nero’s rise and fall from power describe the first five years of his reign, or the quinquennium neronis in Latin, as a period of relative calm and prosperity for the empire.
Because Nero was just 16 years old when he acceded to power, he was assigned advisers to guide his policies. Their opinions carried significant weight.
But five years into his reign, chafing at their continued oversight, Nero began to purge these advisers from his life, via execution, forced suicide and exile.
Nero instead collected a small cadre of self-interested enablers who derived power for themselves by encouraging their leader’s delusions, such as his desire to project himself as the incarnation of the sun god, Apollo.
The single most unspeakably corrupt and nefarious of these preferred advisers was Ofonius Tigellinus. Tigellinus had caught Nero’s eye early in 62 by urging the senate to convict a Roman magistrate of treason for having composed poems that he deemed insulting to the emperor. Later that year, Tigellinus was appointed the head of the emperor’s personal army.
As praetorian prefect, Tigellinus was charged not only with protecting Nero from physical harm, but also with crafting and guarding the leader’s public image. Tigellinus urged Nero to stage an ongoing series of public spectacles — like theatrical performances and athletic competitions — that featured him as a divine ruler and a god on Earth.
 
Up in flames
It was likely at Tigellinus’ urging that, in the aftermath of the great fire of 64 that raged for six days in Rome, Nero staged an exorbitant garden party where Christians were soaked in flammable oils and lit as human torches to illuminate a decadent late-night feast.
But, try as he might, Nero couldn’t outrun the fire and its aftermath by indulging in clever cruelties. Huge swathes of the city had been razed by the fire. Thousands of citizens lacked clothing. They were hungry, displaced and homeless.
For answers, the fire’s countless victims looked to Nero, their earthly Apollo, for help. But they did not encounter a sympathetic leader sweeping in to address their needs. Instead, they found a man desperate to place blame on others — in this case, foreigners from the east.
In order to squelch rumors that Nero had lit the fire, Tigellinus’ army unit rounded up Christians, falsely blamed them for starting the fire and executed them.
But this move just showcased Nero’s failure to focus on the dire needs of the poor, the very people who worshipped him. Instead, he sought to rise above the ashes by doubling down on his divine pretensions.
Once the rubble left by the fire was cleared away, Nero built a magnificent new home for himself. This palace, called the domus aurea in Latin, meaning house of gold, covered more than 120 acres in the heart of Rome. It featured spectacular water fountains, elaborate works of art and, standing tall in the entryway, a 120-foot bronze statue of Nero as the sun god, Apollo.
No truth-teller was there to tell Nero that maybe he shouldn’t rub his people’s noses in their suffering.
Nero’s delusional response to the fire did not put an end to his career, but it did much to hasten its end.
Less than four years later, with armies bearing down on the city, Nero committed suicide. Rome tumbled into civil war.
 
Self-worship in the Trump era

Trump has long expressed a desire to have his face carved on Mount Rushmore, a national memorial in South Dakota that features the likenesses of legendary American presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.
This dream became a bit closer to reality when Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles in July 2025 urged the Department of the Interior to explore adding Trump’s image to Mount Rushmore — even though such an addition might not be possible because of geological issues.
Trump’s critics have long noted the president’s propensity to focus on himself and his own greatness and power, rather than the needs of citizens.
As far away as the Roman Empire might seem, Nero’s rise and fall offers a lesson in what can happen when honest criticism of a political leader is sidelined in favor of idolatry.
Instead of honest solutions to real problems, what Romans got was a colossal statue that portrayed their leader as a god on Earth.

(Screenshot/Wisconsin DNR)The Wisconsin District I Court of Appeals ruled against former state Natural Resources Board Chair Frederick Prehn this week in a case over a public records request filed while Prehn was refusing to vacate his seat on the board. 
Prehn, a Wausau dentist, was appointed to the NRB by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker to a term that was supposed to expire in May 2021. Despite his term’s expiration, Prehn announced he would refuse to step down, preventing Democratic Gov. Tony Evers from appointing his replacement and flipping ideological control of the board, which sets policy for the Department of Natural Resources. 
Emails obtained through public records requests showed that Prehn was working with legislative Republicans to remain in his seat and maintain influence over state policies on controversial issues such as wolf hunting and water quality standards. 
Prehn ultimately remained on the board for 20 months past the expiration of his term. 
While he was refusing to leave, Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a public records request seeking all communications Prehn made about his refusal to leave — including emails and text messages made on public and personal devices or accounts. Through the DNR, Prehn turned over emails relevant to request but not text messages. A second records request by MEA to another Republican member of the board showed that Prehn had been texting about his decision. 
MEA sued in Dane County Circuit Court to have those text messages released. The circuit court found that Prehn had improperly withheld the text messages and a schedule was set for him to turn over those records. 
MEA filed a motion requesting that Prehn pay damages and attorney’s fees. The circuit court denied that motion under a 2022 state Supreme Court decision which found if a government agency voluntarily turns over records while a lawsuit for those records is pending, the government does not have to pay attorney’s fees to the requesting party. 
That decision, Friends of Frame Park v. Waukesha, has drawn criticism from legislators from both parties and a bill to negate the decision has been working its way through the Legislature. 
On Tuesday, the appeals court ruled that Prehn’s text messages count as public records and therefore should have been turned over under the state’s open records law. The court majority rejected  Prehn’s contention that the texts were about his “purely personal” decision to remain in office. The court also overturned the circuit court decision not to award MEA attorney’s fees. 
“This decision is a win for the people of Wisconsin. It strengthens our democracy by ensuring that government officials conduct their business with openness and transparency,” MEA attorney Adam Voskuil said. “Had Prehn’s arguments been accepted, the public records law and our state’s commitment to open government would have been significantly weakened.”

Victoria Gomez de la Torre doesn’t know when — or if — the migrant children she serves are going to get the education help they’ve come to rely on.
Gomez de la Torre oversees the migrant education program for 12 central Florida counties. The federally funded service helps the children of migrant agricultural workers, who move within and between states based on planting and harvesting seasons.
Her staff identifies agricultural workers who’ve migrated to the area and helps them enroll their children in school. It also helps connect them with tutoring and medical care.
Earlier this summer, the Trump administration froze more than $6 billion in education funding, including money for migrant education, after-school programs, English-language programs for non-native speakers and other grants. Congress had already approved the money, but the administration said it wanted to conduct a review of the programs.
The administration announced last Friday it would release the remaining $5.5 billion of the money, after unfreezing $1.3 billion earlier this month.
But for Gomez de la Torre’s program, the damage had already been done: Without the money, it had to shut down this summer.
‘Invisible’ migrant farmworkers cope with hurricane’s aftermath

“We didn’t have enough money left over to carry the program,” said Joram Rejouis, the director of program development for the public schools in Alachua County, which includes Gainesville and is the largest of the 12 counties. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage.”
The program came to a complete halt when Gomez de la Torre’s 11 staff members were offered other positions in the school district. Throughout July, about five dozen migrant children across the 12 counties were without summer services. The funds were supposed to go out before the start of the month.
“It’s going horrendously,” said Gomez de la Torre. “Migrant families depend on us, rely on our system and our help.”
The Alachua County program serves about 1,000 to 1,200 children of migrant workers throughout the year, many in rural farming communities. Each year, roughly 17,000 migrant children are served by programs across Florida.
“It is a very valuable program for a very vulnerable population,” Rejouis said. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.”
Migrant children are less likely to have regular primary care and are more likely to face health conditions such as anemia and high blood pressure. Many migrant families who harvest food in the fields don’t have enough food themselves.
The program also helps with communication and translation among parents, teachers and guidance counselors. “We were their go-to for whenever they needed something,” Gomez de la Torre said. “Now, they don’t have us.”










Stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.

The freeze in funds added to the uncertainty and fear created by the Trump administration’s broader moves to target benefits for immigrants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently announced it had added Head Start to the list of public programs that would be closed to immigrants who are here illegally. After the funding announcement earlier this month, a senior official said the administration had established “guardrails” to ensure the funds are not used “in violation of Executive Orders.”
“It’s anybody’s guess when we’ll come back,” Gomez de la Torre said. “If we’ll come back. If people who chose to retire will return, if their retirement can be rescinded. … Nobody knows exactly how it’s going to play out.”
A similar story is unfolding in California.
The statewide Mini Corps program, run by the Butte County Office of Education, north of Sacramento, connects migrant children at schools and labor camps with bilingual tutors who help them during the school day. Many of the tutors are former migrant children themselves, said Yvette Medina, who oversees the program.
The funding freeze forced the office to lay off around 400 workers statewide, according to spokesperson Travis Souders. Despite Friday’s announcement, the organization is waiting for official word — in writing — before reversing layoffs.
“There’s going to be many students out there who are just going to have another disadvantage to the disadvantages that we already have,” Medina said.
In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, the program was forced to shut down altogether, according to Medina.
Medina grew up in migrant labor camps, following her parents to the fields at 4 a.m. as they picked cherries and grapes before she went to school. Her parents worked throughout the Central Valley, back in Mexico and up and down the West Coast, all the way to Oregon.
“It is devastating,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the migrant program, I know for a fact there’s no way I would have graduated high school.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Migrant families already are gripped with fear as the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids and arrests, which President Donald Trump insists are focused on those with criminal histories.
“They are terrified,” Gomez de la Torre said. “We had families stop sending kids to school and others who fled the country.”
Ruby Luis, a consultant who helps school districts across Florida identify and enroll migrant students in school, also was a migrant child. Her parents worked in orange groves, at strawberry and Christmas tree farms and produce-packing houses.
Program tutors read books with her and gave her school supplies. The program took her on college tours and she enrolled via a scholarship for migrant children — a first-generation college student. She eventually graduated with a degree in biology.
“Just having even somebody to talk to you about going to college — because you don’t have anybody to talk to about [that],” she said. “Having that support was really impactful.
“To take that away, and then now they just have to navigate it themselves, it creates these barriers,” Luis said. “And it can ultimately leave these children not having access to education.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.)How much could an unusual mid-decade redistricting push matter for control of Congress next year?
Experts are split, but generally see little advantage in the frantic activity by both parties to squeeze extra seats from lines that already favor Republicans in Texas and Florida and Democrats in California.
Texas Republicans proposed a new set of maps Wednesday, in response to a request from President Donald Trump to boost GOP numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives by redrawing the lines to favor Republicans. Left-leaning California, meanwhile, has pledged to retaliate by redrawing its congressional districts to create more Democratic seats.
The unusual plan to draw new districts in mid-decade for political purposes is not unprecedented — Republicans in Colorado and Texas moved to redraw districts after taking unified control of those states in 2002. But generally, states draw new districts only when federal law requires it after a new decennial census.
Trump reportedly asked Texas Republicans to target five Democratic incumbents to shore up their thin U.S. House majority against anticipated losses in midterm elections next year. He also pressured Missouri Republicans to redraw a Democratic Kansas City-area district. Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he would follow suit.
California has threatened a retaliatory plan to increase Democratic seats there and a Democratic super PAC has created a $20 million fund to target Texas Republicans next year as payback.
It’s not impossible for Texas to come up with five more Republican seats that would withstand legal challenge, said J. Miles Coleman, political cartographer at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. But Coleman said it would take some “creative line drawing.”

Paul Brace, an emeritus professor of legal studies science at Rice University in Houston, said the proposed Texas maps released today target Democrats in majority-minority districts in Houston, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and South Texas, where Trump showed surprising strength in last year’s election.
“They’re trying to dilute those areas with more white Republican areas to give themselves a better chance,” said Brace. He said he’s skeptical Texas Republicans can draw five more GOP seats that will withstand legal scrutiny, though they might be able to get one by redrawing the Houston-area district that has been unrepresented since Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner died in March.
Other changes are not as clear-cut, he said.
Kimball Brace, a redistricting expert and consultant in Virginia who is not related to Paul Brace, said Texas might have already reached its maximum number of GOP seats.
“The question about Texas is, are they already maxed out for Republican strength? There’s not much wiggle room left,” he said.
Kimball Brace said there may be some benefit to Republicans in redrawing South Texas districts, where Republican strength was greater than expected last year, but there’s nothing like five seats in play. He said he thinks California is in a similar situation, since for decades, California Democrats have drawn maps to maximize their advantage and might not have much more room to maneuver.
Coleman disagreed, saying he sees opportunities in both states for new seats.
“For the purposes of keeping score, Texas and California could basically cancel each other out. But I think Democrats would be hurt if the redistricting wars escalate beyond those states,” Coleman said.
Florida and Missouri could add more Republican seats, and theoretically Colorado, New York and Virginia could add more Democratic seats, but the Democratic states will run into self-imposed obstacles like redistricting commissions that limit partisan maneuvers, Coleman said. Republican-dominated Ohio will also be a factor, since it’s planning to redraw districts because of court fights.
“That will almost certainly be to the benefit of Republicans, so it’s another example of  Republicans having more levers to pull than Democrats,” Coleman said. .
Earlier this week, New York unveiled its own mid-decade redistricting plan, but it wouldn’t take effect in time for next year’s midterm elections.
Kimball Brace said Michigan, where he has worked as a consultant, could add more Democratic seats in theory, but a fragile compromise on a politically independent redistricting commission makes it unlikely.
Parties in power generally draw districts that favor their own with methods known as “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to concentrating opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means scattering opposition voters across districts, so they have little chance to influence votes.
Texas and Florida already have wrung more partisan advantage from their congressional seats than any other states, by one measure.
PlanScore, a project at Harvard Law School’s Election Law Clinic that measures bias in redistricting, found at least some partisan bias in congressional districts in many states where data on voter registration was available.
About two of California’s 52 U.S. House seats are Democratic but would be Republican under a perfectly balanced plan based on statewide party registration. Texas already squeezes about five extra Republican seats out of its 32 U.S. House districts, one of the most skewed maps in the country. Florida has an extra four GOP seats, out of 28 total.

The suspensions affect hundreds of UCLA grants and come days after Trump’s Department of Justice concluded in an investigation that “Jewish and Israeli students at UCLA were subjected to severe” harassment. 


The Trump administration is suspending hundreds of science research grants at UCLA in response to a Justice Department finding this week that the campus didn’t do enough to halt antisemitism during last year’s pro-Palestine protests.“UCLA received a notice that the federal government, through its control of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies, is suspending certain research funding to UCLA,” the university chancellor, Julio Frenk, wrote in a public letter Thursday evening. 
Frenk, whose Jewish paternal grandparents and young father fled Nazi Germany, faulted the Trump administration for punishing science in its effort to combat “alleged discrimination.”
“With this decision, hundreds of grants may be lost, adversely affecting the lives and life-changing work of UCLA researchers, faculty and staff. In its notice to us, the federal government claims antisemitism and bias as the reasons. This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,” Frenk wrote.
The scale of the suspensions is unclear. At least 278 grants funded by the National Science Foundation are suspended in a move that affects about $212 million in research projects, some that have been ongoing since 2019 or earlier. That’s according to Grant Witness, a project by a team of scholars that began tracking the Trump administration’s research funding cuts.
Officials and spokespersons from the National Science Foundation didn’t respond to emails from CalMatters about why the grants were suspended“With the support of the UC Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President, we are actively evaluating our best course of action,” Frenk wrote. His letter outlined the various steps the campus has taken to combat antisemitism and anti-Israel bias on campus.
Trump’s DOJ alleges antisemitism 
The suspensions are the first known consequence of the U.S. Department of Justice issuing UCLA a notice of violation for failing “to adequately respond to complaints of severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment and abuse that Jewish and Israeli students faced on its campus from October 7, 2023, to the present,” a statement from the department said.The findings largely concern the pro-Palestinian encampments that hundreds of students and faculty erected last spring to protest Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza as part of the majority-Jewish nation’s war with Hamas. Hamas, which dozens of countries — including the U.S. — call a terrorist group but that is also the ruling government of the Gaza Strip, attacked Israeli civilians and soldiers on Oct. 7, 2023, reigniting a decades-long conflict between the two powers.The Justice Department’s investigation said that “Jewish and Israeli students at UCLA were subjected to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment that created a hostile environment by members of the encampment.” It also said that UCLA officials “had notice that Jewish and Israeli students were being assaulted and physically prevented from accessing parts of campus by demonstrators.”The Justice Department letter indicated that UCLA’s leadership last year was “deliberately indifferent to the hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students caused by the encampment.” The letter also faulted UCLA officials for failing to disband the encampment even though its creation violated existing campus policies, as CalMatters reported.The letter was signed by the U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gregory W. Brown. They told UCLA it has until Aug. 5 to agree to a voluntary settlement to “ensure that the hostile environment is eliminated and reasonable steps are taken to prevent its recurrence.” Otherwise, the Department of Justice “is prepared” to file a complaint against UCLA in a federal court in September, the Department of Justice officials wrote.
UCLA agreed to a settlement with Jewish plaintiffs
In a related but separate matter, UCLA and the lawyers for the UC system agreed this week to a settlement with several Jewish students who sued UCLA over the encampments last spring.Last year the federal judge in the case agreed with the Jewish plaintiffs who said that the anti-Israel sentiment displayed by protestors in the encampment violated their religious liberties because of their spiritual ties to Israel. “Jewish students were excluded from portions of the UCLA campus because they refused to denounce their faith,” the judge, Mark C. Scarsi, wrote in his preliminary injunctionVarious Jewish groups debate whether anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic. The UCLA encampment included Jewish participants.
In the settlement, UCLA agreed to pay the Jewish plaintiffs $50,000 each, for a total of $200,000. UCLA also agreed to donate more than $2 million to several Jewish organizations. Another $3.6 million is reserved for legal fees and other expenses, the settlement said.UCLA denied any wrongdoing, the settlement stated. A judge must approve the deal.
But that deal was met with outrage by a lawyer representing five pro-Palestinian students and professors, two of whom are Jewish and took part in last year’s encampment. The lawyer, Thomas B. Harvey, filed a legal document in the case to argue that the encampment wasn’t antisemitic and that the settlement itself is flawed. A core theme in his filing is that Zionism is being wrongly conflated with antisemitism.
Harvey is one of several lawyers who sued the UC in March for the injuries pro-Palestinian protesters sustained during the encampment last spring when a mob attacked it.The plaintiffs in the case that UCLA settled this week “never even alleged that members of the Palestine Solidarity Encampment excluded them, let alone because of their religion,” wrote Harvey in an email to CalMatters. “UCLA refused to meaningfully defend its students and faculty against unsupported allegations.”He continued, writing that UC lawyers “conducted no depositions, interviewed no witness and engaged in no discovery. Judge Scarsi even notes this abject failure in his preliminary injunction.”Harvey said UC’s interests “appear to be crushing dissent against genocide in Palestine, currying favor with the Trump administration, and generally capitulating when challenged.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/021822_UCLA_RN_CM_21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-01 01:24:23.721195

Starting this morning, adults aged 21 and over can legally purchase recreational marijuana and marijuana products from licensed cannabis retailers, marking a major milestone in the implementation of Delaware’s cannabis legalization effort.
The initial phase of adult-use cannabis sales is being implemented by a select group of Delaware’s existing medical marijuana compassion centers that have successfully transitioned into the combined medical and adult-use cannabis market. These conversions represent a critical first step in the phased implementation of the state’s comprehensive, regulated cannabis program—designed to prioritize public health, equity, and regulatory compliance.
“Today’s launch of adult-use cannabis sales by Delaware’s existing medical operators is an important milestone in the rollout of the state’s regulated cannabis market,” said Commissioner Joshua Sanderlin. “We’re grateful to all who have worked hard to make this moment possible and remain focused on bringing additional licensees online in the months ahead.”
Under the regulatory framework established by Delaware’s Marijuana Control Act and the Office of the Marijuana Commissioner (OMC), medical marijuana compassion centers that obtained conversion licenses are now authorized to engage in adult-use cannabis sales. Additional licensees—including cultivators, product manufacturers, retail facilities, and testing laboratories—are expected to become operational in the coming months as the state continues its rollout of the adult-use market. New licensees will support both medical patients and adult-use consumers in a combined medical and adult-use cannabis market.
Adult-use sales are possible thanks to landmark legislation passed in 2023, which legalizes cannabis for adults and creates Delaware’s regulatory structure. The legislation prioritizes public health, accountability, and social equity, and after extensive public input, OMC finalized a comprehensive set of regulations published in September 2024.
The conversion license process provided a critical jumpstart to the market by allowing sales to adult-use consumers to begin through Delaware’s existing cannabis retailers, while also generating $4 million in funding for start-up grants supporting social equity licensees. OMC received over 1,200 license applications during the 2024 application period, with 125 licenses awarded through a public lottery in December. OMC continues to issue conditional and active licenses to those lottery winners on a rolling basis, as background checks are completed, and licensees complete all regulatory requirements and pass final inspections.
“The OMC has worked closely with our medical marijuana operators to ensure a smooth transition to the adult-use market,” said Deputy Commissioner Paul Hyland. “Their ability to convert licenses has been instrumental in fast-tracking this launch. As more licensees join in the coming months, we will continue to focus on expanding access responsibly and fostering the growth of a strong and diverse marijuana industry in Delaware.”
Consumers are reminded that only purchases from licensed retailers are legal and regulated under state law. A full list of authorized locations and safety guidelines can be found at www.omc.delaware.gov.

,Florida Phoenix,2025-08-01 04:01:54+00:00,Florida Phoenix,New nursing home regs for patient safety culture surveys are in the works,Christine Sexton,,,,,https://floridaphoenix.com/2025/08/01/new-nursing-home-regs-for-patient-safety-culture-surveys-are-in-the-works/,Florida health care regulators are developing rules to implement a new law that requires nursing homes to anonymously survey their staff about their patient safety culture — a move being heralded by one of the largest watchdog groups in the state. The Agency for Health Care Administration announced Thursday thatit was drawing up the rules […],"AHCA Secretary Shevaun Harris' agency is moving to implement new nursing home laws, including patient safety culture surveys, that Senate President Ben Albritton helped to champion. Florida health care regulators are developing rules to implement a new law that requires nursing homes to anonymously survey their staff about their patient safety culture — a move being heralded by one of the largest watchdog groups in the state.
The Agency for Health Care Administration announced Thursday thatit was drawing up the rules to carry out the new law that was included at the last minute as part of the Legislature’s budget negotiations.
The agency has not released details about the proposed regulation. The notice of rule development is the first step in the process, which can include a public meeting if requested.
AARP Florida State Director Jeff Johnson views it as a “good sign” that AHCA is moving ahead and said AARP will track developments.

“The devil is in the details. Let’s see how the survey is administered. The implementation is really key, and if they’re implemented in such a way that they’re able to actually get what people think is going right and what may not be going right in facilities, then that can be really helpful,” Johnson told the Phoenix.
“And if they’re easily gamed, or if they don’t go into a level of detail as helpful, then it won’t be as helpful. So, there’s still, I think, a real need for us to see what the details of the process looks like and to make sure that it is one that gets the results they want.”
 New regulations and more money

Sen. Colleen Burton filed SB 170 in the 2025 session, a nursing home regulation bill that was a priority for Republican Senate President Ben Albritton. The Senate passed the bill unanimously on April 9. The House, though, never considered the proposal.
AARP supported SB 170 plus additional nursing home bills, including a proposal that would have allowed long term-care facility residents to install electronic recording devices as long as they are willing to foot the bill for installation, removal, and the internet needed to run them. Although endorsed by a House health care subcomittee, the bill ultimately died.
The requirement for the patient safety surveys and administrative fines passed in SB 2514 after legislators agreed to extend the session to pass the state fiscal year 2025-26 budget. The budget guides state spending from July 1 through June 30, 2026 and includes about a $276 million hike in Medicaid payments for nursing homes.
Patient safety culture refers to the values, beliefs, and norms that are shared by health care practitioners and other staff throughout the organization that influence their actions and behaviors to support and promote patient safety, according to a legislative staff analysis of the bill. Patient safety culture can be measured by staff surveys  that assess the values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors related to patient safety that are rewarded, supported, expected, and accepted in an organization.
The new law requires long-term care facilities to conduct patient safety and culture surveys biennially. The surveys must be conducted anonymously “to encourage  completion of the survey by staff working in or employed by the facility.” The nursing home industry is required to submit the findings to AHCA and must include in those data the survey participation rate.
Also, the new law authorizes the state to levy a $10,000 administrative fine per violation against nursing homes or headquarters of nursing homes that don’t submit their financial data to AHCA’s financial reporting system. Legislators in 2021 required the nursing homes to start submit finances to the state so legislators can gain a better understanding of the billions spent on nursing home care. 
They tweaked the law later to require that the facilities to provide audited financial data that must include the fiscal year-end balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flow, and statement of retained earnings.
In addition to pushing ahead on the rule for the patient safety culture surveys, AHCA announced Thursday that it’s developing a rule allowing the state to assess the fines.
Johnson said the tandem of changes should help the state gain a better understanding of what’s going on at Florida nursing homes.
“I will say this, given the amount of money that we do commit as a state to nursing homes and the fact that it seems to be increasing rather than shifting into home- and community-based alternatives, it is critically important that we as taxpayers know that we’re getting good value for the money, the tax money, that we’re committing to it,” Johnson said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 04:01:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Grant discontinuation threatens CT student well-being,Ari Shukla,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/grant-discontinuation-threatens-ct-student-well-being/,The Trump Administration’s recent discontinuation of federal grants for improving mental health services for students is appalling.,"The health and safety of Connecticut students must always be a top priority of our state and our legislature. Youth comprise the future of our state and our country as a whole, and it is essential to consider the protection of student well-being with the utmost importance.
Preserving student mental health is critical to the welfare of our state as a whole, as well as being indispensable at a personal level to individuals and communities. Worsened student mental health directly contributes to devastating acts of school violence, including school shootings, or student suicide.
Today, particularly given the constant pressure imposed on students in the digital age by social media, access to mental health support is a significant and vital means of protecting the future of our children, our friends and families, and the future of our state.
The Trump Administration’s recent discontinuation of several federal grants originally distributed as a part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) with the intention of improving mental health services for students is appalling by nature, and casts serious concern over whether the priorities of the U.S. government are truly aligned to the best interests of the people.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has recently signed onto a coalition of 16 state attorneys general to file a lawsuit with the intention of restoring federal grant funds retracted by the Trump Administration to the schools which were originally intended to receive them. BSCA was passed into law under the Biden Administration to allocate funds for the support and promotion of mental health and safety programs in schools, as well as increasing federal regulation surrounding firearm distribution to prevent gun violence.
As a part of the grant allocation under BSCA, the Graduate School of Work at the University of Connecticut received a five-year grant of roughly $3.01 million to support 25 social work students in providing mental health services to the Waterbury, Vernon, Hartford, and New Britain school districts, supporting intra-district diversification of social workers as well as the overall augmentation of student mental health and well-being.
The actions of the Trump Administration are poorly justified, with the lawsuit itself citing the reasoning behind the revocation of certain federal grants to be “arbitrary and capricious.” The reclamation of the federal grant money was claimed by the attorneys general to be both unconstitutional and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. From a legal standpoint, the Trump Administration has behaved in a way unbefitting of a governing body.
Retracting the federal funds will only bring harm to students in need of support, and may potentiate violence in schools that results in mental and physical harm to student health and safety. Especially in rural or low-income districts, BSCA was a critical means of protecting student welfare and augmenting the quality of mental health services. Unfortunately, many communal mental health programs are already under strain, and thus students depend on school programs for support. Under BSCA, suicide risk lessened by almost half, and problematic behaviors such as absenteeism significantly decreased.
A letter from Dr. Murray Bessette of the Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development in the U.S. Department of Education attempts to justify the discontinuation of the grants by stating that they “violate the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; undermine the well-being of the students these programs are intended to help; or constitute an inappropriate use of federal funds.”
However, no court has yet ruled that the BSCA grants violate Federal Civil Rights Law. With respect to the reported decrease in problematic student behaviors under BSCA discussed in the previous paragraph, the BSCA grants clearly and effectively promoted the mental and physical well-being of students, tangibly improving educational merit and potential for excellence, which, according to Bessette, is a priority of the Department of Education.
The Biden Administration undertook the rigorous process to pass BSCA into law due to its clear potential to prevent gun violence and establish safe and supportive learning environments conducive to student mental well-being. It is genuinely perturbing that one of the major justifications used to support the reclamation of these grants is that they are not well-aligned with the Trump Administration’s priorities.
Now, with the discontinuation of key BSCA grants, graduate students such as those at UConn’s Graduate School of Social Work will lose critical financial support, potentially resulting in their being unable to continue their studies. School districts may be forced to fire social workers and mental health professionals hired in response to these grants, leaving students susceptible to mental health problems unable to receive help they need.
The Trump Administration is not only actively reversing the clear progress that BSCA was making to protect student mental health, but also leaving social workers and students without funding to support their jobs or their studies. These are real people, members of our community, whose welfare is diminishing in response to the arguably immoral and, depending on the outcome of the lawsuit filed by the attorneys general, veritably unconstitutional acts of the Trump Administration.
The people of Connecticut must give their full support to the opposition to the discontinuation of these grants. We must show support for legislators and interest groups that oppose the actions of the Trump Administration, whether that means monetary donation to support student mental health providers or public expression of disapproval regarding the Trump Administration’s grant discontinuations.
Now, today, Connecticut as a state must stand together to protect the mental well-being of our youth. This is a matter of politics, yes, but even more this is a matter of compassion, of empathy. These are our students, in our state, and we must do whatever is necessary to promote the well-being of our future generations.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Kayaks won’t bring relief –or peace– to Gaza,Mark Fishman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/mark/,Israel cannot end Islamic extremist terrorism on its own. Kayaking on Long Island Sound isn’t the solution.,"The World Central Kitchen was among the first groups on the ground after Hamas and its Palestinian supporters invaded Israel and slaughtered 1,200 Israeli and foreign civilians on October 7, 2023.
WCK remained in Israel throughout 19 months of war, feeding tens of thousands of Israelis whose homes had been torched or who were displaced by rocket, drone, and ballistic missile attacks by Iranian proxies from the north, south and east.
Last year, after Israel’s military made a grave targeting mistake and struck a WCK aid caravan, Israelis and Jews from around the world donated to the aid organization in a collective show of grief and solidarity. It was a tragic day, one that deeply shook Israel and the diaspora.
Recently, in part to raise money for this organization, a small group of Connecticut residents kayaked to the park at Lighthouse Point in New Haven, ate watermelon together, and posed for pictures while holding a hand-lettered sign: “FEED GAZA.” They called reporters in advance, hoping someone would obtain footage of them paddling in “solidarity” with the Gaza flotillas -–small ships carrying negligible amounts of aid whose organizers self-righteously proclaim their intention to sail to Gaza from the safety of a friendly port. Predictably and as they hoped, the Israeli navy stopped them long before they’re taken hostage by the jihadi groups operating in the territory and, as in the case of Greta Thunberg, even feeds them.
The July 28 op-ed that followed the kayaking trip – “Palestinians are human”– with all respect to the excellent CT Mirror, is not helpful. While I, like most, totally agree with the title that Palestinians are human (although Hamas seems not to agree when using Palestinian civilians as their human shields), the author, in essence, was issuing a press release with admissions that the purpose of the kayaking was to gain media attention for this “unique action.”
Recently appearing in various publications have been heart-wrenching photos of children possibly suffering from malnutrition. Even the status of those children often poses a question, as Hamas is circulating pictures of children with terrible genetic conditions and calling those children victims of war.
As real as the humanitarian crisis is, there has been considerable disagreement and demagoguery about the causes, affecting the statements and actions of governments and skewing their actions and words, often against Israel, as has become fashionable of late. The difficulty of determining the true state of affairs, even in Israel, is the subject of an insightful essay by distinguished Canadian-American-Israeli journalist Matti Friedman.
Enough finger pointing for now about the New Haven “flotilla.” The fact there is a real humanitarian crisis happening-– the reason that the U.S. has funded tens of millions in aid for Gaza and spent thousands of diplomatic hours trying to resolve the war. Negotiations that Hamas has walked away from on multiple occasions, including last week, is why Israel has again added humanitarian aid distribution pauses into each day, created safe corridors and participated in air drop operations. It’s also why the Israeli military is irate that there are more than 900 containers of aid sitting in Gaza waiting for distribution. Instead of working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the U.N. — never a helpful force in the Middle East when needed —  has picked up its toys and left, only returning when Israel released photos of the containers sitting uselessly in the yard.
War is bad. That’s why we try so hard to avoid it. But when barbarians like Hamas come crashing into your country to rape, torture, and kill, a government must respond to protect its people. Israel ended the last ceasefire because Hamas was making zero progress toward releasing the hostages. Hamas will lose this war. The only question is how many Palestinians and Israeli soldiers will it take with it. Sadly, Hamas has no decency or shame.
We can all agree that Palestinians deserve to live in thriving communities with economic stability, with 21st century educational systems, and within the reach of diverse, global markets. They must stand up to terrorism and refuse to surrender their children to ‘martyrdom’ and violence. Recognizing a Palestinian state is irrelevant; Palestinians themselves rejected two-state solutions multiple times because it would mean recognizing Israel as a Jewish state. They want a “Palestine,” but they still long to eradicate Jews from Israel.
Instead of a pretend flotilla, maybe consider contributing to any of the Israeli villages trying to rebuild after the horrific attacks perpetrated by Gazans. Those agricultural communities, prior to being raided by terrorists, contributed mightily to the Gazan economy and tried to serve as peace bridges between Israelis and Palestinians.
Israel cannot end Islamic extremist terrorism on its own. Kayaking on Long Island Sound isn’t the solution. Call on Hamas to surrender, call on Palestinians to forge peace, and get the hostages home.

Others were hopeful that reopening the reactor could bring much-needed jobs and stimulate the local economy.","Constellation Energy plans to restart Unit 1 of the former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant as the Crane Clean Energy Center. (Capital-Star/Peter Hall)On Thursday, community members had the chance to voice their hopes and concerns about the planned reopening of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. 
More than 100 people attended a public meeting held by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) at the Penn State Harrisburg campus near Middletown, less than five miles from the now-decommissioned reactor.
“Tonight, the reason we’re here is transparency and communication with the public,” said Jamie Pelton, acting director of the Division of Operating Reactor Licensing.
With increased energy demands, due largely to a construction boom of power-hungry data centers driven by advances in artificial intelligence, Constellation Energy is working to reopen the nuclear facility — renamed Crane Clean Energy Center — by 2027. That’s a year earlier than initially expected.
It is slated to power data centers for Microsoft. An agreement reached between the tech company and Constellation is reported to last 20 years, could create around 3,400 jobs and bring $3 billion in state and federal taxes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It will also be one of the first shuttered nuclear plants in the United States to reopen, along with another plant in Palisades, Michigan.
Attendees offered polarized views, with some concerned about the potential of another failure like the one in 1979, or the impacts on the environment and public health. Others were hopeful that reopening the reactor could bring much-needed jobs and stimulate the economy in Londonderry Township and surrounding communities in Dauphin County. Each person was allowed around two minutes to speak.
One of Three Mile Island’s two reactors partially melted down in 1979. That accident captivated the country and changed the course of the nuclear energy industry in the United States. No injuries or deaths were reported to have resulted from the accident. But some attendees at the meeting recalled what is why like during the crisis.
“I had a metallic taste in my mouth, and so did so many other people,” said Maria Frisby, 61, who lives in Middletown. “How are you going to prevent all of that from occurring again?”

The site’s other reactor continued operating until 2019 when it was shut down by Constellation Energy, the site’s owner, which deemed it more expensive to operate than it was worth. 
Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, said in a statement to the Capital-Star that the reactor that operated until 2019 “was one of the highest performing and safest nuclear reactors in the country until we had to prematurely retire the unit in 2019 due to market conditions.”
“Microsoft is enabling us to make the investment to restart the unit as the Crane Clean Energy Center, bringing back over 600 jobs and putting over 800 megawatts of clean, emissions free power back onto the grid where it will go into the homes, businesses, schools and hospitals throughout the region,” he added.
But despite the site’s history, many people supported its reopening.
“I stand before you in support of a responsible restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center,” said Jim Enders, president of the Central Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council. “We’ve safely built and continue to maintain other nuclear facilities throughout the east coast and the Midwest, and we’re ready, willing and able to bring Crane back online in a safe manner. It’s time to turn the page.”
Others welcomed the impact new jobs and workers could have on the community.
“Middletown’s historic downtown is just minutes from the plant, and it has numerous small businesses that thrived over many years from the customers from the island,” said Ellen Willenbecher, vice president of the Middletown Borough council. “For some families who had to leave Middletown when the Island closed, they’re moving home. Local businesses will welcome back old and new customers.”
But the plan had detractors as well.

Patricia Longenecker, who lives near the plant, raised concerns about the project’s environmental impact, and what it would mean to operate a reactor dependent on the Susquehanna River in an era of increased doubt and flood risk due to climate change. 
“My comments come from being a steward of Lancaster County farmland, with my family going back 200 years,” she said. “Last October, our area experienced a severe drought. One could walk across the river south of Three Mile Island on rocks. Where would 100 million gallons of water per day needed to operate the plant have been secured?”
The Capital-Star could not verify the amount of water required to operate the plant.
Maureen Mulligan, who lives in Lebanon, was particularly concerned about how the NRC, or any other group, could ensure safety amid President Donald Trump’s push to slash the federal workforce and deregulate the energy industry.
“There is a lot of pressure on the NRC to race to permit nuclear plants to enable these humungous, energy hogging AI plants to get built,” she said. “Our community, which has experienced the worst [nuclear] accident in U.S. history, deserves to be protected, and the NRC will have to earn our confidence back.”
In June, the Trump administration fired one of the five NRC commissioners. The move followed an executive order calling for “reform” of the independent commission, a “wholesale revision of its regulations,” and for the body to facilitate the expansion of the nation’s nuclear capacity.
Larry Arnold, 76, who also remembers the 1979 accident, put it more bluntly.

“What happens when the current administration decides it doesn’t like what the NRC is doing, and cuts staff and budget?” he said. “What will you be doing then and how will we be protected?”
Arnold also raised concerns about evacuation plans, which will be created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which has recently had its funding slashed.
“We did not have a realistic evacuation plan on March 28, 1979,” he said. 
Other speakers raised concerns specifically about the feasibility of evacuating nearby hospitals and senior centers.  
The NRC panelists said another virtual public meeting will be held on August 6 at 4:00 p.m. Information can be found on their public meeting schedule.

(Nigell Moses/Verite)NEW ORLEANS – The mother of a child sex trafficking survivor who has pressed authorities for years to bring her alleged pimp to justice learned from a reporter Thursday that he was mistakenly released from jail and was out for months before authorities were aware.
David A. Jones, 32, was released from the Orleans Justice Center in December after a mixup involving his bond paperwork, The Times-Picayune first reported. A judge had ordered Jones held without bond in May 2024 after he violated conditions of his release for an arrest separate from his charges for child sex trafficking and kidnapping in 2018.  
The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which operates the city jail, did not disclose Jones’ release to the public until April, when Jones turned himself in, and said he was on an ankle monitor through the entire four-month period.  
District Attorney Jason Williams also didn’t share information with the survivor’s mother about Jones’ release, she said. The woman’s name is being withheld to protect the identity of her daughter, who was 13 when Jones allegedly sold her for sex with other men.
“I did not find out until a few hours ago,” she said in an interview Thursday afternoon. “I had no knowledge of this at all, and I’ve been in contact with the (victim) advocate over at the DAs office. No one notified me of this incident at all.”
In a text message sent to our news partners at WVUE-TV Fox 8 News, the district attorney’s office said it became aware of Jones’ release when he walked into court March 27. The judge was informed he should not have been released, and the prosecution asked the court for an arrest warrant April 4. Jones’ attorney emailed the DA’s office April 8 to say he would turn himself in, which he did April 14 according to the DA’s statement. 
Sheriff’s office: No mistakes made
The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office disputes that it made a mistake with Jones’ release. It provided a recap of Jones’ recent court dates to Fox 8 News that said a prosecutor was present for the April 8 court date when the record noted Jones was out on bond and on an ankle monitor. Jones appeared before a judge six days later and was returned to jail 134 days after his release. 
“What occurred was part of an internal cleanup of administrative records. Specifically, the closure of one of Mr. Jones’ other case folders,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. “This action was taken for record-keeping clarity and did not cause a change in his physical custody or legal status.”
The sheriff’s office said “any suggestion that Mr. Jones was mistakenly released, including those made by the Office of the Orleans Parish District Attorney, is factually incorrect.”

However, Jones’ attorney, William Boggs, told The Times-Picayune his client’s release was an “error” and that ““he shouldn’t have been allowed to bond out.”
Following another mistaken release last week, the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office fired two of its deputies and suspended five others Thursday. Khalil Bryan was let out of jail July 25 after guards failed to follow identification protocol and confused Bryan with another incarcerated person with the same last name. He remains at large.
Sheriff Susan Hutson, who’s seeking re-election, has been under intense scrutiny since 10 inmates organized and executed a mass escape in May. Six of the escapees face murder or attempted murders charges. One man, convicted killer Derrick Groves, 28, has yet to be caught.
An investigation into the May 16 breakout has led to 16 arrests, including charges against two jail employees accused of aiding the escapees.
Case approaching 7 years
Jones’ arrest affidavit details how the victim’s mother learned in August 2018 her daughter was being exploited for sex. She received a phone call from an unknown woman who informed her streaming live video posted on Twitter showed her 13-year-old “engaging in sexual intercourse with several men.” 
The affidavit said Jones allegedly kept the girl in a downtown New Orleans hotel room for several days and she was forced to have sex for paying clients. He reportedly would attack the girl when she disclosed her actual age to the men, having instructed her to say she was 18 years old.  
Jones was indicted in November 2018 and formally charged a month later. His case would stretch out for months through a series of continuances and rescheduled hearings. The public defender assigned to his case was changed three times in 16 months before Jones was released on $75,000 bond in October 2020.
He was arrested again in May 2024 for domestic abuse, and his bond was revoked, court records show. Back in jail, Jones was charged a month later when was allegedly found with a 7-inch shank. 
It was for that contraband charge that Jones was allowed to post bond in December and released. His trial is set to begin Aug. 18.     
Over the years of seeking justice, the survivor’s mother has become active in statewide efforts to prevent sex trafficking. She told reporters she now feels officials at every level have disappointed her.
“This case has been pushed back time after time after time,” she said. “This happened when my child was 13 years old; she will now be 21. So how do you make sense of something like that? You don’t. You just don’t.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature is scheduled to meet Saturday for a special session called by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, but lawmakers are expecting to eschew the governor’s agenda in favor of votes to either override or sustain some of his vetoes from earlier this year.
The special session could last for 30 days, but legislators believe they won’t need that much time to act.
“I believe it’ll be short,” Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said during a July 25 legislative meeting. “We go in Aug. 2, and we leave.”
In an opinion column, Stevens and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said they see the most pressing issues in the special session to be overriding two of the governor’s vetoes — one of about $50 million in public education funding, and another of Senate Bill 183, which that would compel the Alaska Department of Revenue to produce specific reports about tax settlements paid by oil companies to the state.
Several legislators said they think additional vetoes could be taken up as well, but that would be decided only when all lawmakers are in Juneau.
“From my understanding, we’re going to do a ‘temperature check’ after considering an override on the education funding appropriations and SB 183,” said Rep. Robyn Burke, D-Utqiagvik.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, said that “if there’s success on those things, and there’s a desire to go forward, maybe it changes, but at this point, it’s those two things.”
Dunleavy has asked legislators to consider education policy issues and the proposed creation of and an Alaska Department of Agriculture. 
Legislators rejected the governor’s proposals this spring.
“The governor, I think, is asking for that to be rethought,” Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, told the Kenai and Soldotna chambers of commerce this week.
Legislators are preparing to turn down the governor’s request for reconsideration but are advancing alternatives. They have created an education task force to discuss some of the policy changes the governor has proposed. That task force, formally dubbed the Task Force on Education Funding, will hold its first meeting Aug. 25 in Anchorage.
“Yes, the name implies funding, but they will be taking up open enrollment and there are all sorts of policy things that will be on the agenda,” said Mike Mason, chief of staff to Sen. Loki Tobin, D-Anchorage, one of the co-chairs of the task force.
In a written statement, Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, said lawmakers will consider creating a Department of Agriculture, but via legislation during the 2026 regular session, not during the special session.
Lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 128 to expand the governor’s original proposal, which had been enshrined in an executive order. Lawmakers voted to prevent that order from coming into effect, citing gaps in the governor’s proposal.
“During the last legislative session, we listened to the public and incorporated their feedback into a stronger, more comprehensive bill,” instead of an executive order that could not be adapted to fit the real needs of Alaska’s agriculture industry,” Giessel said in the statement.
She is chair of the Senate Resources Committee, which held three hearings on the bill earlier this year.
Shortly after announcing the special session, Dunleavy asked conservative Republican legislators to stay away from its first five days. That’s when the Alaska Constitution requires lawmakers to vote on vetoes. An absent lawmaker is the same as a “no” vote. 
In a constituent newsletter, Giessel said she opposes the governor’s request.
“When we (legislators) campaigned to convince you to hire us for this job, we made all kinds of promises,” she wrote. “Voters decided to trust that we would do the job of showing up for work. It’s disturbing that the Governor asked the Republicans to break trust with Alaskan voters. (Perhaps we could construe that he doesn’t value trust and integrity, based on his action in making that request of Republicans.)”
Public polling results published Thursday by Data for Progress show Alaskans overwhelmingly favor an education veto override, with 91% of Democrats and 65% of independents and third-party voters in favor of an override. Only 35% of Republicans said they support an override. The polling firm works with progressive organizations.
Initially, several Republican legislators said they would follow the governor’s request. 
However, on Monday Dunleavy called on legislators to hold committee meetings starting on Sunday. And on Wednesday, some — including Reps. Jamie Allard, Cathy Tilton, Kevin McCabe and Rebecca Schwanke — said they had reconsidered their plans and will attend in order to vote against overrides.
Budget vetoes are sustained unless at least 45 of 60 state lawmakers vote for an override. Policy vetoes are sustained unless at least 40 lawmakers vote to override.
Initially, Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, was expected to be absent from the special session because of military service. Last week, he was able to obtain special leave and is now expected to be in Juneau on Saturday.
That matters because 46 of 60 lawmakers voted in May to override a prior Dunleavy education veto. If Dunbar was absent, only 45 of those lawmakers would have been present, at most. A change by any one of those pro-override legislators would sustain the governor’s decision.
Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and a member of the House majority, said he’s not certain what will ultimately be on the agenda for Saturday’s joint session. That will be determined in talks between the leaders of the House and Senate, he said, possibly as late as Saturday morning.
Wielechowski and House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, said that’s their understanding of the plan, too.
A bill sponsored by Schrage, HB 70, was one of five policy measures vetoed by the governor between the end of the regular session and the start of this special session, meaning that if lawmakers don’t override the veto now, it will be sustained.
That bill would allow ambulance crews to help police and rescue dogs in the event of an injury. 
Burke, too, has a vetoed bill — House Bill 174, dealing with teacher housing and the state-operated Mount Edgecumbe boarding school.
“I’m hopeful that we’ll consider an override of HB 174,” she wrote by text message from Kivalina. 
“HB 174 passed with a total of 54 yeas, 5 nays and 1 excused,” she wrote. “There are two other bills that were vetoed that received 50+ yeas out of both bodies; I hope we’ll have an opportunity to consider those bills, too.”
There’s also the possibility that lawmakers could bring up other budget vetoes, too. Dunleavy vetoed a significant chunk of the major maintenance budget for public schools and a substantial number of road construction projects. The latter vetoes were because the governor disagreed with the funding mechanism used by the Legislature.
In a hearing of the House Transportation Committee last week, legislators said hundreds of millions of dollars in projects were endangered by the governor’s veto.
The governor’s legislative liaison, Jordan Shilling, commented on Facebook that lawmakers were to blame for writing a faulty method for funding those projects.
By text message from Kivalina, Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks and chair of the transportation committee, said that while overriding the transportation funding veto is “a priority issue for me and for many communities across the state … my focus this special session is on education funding, as this is the No. 1 issue my constituents and Alaskans have contacted me about.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz said there will likely be a special session this fall that could address the Great Salt Lake, which has recently fallen to dangerously low levels. 



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


Schultz told the Great Salt Lake Collaborative on Thursday he’s asking the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands to reexamine how the berm that divides the north and south arms of the lake is managed — depending on what they find, Schultz said he might petition the governor to include Great Salt Lake legislation during a special session that will likely come in the fall. 
“We think that could add some additional tools to the toolbox to help the ecosystem on the south arm,” said Schultz, R-Hooper. 
The Great Salt Lake is currently at 4,192 feet in elevation, with the north arm at roughly 4,191.5 feet. That’s “scary low,” Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed said earlier this week, nearing levels not seen since the lake hit a historic low of 4,188.5 feet in fall 2022. 
The berm that delineates the Great Salt Lake’s north and south arms is used to manage salinity, a critical measure of ecosystem health. The south arm is where the majority of fresh water flows to the lake, from the Bear, Weber and Jordan rivers — therefore, lake levels in the south arm are typically higher. 
Now, the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands, which manages much of the lake’s ecosystem, is going to see if it’s possible to raise the berm to 4,192 feet. That would cut off the north arm from fresh water inflows, increase levels on the south arm, and boost the south arm’s ecosystem. 
Schultz said the north arm would not be permanently cut off, and that the state does not intend to kill one part of the lake to save another. 
“At some point in time, that berm would get opened back up and the lake would be equalized so that we are not killing the north arm of the lake. That is not an option for us,” he said Thursday. 
Great Salt Lake slipping back into ‘scary low’ water levels

Currently, state code directs the division to close the berm if levels drop to 4,190 feet, a process that involves heavy machinery dumping boulders in the lake to form a closed causeway. Since the lake has not yet dropped that low, the berm is washed out and ineffective. If the division finds it feasible to raise the threshold to 4,192 feet, they would then close the berm. However, changing that threshold would require legislative approval, hence the special session. 
Jamie Barnes, director of the Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands, said the legislature could also amend state code so that changes to how the division manages the berm wouldn’t require a special session. 
“Right now, we’re considering all options — what does it do for the ecosystem, what does it do for salinity, what does it do for the overall, whole area of the lake,” Barnes said. 
As the lake shrinks, the lakebed is exposed, which contributes to poor air quality as storms whip up toxic, heavy metal-laden dust that blankets the Wasatch Front. That can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. 
Declining levels can also expose microbialites, organic deposits that are a crucial part of the lake’s ecosystem. Microbialites are essential for brine fly populations, the main food source for millions of migratory birds that stop on the lake. If the microbialites are exposed for long periods of time, it can prompt a chain reaction ultimately impacting the entire ecosystem. 
Less water in the lake also leads to an increase in salinity levels, which can harm the brine shrimp population — that can also have devastating impacts on the ecosystem, while hurting the million-dollar brine shrimp fishing industry.

,California,2025-08-01 00:04:11+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom wants voters to weigh in on new congressional districts in November,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/california-redistricting-november-ballot/,Gov. Gavin Newsom says he’ll ask voters to decide on new districts in November as California seeks to challenge GOP-controlled states redrawing maps to favor Republicans.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom says he’ll ask voters to decide on new districts in November as California seeks to challenge GOP-controlled states redrawing maps to favor Republicans. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom is eyeing a special election in the first week of November to ask California voters to sign off on revised U.S. House districts that could boost Democratic prospects in the 2026 midterms.
Though no new seats have been proposed yet, Newsom said Thursday that he is working with the Legislature and congressional representatives on a plan that would temporarily set aside California’s independent redistricting commission and bring an alternative map directly to the public for approval.
“We will go to the people of this state in a transparent way and ask them to consider the new circumstances, to consider these new realities,” Newsom told reporters during a visit to a Sacramento County airfield, where he showed off new state firefighting equipment.
“This is not going to be done in a back room. This is not going to be done by members of some private group or body,” he added. “It’s going to be given to the voters for their consideration in a very transparent way so they know exactly what they’re doing and they can go back in 2030 to original form with our independent redistricting intact.”
It was the most detail the governor has publicly provided so far about how he plans to respond to a burgeoning partisan redistricting war set off by President Donald Trump in recent months.
States last redrew their congressional seats after the 2020 census, to ensure the districts are roughly equal in population, and were not expected to revisit the process for another decade.
But Republican leaders are under growing pressure from Trump to help shore up a narrow GOP majority in Congress ahead of a potentially challenging midterm election. Texas lawmakers are currently rushing to adopt a new congressional map eliminating five Democratic seats, which has sparked similar efforts in other Republican-controlled states and hand-wringing from Democrats about how to counteract it.
Newsom: California must step in
Newsom asserted again Thursday that California must pause independent redistricting, which he has previously supported, to fight a president that “wants to rig the game” against Democrats, who could potentially block Trump’s agenda if they win control of the House in 2026.
“De facto the Trump presidency ends in November of next year if the American people are given a fair chance and a voice and a choice,” Newsom said.
While most other states give redistricting authority to their legislatures, California uses a bipartisan citizen commission created by voters through a ballot measure. So to usurp the commission and implement more Democratic-leaning districts, Newsom must call a statewide special election and go back to the voters.
Democrats currently hold 43 of the state’s 52 House seats, including several competitive districts that flipped from Republican control last November. 
The governor said he wants to hold the election on the first Tuesday in November because many communities already have local elections scheduled then. That could make it easier to mount on short notice and help reduce an estimated price tag of more than $200 million — though Newsom also said “there’s too much at stake” to worry about the cost.
“How much did it cost to have the theatrics with the National Guard and Trump?” he said, referring to the president’s recent deployment of thousands of troops in Los Angeles to quell immigration-related protests. “How many hundreds of millions of dollars was wasted?”
The November target gives California an extremely tight window to act. State law requires county elections offices to send a mail ballot to every registered voter a month before election day; military and overseas voter ballots and voter information guides go out 15 days before that. The material would need to be ready by late September to meet those deadlines.
Meanwhile, the Legislature is on summer recess until Aug. 18. The Democratic caucuses of the state Senate and Assembly are expected to begin private discussions next week about advancing a ballot measure, which requires a two-thirds majority in both houses, so that they could potentially pass it before the end of August.
Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Healdsburg Democrat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, said the Assembly will review its options to counteract Trump’s redistricting scheme and “ensure our government remains fair, transparent and representative of the people.” 
“This move is an attempt to silence voters who reject MAGA extremism — including here in California, where the people have spoken loud and clear in two national elections,” Rivas said in a statement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/020623-US-Capitol-DC-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C691&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-31 20:56:17.629472

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party is singing a different tune about nonpartisan labor leader Dan Osborn this time around, compared to Osborn’s 2024 bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer. 
Wednesday on X, Nebraska Democratic Chair Jane Kleeb posted, “We are supporting Dan Osborn” against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterms. She wrote it in response to a question from an X user about whether the party expects a Democratic candidate to join the race.
  U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., speaks to supporters during his campaign kickoff event Aug. 23, 2023, in Omaha. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)
“We believe a coalition of Dems, Indys, and Republicans can beat Ricketts and break up the one-party rule,” Kleeb replied. “We like the odds of a mechanic vs a billionaire.” 
The state’s second-largest political party had hinted in an early July response to a question from the Examiner that leaders were not actively recruiting a candidate for the race. Kleeb’s online support carries weight partly because, in addition to her state role, she is essentially chair of state party chairs for the national Democrats, serving as president of the Association of State Democratic Committees.
On Thursday, state Democratic spokesperson José Flores, Jr. said the party doesn’t endorse candidates and repeated that the party is not actively pursuing a candidate, though a Democrat could still join the race.
“Our goal will be to defeat Ricketts with a coalition,” Flores said. 
The Ricketts campaign and Nebraska Republicans quickly used Kleeb’s tweet as its latest attempt to paint Osborn as a “Democrat.” 
Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson, said, “Fake Dan Osborn can continue pretending to be an independent, but he is endorsed by the Nebraska Democratic Party, funded by Democrats” and backs the party’s positions, which he called extreme.

State voting records show Osborn has been a registered nonpartisan since at least 2004. Osborn has said that he maintains his independence from the Democratic Party and, if elected, won’t caucus with either party. He is known for helping lead the Kellogg’s strike in 2021.
Osborn told the Examiner on Thursday that he is running to “fix a broken Washington” and that voters from all different types of political leanings believe in what he’s doing and want to help.
“Pete Ricketts has failed every single Nebraskan, and every single Nebraskan is welcome to join our campaign,” Osborn said.
Osborn is campaigning this time against a former two-term governor with Nebraska’s dominant political operation, but the labor leader has populism on his side. His bid comes as both political parties are increasingly unpopular, and some voters are losing faith in institutions and seeking alternatives. 
The Ricketts campaign has relentlessly criticized Osborn for weeks, pointing out that he uses ActBlue, a fundraising tool often used by Democrats. Some other nonpartisan and Independent candidates in different states avoided using ActBlue to keep from being associated with the Democratic Party.

Nebraska Republican Party chair Mary Jane Truemper piled on Thursday with a tweet, writing “Nothing says ‘Independent’ like a full endorsement from the Chair of the Nebraska Democrat Party.” 
Osborn in 2024 flirted with seeking Democratic and third-party support until it was too late for the Democrats to run a candidate of their own, which led to some grumbling by some of his potential supporters on the left. 
Fischer, during that race, labeled Osborn a Democrat in sheep’s clothing, but largely ignored him until after he had built a populist brand. 
Toward the end of the race, Fischer and Nebraska Republicans alleged that many of the millions that poured into Osborn’s 2024 campaign had come from Democrats and Democratic-leaning donors. They often highlighted that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee gave him money once national leaders saw his momentum. 
“I didn’t ask for that money,” Osborn told the Examiner earlier this month. “This time around, I’m not going to ask for it again.”

Chairman J. Garrett Renville’s tribe hosted the meeting at its headquarters in Agency Village. Earlier in the day, he helped guide some members on a tour of the tribe’s 25-bed, under-construction jail, and joined them for a lengthy visit with the tribe’s historian in a room filled with artifacts, many of which had been repatriated back to the tribe from museums.
Republican South Dakota lawmaker removes ‘white boy summer’ social media post after criticism

Renville’s comments during the afternoon meeting came in response to a now-deleted July 4 social media post from Rep. Logan Manhart, R-Aberdeen, that read “it’s white boy summer and the boys are back in charge #MAGA.” 
Manhart’s district, District 1, includes parts of the Lake Traverse Reservation, home to the Sisseton-Wahpeton tribe. 
The post drew criticism from state Democrats, who said the phrase “white boy summer” is used by white supremacist organizations. The post also drew criticism from some members of Manhart’s own party, though House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach rejected calls by Democrats to “address” the issue with “the seriousness it demands.”
Odenbach is a member of the State-Tribal Relations Committee, but attended Thursday’s meeting virtually.
A copy of a South Dakota Searchlight article on Manhart’s post, reprinted in the Mitchell Republic, was pinned to a bulletin board outside the tribe’s education office on Thursday. A reference to his status as a lawmaker with Lake Traverse constituents was underlined in black pen. 
Remarks from Renville
Renville welcomed the lawmakers at the start of the meeting and thanked them for offering a forum for discussions on relations between the state and its sovereign tribal nations. After the meeting, he handed the members a blanket as a gift from the tribe.
“This committee represents one of the few formal venues in South Dakota where tribal voices are not only heard, but are central to the discussion,” Renville said.
Before ending his opening remarks, however, he said he wanted to address comments that “do not reflect the diversity or the values of District 1.” It was a reference to Manhart’s Instagram post.
“I typically don’t lend weight to inflammatory or racially charged remarks. Often, I know they are intended to distract or appeal to the lowest instincts in politics, and history has taught us that those strategies rarely produce progress,” Renville said, reading from prepared remarks. “It certainly doesn’t reflect the kind of leadership that we needed here.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)
Renville then thanked Sen. Mike Rohl, R-Aberdeen, who represents part of the reservation and sits on the committee, for “his willingness to communicate and stay engaged” in spite of disagreements on policy.
“Despite these disappointments and comments made by one of the district reps, I still believe in the promise of public service,” Renville said. “I believe there’s always hope, hope that other leaders, such as yourselves, will continue to lead by example.”
Response from lawmakers
The committee’s chairman, Pierre Republican Rep. Will Mortenson, told Renville the committee “shares your sentiments to a large extent.”
“I want to assure you that those are not reflective or commonplace with this Legislature,” said Mortenson, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. “This committee doesn’t associate ourselves with it.”
Manhart did not respond to a message seeking comment on Thursday. 
Odenbach, who wrote an email in July to his colleagues in response to Democrats’ criticisms of Manhart, did not speak during the Thursday committee meeting. Odenbach’s July email said it’s not for him to divine the underlying meaning of legislators’ social media posts, and rejected what he described as Democrats’ “insinuation that South Dakota is a state founded by racist oppressors, or that our great citizens of today are the cause” of continued harm to Native Americans and other marginalized groups.
The majority leader did not respond to a message seeking comment on Renville’s remarks.

But once they do that, longer-term impacts of the federal law — including Medicaid work requirements and food assistance cost burden shifts — will still loom large, health experts and economists warned top state Democrats on Thursday. 
The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing estimates that those federal changes, some of which won’t take effect until 2027, will put 377,000 Coloradans at risk of Medicaid disenrollment and add significant administrative costs to the state.
The law, which was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, cuts more than $1 trillion nationwide from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes.
All four Republican members of the Colorado delegation to the U.S. House voted in favor of the law. All four Democrats, as well as Colorado’s two Democratic U.S. senators, voted against it.

The law’s reduction in health care premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act insurance enrollees will mean premium increases of 50% to 150% or more for nearly 300,000 Coloradans, said Adam Fox, the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative’s deputy director.
“The reconciliation law is dramatically and rapidly diminishing affordability of health insurance,” Fox said during a presentation to the state House and Senate Democratic caucuses at the Capitol in Denver. The tax and spending law was passed in Congress through a reconciliation process.
The presentation came a day after members of the Executive Committee of the Legislative Council met at the Capitol to discuss the estimated $1.2 billion tax revenue hit to the state that follows the law’s passage.
More than a dozen Democratic state lawmakers, including Senate President James Coleman and House Speaker Julie McCluskie, attended the presentation Thursday. Democrats have strong majorities in the state House and Senate.










The reconciliation law is dramatically and rapidly diminishing affordability of health insurance.


– Adam Fox, Colorado Consumer Health Initiative’s deputy director


Gabriela Walters, the director of quality, risk and compliance at Tepeyac Community Health Center in Denver, said the nonprofit served 7,500 patients last year, about a third of whom rely on Medicare and another 55% of whom have no health insurance. She said that the new law will “negatively impact our financial stability and sustainability.”
“We believe that the results of many of our patients who are on Medicaid losing coverage (is that it) will make them less likely to seek preventive and primary care and more likely to delay care until concerns are more severe, which will ultimately lead to sicker patients and sicker communities,” Walters said.
Presenters pointed to cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also made under the new federal law, as damaging to the health and food security of low-income Coloradans.
The law changes SNAP by broadening work requirements, penalizing states with higher error rates of under- or over-payments, and, for the first time, requiring states to share some of the costs of providing SNAP benefits. 
Ron Meehan, the government relations manager at Feeding Colorado, said about 36,000 Coloradans are at risk of losing SNAP benefits, adding that this will increase the burden on food banks.
“The overarching message is that Colorado’s anti-hunger network is going to be expected to do a lot more with a lot less,” he said.

Photo taken September 9, 2024. (USDA Forest Service photo by Brandon Yoder.)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks last week launched its third interactive dashboard providing greater public insight into the department’s bear management programs.
The new bear relocation dashboard shows general locations where FWP has relocated black and grizzly bears, making members of the public and landowners more aware of where and when bears are transplanted throughout the state.
While the department has listed relocation information on its website in teh past, the new interactive map becomes an easier-to-digest resource for communities, FWP noted in a press release.
“These tools are useful for the public to understand what’s happening with bears around the state,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in the release. “The expansion of grizzly bears both in numbers and in distribution has a real impact on the lives of Montanans across bear country. Keeping people informed about what FWP is doing with bears continues to be a top priority for me.”
FWP is required by law to inform the county and tribal government within 24 hours of which the grizzly bear or black bear is to be relocated. Grizzly bears can only be relocated by FWP to sites approved by the Fish and Wildlife Commission. Under state law, grizzly bears that cause conflicts outside of designated recovery zones cannot be relocated by FWP staff. The dashboard only reflects bears relocated by FWP.
According to the dashboard, as of July 31, 14 bears — six grizzlies and eight black bears — have been relocated within Montana this year.
This is the third dashboard FWP has launched in the last year to bolster public insight into the departments bear management actions.
Last fall, FWP announced its grizzly mortality dashboard in an effort to increase transparency, educate Montanans on why grizzlies are killed or die when they are currently federally protected, and to show that the state’s management strategy indicates its ready to manage grizzly bears in portions of the state on its own.
The state has long pushed for grizzlies to be delisted from the Endangered Species List, and legislation to do so is pending before Congress.
Earlier this summer, FWP developed and launched a grizzly bear conflict dashboard to highlight where and when people and bears interact in negative ways.
The Relocation Dashboard provides general locations for areas where FWP staff have relocated bears. Details of each location can be found by clicking on “Table” at the top of the dashboard, according to FWP.
For more information on grizzly and black bear conflict prevention and management, FWP has many web-based resources for communities, landowners and recreationists.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54148462531_f1787efd57_k-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-31 19:57:12.260286

Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital in St. Johnsbury announced upcoming cuts to staff and two hospital programs on Tuesday, joining other medical facilities across the state making similar announcements.The cuts, which will take effect Sept. 30, include five positions: three in occupational medicine and one each in community health coordination and physical therapy, the hospital said in a press release this week. These staffing cuts come on top of three administrative positions cut earlier this year.The hospital will be shuttering its occupational medicine office — that works “onboarding new employees with physicals and immunizations” — transferring partial services to Northern Express Care, which operates three walk-in clinics in northeastern Vermont. Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital will also be ending its partnership for ear, nose and throat care with Littleton Regional Healthcare, transitioning patients to the hospital’s own providers.“I want to emphasize that these reductions are in no way a reflection of performance or dedication — they’re about ensuring that our organization remains strong and resilient for the communities we serve,” the hospital’s CEO Shawn Tester said in the release.
Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital is one of the Northeast Kingdom’s largest providers of health care. According to regulator Green Mountain Care Board, the hospital is in the mid-range of its peer facilities across the state, with over $120 million patient revenue, the sixth highest in fiscal year 2024. 
In the Thursday release, Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital officials said more may be needed to ensure the hospital’s financial future, including adjustments made to employees schedules like reductions in overtime, “efficiency improvements” for hospital technology, and a review of certain employee benefits for “identify potential savings with minimal impact, including early retirement options for those who qualify.”“In order to assist in lowering the cost of health care for Vermonters, while keeping essential services local, we must find savings,” Tester said. “These difficult decisions are necessary to …  preserve our ability to serve the Northeast Kingdom well into the future.”In the release, the hospital blamed “rising labor and supply costs, reduced reimbursement rates and regulatory budget requirements,” for the cuts. 
Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital is not the only hospital or medical system facing similar issues. 
In June, Brattleboro Hospital laid off hospital leaders to address a $4 million hole in its budget. The University of Vermont Health Network announced it would be cutting 77 positions in the same week Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital announced its cuts. 
These layoffs come as Vermont’s health care leaders look to address the systemic challenges — an aging population and a large number financially challenged hospitals — of a “badly broken” health care system that have resulted in increasingly high health insurance costs. The cuts also come as hospitals brace for the impacts of the Trump administration’s incoming cuts to Medicaid insurance.“NVRH isn’t going anywhere. We’re here for the long haul and we’re deeply grateful to our entire team for their commitment,” Tester said.

Four players who won the NCAA Division I soccer championship with UVM last year will be on the field for Vermont Green in its own final on Saturday.

BURLINGTON — Some seven months ago, Maxi Kissel, clad in the green and gold of the University of Vermont men’s soccer team, slotted home the goal that won Vermont its first national collegiate championship — in any major sport — in school history.
Winning one national title would be impressive enough. But on Saturday, Kissel, along with three other players who lifted the NCAA Division I trophy for UVM last fall, will be on the university’s home field in Burlington to compete for a second one.
This time, they’ll be playing for Vermont Green Football Club, a semi-professional team also based in the Queen City. The Green compete in United Soccer League 2, which has about 150 teams across the country. The clubs field mostly college players who often hope the summertime showcase will attract the eyes of professional scouts.
“It’s a bit surreal,” Kissel said Wednesday afternoon, taking a break during a team training session at UVM’s Virtue Field. In just a few days, the stadium’s bleachers and surrounding fences are set to be lined with thousands of fans for the 7 p.m. game against Ballard FC, a team that’s based just north of downtown Seattle.

“It’s like, wow — we haven’t lost a game in ages,” said Kissel, who’s a forward from Germany, speaking about himself and his peers on both UVM and Vermont Green. (Vermont Green has gone undefeated so far this season.) “We just do our best every day — and, thankfully, good things happen.”
Kissel has played a key role on Vermont Green’s offense in recent weeks. He scored one of the three goals the team needed to overcome FC Motown of New Jersey in an early round of the United Soccer League 2 playoffs this month. Then, in last Sunday’s semifinals, he notched a goal in Vermont’s dramatic, penalty-kick shootout win over Alabama’s Dothan United.
Vermont would not have won that semifinal without another UVM stalwart — goalkeeper Niklas Herceg, also from Germany, who blocked two of Dothan United’s penalty kicks during the shootout. UVM defender Nathan Siméon, of Quebec, and midfielder Ryan Zellefrow, of Pennsylvania, have also been go-to starters for the Green’s playoff run.

“With the UVM team, we kind of went into the games — especially in the college (tournament) — knowing like, no matter what happens, we were going to win,” said Zellefrow, also during Wednesday’s training. “And this team feels so similar.”
That two Vermont-based soccer teams have found so much success, one so soon after the other, feels unlikely in a state with no professional sports franchises of its own. But players and coaches said the pair of national tournament runs is hardly a coincidence.
UVM’s championship win — a product, in part, of a roster bolstered by top players recruited from around the country and the world (the case for many college teams) — “captured the imagination of so many people around the state,” said Chris Taylor, Vermont Green’s head coach, in an interview after Wednesday’s training wrapped up.
Having more Vermonters interested in soccer, in turn, helped Vermont Green build on what was already some of the highest average home game attendance of any team in United Soccer League 2 in the country, Taylor said. Vermont Green’s semifinal drew about 4,000 spectators out to the UVM stadium, and Saturday’s match could see more.

“They paved the way, I think, for this season. We’ve obviously got some of their best players as well,” Talyor added, speaking about the UVM men’s soccer team. “I don’t think we have the season we’re having without UVM’s season.”
Zellefrow noted that Vermont Green’s robust fanbase has also spurred talented collegiate players who hail from other countries, which have had strong soccer fan cultures for far longer than the U.S., to want to spend the summer playing in Burlington.
More than half of the players on Vermont Green’s current roster were born outside the U.S, according to the club’s website. 
“I think those guys, when they come to Vermont and see the fans, and the community and so forth, they feel like they’re at home,” said Rob Dow, the UVM men’s soccer coach. “They’re talking about, ‘Oh, I grew up in this power club in Germany, or in Belgium or France — but I never felt this type of energy before.’”

Like UVM last year, Vermont Green has made several late-game comebacks this year to keep its season going. Some fans have loaned the team versions of the “Cardiac Cats” nickname UVM’s team earned in 2024 after a similar series of late-stage heroics. 
Taylor, the Vermont Green coach, said his team has been successful at the tail end of games in part because of its deep bench of talented players who can be brought in as substitutes with fresher legs, essentially helping Vermont “just outlast” other teams.
It’s a strength that will likely be put to the test in Saturday’s final against Ballard FC, Taylor said, which has consistently been among the best United Soccer League 2 teams in the country in recent years. Ballad won the national championship game in 2023. 
“They make games really fast,” Taylor said. “Their pressure is really good. They’re a pretty relentless team.”
Kissel, the UVM and Vermont Green forward, said he, too, was confident in the team’s ability to come back late if needed. He credited the fans’ unabated support — but agreed the parallels with his college team’s run are hard to ignore. 
“Maybe it’s a Vermont thing,” he said, smiling.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the man accused of killing two people at Devil’s Den State Park over the weekend, officials announced Thursday.
Washington County Prosecuting Attorney Brandon Carter said the man arrested and charged in the case, Andrew James McGann, is “innocent until proven guilty.” Still, Carter said it was his “intention to use the full weight of my office to bring this defendant to justice for the Brinks’ family.”

“This case certainly has the aggravators … it is my intention to pose that to a jury, so the state will not be waiving the death penalty in this case,” Carter said.
The two victims, Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, were visiting the popular state park south of Fayetteville on July 26 with their two daughters, ages 7 and 9, when officials say the parents were stabbed and killed in a “heinous” and “completely random” act of violence.
The girls were not injured and are safe with family, according to an Arkansas State Police news release.
State Police officials said at a press conference Thursday that a motive was still under investigation.
The family had recently moved to the state from North Dakota, and were originally from California, according to officials.
Investigators have not identified any connection between the Brinks and the 28-year-old suspect, officials said.
McGann was arrested Wednesday without resistance by ASP special agents at a barbershop in Springdale.

Officials said “close to ten” videos sent in by members of the public helped them eventually determine that the vehicle seen leaving the park was a Kia Stinger.
Investigators then used descriptions provided by the Brinks’ daughters and another witness who had seen the man leave the park to search through vehicle ownership data and narrow their search to McGann.
The isolation and lack of cell service at the location of the crime also posed a challenge for investigators.
“I want to thank the public for providing images and videos” that “directly resulted in this person being brought into custody,” Department of Public Safety Secretary Mike Hagar said. “It allowed our investigators a starting point to move forward.”
Maj. Stacie Rhoads, commander of ASP’s Criminal Investigation Division, said when investigators interviewed McGann, he made an “admission” that he had committed the murders, but she would not elaborate further on what he specifically said. Investigators believe he acted alone.
State police learned Thursday that DNA collected from blood left at the scene matched McGann’s, Hagar said.
Rhoads said they have not identified any previous “adult” criminal history, nor are they aware of any connections to other “incidents” in Arkansas.
McGann had recently moved to the area and got a job working at a local school district after stints living in Oklahoma and Texas and working in schools in those states, officials said. Springdale Public Schools confirmed it had hired McGann but said he had not yet begun employment, 40/29 News reported.
ASP officials said they were still looking into whether he had a history of mental illness.
Rhoads said the case was one of the most disturbing of her 27-year career.
“This is, it was every agent’s worst nightmare,” Rhoads said. “In a typical investigation … you can typically narrow down your suspect pool. We had no way to do that in this case, so it made it particularly difficult.”
She also said the suspect was “very sloppy.”
Once investigators determined McGann was their suspect, he was taken into custody “within the hour,” Rhoads said.

Rhoads said investigators found unspecified evidence at McGann’s home consistent with an image police previously released of the suspect. Rhoads said investigators have not yet identified if any of the knives they collected from McGann’s home match the one used to kill the Brinks.
Hagar emphasized that state parks are safe for the public despite the violence of the deaths. Violence of this magnitude is quite rare at state parks, according to reporting from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
Rhoads also criticized “keyboard warriors” for social media posts that “absolutely hindered” their investigation into the killings and caused “hurt” and “emotional toil” to the victims’ family.
“Misinformation hurts,” Hagar said, adding that the family expressed to him that the ensuing social media discussion has resulted in people speculating and saying things that “simply aren’t true.”
“They don’t deserve to be victimized any further than they already are,” Hagar said.

It also authorizes the deployment of the Utah National Guard if needed, and streamlines assistance for local governments.

In an executive order, the governor cited severe drought as one cause exacerbating wildfire hazards. As of Thursday, the National Weather Service had identified 22 red flag warning days in Utah, a caution used when extreme fire behavior is likely, including a combination of high winds, low humidity and dry conditions, posing a high risk of wildfires.
“Heroic efforts are underway as firefighters and emergency personnel work around the clock to save homes and neighborhoods,” Cox said in a statement. “We are mobilizing every tool at our disposal to support them and keep Utahns safe.” 
This year Utah has recorded 693 fires, which have burned nearly 114,000 acres, according to the order. Over 100,000 of those burnt acres were due to the four largest active wildfires in the state. The cost of fighting them has exceeded $103 million. 
On Friday, the governor is scheduled to travel to the Monroe Canyon fire to hear a briefing on the disaster that has expanded to more than 37,000 acres and destroyed seven cabins and homes. 
“Shifting winds, abundant dry fuels, and fast-moving flames continue to threaten the surrounding community. The governor will continue to urge residents to follow evacuation orders and stay clear of the area so first responders can operate safely and effectively,” Cox’s office said in the release.
About 70% of wildfires in the state have been human-caused. Cox advised Utahns to reduce sparks from everyday activities.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A former Pulaski County Clerk employee has been charged with a felony in connection with voter registration tampering last year.
Deborah Smith, 57, of North Little Rock surrendered to authorities Thursday after investigators with Attorney General Tim Griffin’s Election Integrity Unit obtained a warrant for her arrest, Griffin said in a press release.
The State Board of Election Commissioners this spring referred a complaint it received from Pulaski County election commissioners about a possible election integrity violation. The state board asked the attorney general’s office and the county prosecuting attorney to investigate the switching of 132 voter registrations from North Little Rock to Maumelle ahead of the 2024 general election.
“We determined during our investigation that Smith deliberately switched the voter registrations while employed at the clerk’s office. She is charged with one count of violation of voter eligibility, a Class D felony,” Griffin’s press release said.
Smith resigned from her position in Clerk Terri Hollingsworth’s voter registration department on Oct. 24, according to blogger Snarky Media. That was two days after Hollingsworth initiated an investigation into the alleged switch. The precinct switch allegedly occurred on the first day of early voting, Oct. 21.
In an Oct. 28 letter to county election commissioners, Hollingsworth said her office took steps to correct the changed precincts, but four voters had already voted before the fixes were made.

Smith was processed at the Pulaski County Detention Center on Thursday and released on her own recognizance, Griffin said.
Griffin said his office’s investigation is continuing. 
“Preserving the integrity of our elections is foundational to maintaining our democracy,” he said in a press release. “Instances like this in Arkansas are rare, but to keep them from becoming more frequent, the response of justice must be swift and decisive.”
Secretary of State Cole Jester, who is chairman of the state election commissioners board, thank Griffin for his office’s work on the case.
“Intentional violations of election law should always be met with criminal charges,” Jester said in a statement.
Online news outlet South Arkansas Reckoning first reported in November about Hollingsworth’s letter to county election commissioners about the changed precincts and what she’d done about it.
In May, the State Board of Election Commissioners reprimanded Hollingsworth for the precinct changes and issued a warning letter to her for having failed to prevent unauthorized changes to voter records.

State Sen. Wes Climer officially launched his campaign for South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District, making him the first to declare a run for the seat that stretches from the state’s Charlotte suburbs south into Sumter County.
The Rock Hill Republican announced during a York County GOP event Thursday night that he would seek the seat held by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman. Norman has decided to run for governor rather than seek re-election during the 2026 midterm that will determine control of Congress.
If elected, Climer said he will “focus on the best interests of the middle class” and be a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump’s America First Agenda, which calls for immigration controls, increased fossil fuel production, decreased regulation, spending cuts and protective tariffs aimed at encouraging U.S.-based manufacturing.
“The old playbook obviously doesn’t work,” Climer said. “The cost of everything is too high. The basic functions of government are incompetent. U.S. trade policy is divorced from the interest of the middle class. It’s about fixing those broken systems so middle class families can thrive.”
Climer paints himself as a fiscal hawk who wants to reduce the federal deficit and pay down debt.
“Washington spends far too much money,” he said. “The U.S. faces a real debt crisis with real implications for middle class families.”
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget office estimated that the recent tax and spending bill pushed by Trump and passed by the Republican-controlled Congress will add $3.394 trillion to deficits during the next decade.
In the federal government, Congress controls the purse strings, determining spending and taxation. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank controls interest rates and money supply.
“The most impactful thing Washington can do to bring down prices is to reduce the cost of Washington on the economy,” Climer said.
The three-term state senator was first elected to the Statehouse in 2016 after unseating long-time incumbent Sen. Wes Hayes by 4 percentage points in the GOP primary.
Climer campaigned on promises to improve the state’s roads and strengthen ethics laws governing elected officials. He came into office in the same wave that swept Trump, then a political outsider, into his first term in the White House.
In the Statehouse, Climer has been a critic of hundreds of millions of state dollars funneled to legislators’ pet projects via earmarks and the secrecy that previously surrounded the process.
A free market proponent, he also was the lead sponsor of legislation that gradually did away with the regulatory process, known as certificate of need, that was designed to control competition within the healthcare market in an effort to protect rural hospitals.
And he teamed with former state Senate Democrat Dick Harpootlian on legislation to tweak how the state elects judges, imposing term limits on members of the panel that screens them.
The two joined forces again this summer, most recently asking the state’s highest court to halt a $2,500-monthly raise that legislators voted for themselves to cover expenses incurred while working in their home districts.
Senator sues over his own raise, arguing it violates SC constitution

This also wouldn’t be Climer’s first time in Washington, D.C. if he’s elected. He previously worked from 2006 to 2011 as a congressional aide in the Washington offices of former U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry and former U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, both North Carolina Republicans, as well as Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, when he was a congressman.
In 2011, Climer began working as a financial consultant. And in 2013, he became chairman of the York County GOP until his successful run for the Statehouse.
Other congressional races
In other congressional races, Paul Dans, an author of Project 2025, announced he was jumping into the already crowded primary race against U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who Dans called a “perpetual warmonger.”
“Lindsey Graham has betrayed South Carolina conservatives for the last time,” Dans said in a statement. “While he schemes with the D.C. swamp to send billions overseas and push for endless wars, I’ve been at work to enable President Trump to implement the America First agenda that’s reshaping America into the country we have always dreamed of.”
Dans, an attorney who worked in the first Trump administration as White House liaison to the office of personnel management, went to work for the Heritage Foundation after former President Joe Biden’s defeat of Trump in 2020. There he helped author the 1,000-page policy paper once billed as a blueprint for the next Republican White House.
Dans left the Heritage Foundation in July 2024 amid blowback over Project 2025, which Trump distanced himself from on the campaign trail.
Dans now lives in Charleston with his wife and four children.
Others in the running include former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer and Greenville businessman Mark Lynch.

(Photo courtesy of the Arkansas House)The state’s Democrats and Legislative Black Caucus on Thursday condemned a “Whites Only” community in Northeast Arkansas and urged the attorney general to investigate. 
Reports began circulating last month about acreage being purchased by Return to the Land, a “private membership association” for people with “traditional views and European ancestry,” according to the group’s website. 
Attorney General Tim Griffin told the Independent last week that “racial discrimination has no place in Arkansas or anywhere in a free society,” and that his office was reviewing the matter. Griffin’s spokesperson told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Tuesday that a preliminary review of the community hasn’t revealed evidence that the group has broken the law.  
Arkansas Democrats responded Thursday by calling on Griffin’s office to pursue an investigation. Arkansas Legislative Black Caucus Chair Rep. Jay Richardson, D-Fort Smith, said the association excluding people based on race, religion and sexual orientation “runs counter to Arkansas values and potentially violates civil rights protections.”
“I am deeply concerned that Arkansas is being portrayed nationally as tolerant of discriminatory practices,” Richardson said in a statement. “This does not represent the Arkansas I know and serve. Our state has made tremendous progress, and we cannot allow extremist elements to define us or roll back decades of civil rights advancement.”
‘Whites-only’ group draws bipartisan rebuke over potential move to Missouri 

Richardson argued this type of discrimination contributes to “an ongoing brain drain” that the state can’t afford. He called on Griffin’s office “to complete a thorough investigation and take appropriate legal action if violations are found.”
Rep. Nicole Clowney, a Fayetteville Democrat and lawyer, argued the community is illegal. 
“Let’s be clear: The Civil Rights Act of 1866 says that you can’t discriminate in the sale of property based on race. There are no exceptions. None. A ‘whites only’ real estate development clearly runs afoul of that,” Clowney said in a statement. 
Return to the Land states on its website that it does not engage in real estate sales or rentals. The group argues that the owners of private property can determine who has the right to access their property.
“We have the God-given right to form communities according to whatever values we hold dear,” Eric Orwoll, co-founder of Return to the Land, said in a recent social media post, “and the government does not have the right to tell free American citizens what values they have to live according to in their own private lives.”
The group’s leader recently said it is exploring the idea of expanding north and building a new enclave near Springfield, Missouri, according to the Missouri Independent. 
Both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers in Missouri have spoken out against the proposed community. 
In an emailed statement to the Missouri Independent, a spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said racial discrimination “has no place in Missouri.”

On Wednesday, Attorney General Charity Clark announced a $210,500 settlement with St. Albans Creamery over alleged violations of the pretreatment permit at its milk and dairy processing facility in St. Albans.
The Creamery has a pretreatment discharge permit with the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources that authorizes it to discharge wastewater that it pre-treats at the dairy into the St. Albans wastewater treatment facility.
But the Agency found that the Creamery violated the permit multiple times from 2021 to 2024. The alleged violations include release of a substantial amount of raw milk and cream into the town’s wastewater facility, which interfered with normal operations and led to contamination of Stevens Brook, which empties into Lake Champlain. Other violations relate to excess flow limits, phosphorous limits and biological oxygen demand, pH levels, and inadequate staffing of the facility.
“We all treasure our environment and natural resources in Vermont. Environmental permits are designed to protect our natural resources,” Attorney General Clark said in a press release. “I am very pleased that St. Albans Creamery has made a commitment to take the necessary actions to prevent further harmful discharges of raw milk wastes.”
Clark filed the proposed settlement in Franklin Superior Court on July 28.
The Creamery committed to pay the state a civil penalty of $210,500 and implement corrective actions. Within 60 days after the order is officially entered by the court, the Creamery will be required to submit a compliance plan to the Department of Environmental Conservation, including a staffing plan to employ sufficient licensed operators.
Dairy Farmers of America, the St. Albans Creamery’s parent company, wrote in a statement that they made significant investments to upgrade the facility’s wastewater treatment system. “The upgraded system is better equipped to effectively manage and treat wastewater in compliance with the facility’s Pretreatment Discharge Permit,” the statement reads.
Dairy Farmers of America declined to comment further on Thursday.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-07-31 23:04:42+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Few released under NJ law meant to allow gravely ill inmates to die at home,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/07/31/few-released-under-nj-law-meant-to-allow-gravely-ill-inmates-to-die-at-home/,Only four people have been freed under a 2020 compassionate release law meant to allow more gravely ill inmates to die at home.,"State judges have denied most of the applications from incarcerated people who met eligibility requirements for early release. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)When New Jersey lawmakers passed a compassionate release law in 2020 meant to give more seriously ill people a path out of prison, they cheered the move as “the right thing to do” and projected it would save the state “significant amounts of money in medical costs.”
But four and a half years since it took effect, only four people have been released under the law — representing just .03% of the total prison population, which averaged about 12,900 over that period, state Department of Corrections data shows.

Department doctors determined that 36 incarcerated people who were terminally ill or permanently physically incapacitated met the eligibility requirements for release, but state Superior Court judges denied 29 applicants (another three await court decisions), the data shows. The department did not provide numbers on how many incarcerated people requested compassionate release but were rejected as ineligible.
Surraya Johnson is director of the criminal justice reform program at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. She said four people in over four years is a “disappointingly low” number and surely “not what the legislators had intended,” given that the compassionate release law was meant to free more people than the restrictive 1997 medical release law it repealed and replaced.
“I think that the lawmakers enact these bills with the best intentions of getting reform,” Johnson said. “But reform work sometimes can be slow, after a bill is enacted, to get it into practice. As much effort is put into getting legislation passed, we have to put equal, if not more, effort into making sure that that legislation is properly enacted and executed.”
She added: “Accountability is oftentimes synonymous with transparency, and so I think making this information public will help motivate legislators to hold the state agencies accountable, to make sure that their legislation is being enacted in the way that they envisioned.”
Marleina Ubel, a senior policy analyst with progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, called on policymakers to investigate why so few people have been released under the law, which was signed in October 2020 and took effect in early 2021. Ubel called compassionate release denials “cruel,” considering most applicants are elderly.
“We know that geriatric populations are the least likely to recommit any kind of crime. They’re one of the safest populations. So this is not about public safety,” she said.
The low numbers may be partly due to ongoing disagreement over eligibility, with court challenges arising over exactly what permanent physical incapacity means and whether people convicted of especially heinous crimes could apply. Most recently, the justices had to parse the law’s particulars on whether doctors must examine applicants in person to assess their medical condition. They do not, the court ruled Monday, although justices decreed that examinations must be timely.
Some of those who sought compassionate release in recent years include:

Celestine Payne, 75, who poisoned her husband, got her autistic tenant and children to help her dispose of the body, and enlisted her daughter’s boyfriend in another murder, among other crimes. The state Supreme Court in January acknowledged Payne suffered from “permanent physical incapacity” but said her crimes were too horrific to justify early release. 
Eddie L. Oliver, aka Al-Damany Kamau, who gunned down a Newark detective in an Essex County courthouse, shot and wounded two other officers, and planned to kill a judge. Oliver, who was bedridden at the end of his life, died at 54, six months after the state Supreme Court denied his bid for release.
A 76-year-old man identified only as F.E.D. in court records who has been imprisoned since 1980 for three murders. His “diminished” ability to perform daily living activities was not enough to justify early release, the state’s high court ruled in 2022.
A man with brain cancer, identified as M.R. and serving a sentence for racketeering, who applied for compassionate release in February 2023 but was denied eligibility by state corrections officials. He died in June 2024, a month after he asked the state Supreme Court to review his case. The court ruled Monday that state officials wrongly relied on old medical records to deny him eligibility for early release.

The Department of Corrections relies on assessments by doctors from Rutgers University Correctional Health Care — the prison system’s designated health care provider — to determine eligibility for compassionate release, along with input from incarcerated people and their families, attorneys, and advocates, said Daniel Sperrazza, a department spokesman.
One advocate regards the low number of people granted compassionate release — whatever its cause — as one of several failures by state officials to follow through on their promises to reduce New Jersey’s prison population.
Bonnie Kerness, coordinator of the American Friends Service Committee’s prison watch program, pointed to the state’s inaction on closing its long-troubled youth jails and stalled progress on Gov. Phil Murphy’s vow to keep parole violators out of prison. Murphy also did not exercise his clemency powers for most of his eight years in office, Kerness added, although she acknowledged his flurry of pardons and commutations since December.
“There are so many ways that we can decarcerate people. These things all tie in together. They’re very much connected,” Kerness said. “It’s concerning that they are not happening in the way that they should be.”
Stalling on decarceration efforts also is costly, Ubel added.
Victoria Kuhn, the department’s commissioner, has testified before state lawmakers about the high health care costs of incarcerating elderly and ill people. And Murphy said in February that keeping technical parole violators out of prison would enable the state to close a correctional facility, likely East Jersey State Prison in Woodbridge.
“Not only is it the humane thing to do, the moral thing to do, but it is actually the economic thing to do for the state,” Ubel said.

(Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas bank regulators informed legislators Thursday a corrective action order would be issued to the state-chartered subsidiary of the Beneficient company engaged in illiquid-asset transactions and that the agency would engage in continuous monitoring of the subsidiary rather than rely on annual assessments.
Controversy associated primarily with Dallas-headquartered Beneficient, the parent company of Beneficient Financial Fiduciary, factored into decisions to revise the state’s approach to oversight of the subsidiary, said David Herndon, who serves as Kansas State Bank commissioner.
“Several publicly disclosed adverse acts have taken place at Beneficient and have elevated our concern about the waterfall effect on BFF,” he said.
Herndon told a joint House and Senate oversight committee that Beneficient submitted a 2024 report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that included a “lack of a going concern” clause drafted by Beneficient auditors who suggested the company could be on the verge of insolvency. Beneficient’s follow-up report to the SEC due for 2025 hasn’t been filed.
Beneficient’s stock price has fallen below minimum levels required to be listed by Nasdaq. Beneficient’s insurance carrier settled for $50 million a lawsuit alleging Beneficient executives, including founder and CEO Brad Heppner, drove Beneficient’s former parent company into bankruptcy.
Heppner recently resigned to avoid appearing before the Beneficient board of directors’ audit committee examining documents tied to potential financial irregularities. An SEC filing revealed Heppner recommended Beneficient wind down its business operations.
“This revelation directly contradicts testimony Mr. Heppner provided this committee last November when he assured the committee of a bright future,” Herndon said.
Herndon said the annual examination of BFF had been completed in July. Contents of that report cannot be made public under state law.
Herndon said events associated with Beneficient reinforced his opinion the Legislature ought to consider withdrawing BFF’s state charter and repeal the state law offering companies such as Beneficient the state’s regulatory stamp of approval.
Alan Deines, managing director of BFF, said Herndon’s disclosure regarding issuance of a corrective action order was puzzling.
“We understand that there’s maybe going to be a consent order,” Deines said. “Feel like, a little bit by implication, there’s some serious wrongdoing involved with that. I’m not aware of any.”
 
‘Incredible visionary’
Perspectives of three executives with Beneficient or BFF offered to the Joint Fiduciary Financial Institutions Oversight Committee clashed with Herndon’s analysis.
Derek Fletcher, Beneficient’s chief fiduciary officer and president, appeared at the committee hearing in an attempt to calm lawmakers skeptical about Beneficient’s future. He was aware Beneficient executives and politicians in the past had inaccurately predicted fortunes would be made through the state charter given to BFF and that new companies would be drawn to Kansas to transact international business deals.
“As the committee knows, we have faced a number of challenges and headwinds in the past and, admittedly, the business has not performed the way we had hoped and really envisioned it would,” Fletcher said. “We’re enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead, despite the challenges that have existed.”
Fletcher said Heppner, the former CEO, was an “incredible visionary” and “incredibly intelligent person.” Fletcher disagreed with Heppner’s recommendation that Beneficient should be shut down.
“It is not the view of the company,” Fletcher said. “We do not believe that to be in the best interest of our shareholders and we intend to continue to operate.”
Fletcher said none of the millions of dollars from Beneficient or BFF sitting in trust accounts for potential use by the Kansas Department of Commerce for economic development grants or by a charitable foundation in Hesston for benefit of that town would be at risk if Beneficient failed. Closure of the company would stop the flow of additional resources to Kansas, but it wouldn’t prompt a claim on the trust account.
He said the commitment to build a grocery store in Hesston — Heppner’s hometown — remained solid. The plan would be to downsize the grocery project from “opulent” to “nice” so a reasonable timeline could be pursued, he said.
“As a company, we know we have a lot of work to do. We’re committed to doing that. We are simply going to assure this committee that we’re dedicated to working hard,” Fletcher said.
 
‘Hung by headlines’
Deines, the BFF director and a former banking consultant and educator, said the 2021 deal struck with the Legislature to exchange a Kansas bank charter for infusion of economic development funding to cities with less than 5,000 people had proven successful.
The Kansas bank commission has relied on annual payments from Beneficient to finance regulatory reviews of BFF while the state Department of Commerce distributed $25,000 community improvement project grants to businesses and public facilities, he said.
The new grocery store promised four years ago for Hesston hasn’t been built, but Deines said lack of appreciation for the positive side of the public-private partnership was frustrating.
“There’s days when I feel like we’re being hung by headlines,” Deines said. “If you look at the bigger picture here, we’re doing great things.”
He said reputational issues were a problem for Beneficient. Those distractions included a flurry of lawsuits involving current and former executives as well as news coverage of Beneficient’s financial and leadership challenges.
Interim Beneficient CEO James Silk, who had served as a Beneficient attorney until 2024, said he accepted the offer to return last month “because I believe in Ben and I believe in what the company can be.”
“Ben has certainly faced challenges and perhaps in a departure from a predecessor I’ll acknowledge that success is not something that can be guaranteed,” Silk said. “What I can guarantee, on behalf of myself and the rest of the management team, is that we will lead the company going forward with integrity, professionalism and civility.”
Silk said Beneficient, with the bank charter issued to BFF, had an opportunity to profit from catering to people or companies holding rigid assets that needed to be converted to cash for stock.
He spoke directly to legislators on the oversight committee, including those from the Hesston area promised economic development investments tied to Beneficient. He said he was aware of their expressions of public support for Beneficient in the past, and that “this belief is not misplaced.”
 
Legislative scrutiny
Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Wichita Republican who chairs the oversight committee, said the August hearing was called due to the dramatic changes at Beneficient.
“I thought it would be prudent to bring everybody in to have a discussion about what’s going on,” he said. “I believe it would be prudent for us to come back at a later date down the road.”
He said a second meeting in October or November could allow Beneficient to work through a transitional phase and to provide legislators for additional requested documents. There also was committee discussion of diverting a portion of Beneficient’s funding to the state for a marketing campaign on behalf of Beneficient that would be conducted by the state Department of Commerce.
Republican Sen. Stephen Owens of Hesston, who supported the law allowing BFF to secure a state charter, said it was important to acknowledge the influence of economic development funding flowing to communities statewide. He took exception to the bank commissioner’s request to revoke BFF’s charter and terminate the so-called TEFFI Act applicable to this type of financial institution.
“I certainly think we can agree that the TEFFI Act hasn’t worked out quite as we had planned,” said Owens, who quizzed the bank commissioner on whether anyone in Kansas had been harmed by BFF’s use of the charter.
“I can’t speak to if there are any Kansans who have shares of the parent company (Beneficient),” Herndon said. “I can say that if there are some, they have lost significant value.”
Owens said the Department of Commerce distributed more than $3 million in grants to Kansas communities that were financed by the state’s alliance with Beneficient and BFF.
“I don’t know that another industry that started up in the last couple of years that’s contributed that much to Kansas,” Owens said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Herndon-thad.jpg,,,2025-07-31 19:57:12.260286

Scientists will use data captured directly from the lake to closely monitor the ecosystem. (Photo credit: SLU)The Southeastern Louisiana University scientist who discovered alarming levels of toxic chemicals in Lake Maurepas was abruptly removed from her research position this week without explanation.
Fereshteh Emami, an analytical chemistry professor who served as a principal investigator on the Air Products Lake Maurepas Monitoring Project, was officially removed from the project Thursday but is still employed by the university. SELU’s chemistry department has moved Emami into a full-time teaching role and will not allow her to continue the research she has been doing for the past three years, she said.
Emami said she received a vague email Monday from Kyle Piller, a biology professor and director of the Lake Maurepas research effort, saying he “terminated” her from the project. He did not include any explanation for the decision and gave a similarly vague response Wednesday when she asked why, according to emails Emami shared with the Illuminator. 
“Your continued involvement is no longer in the best interest of the Air Products Lake Maurepas Monitoring Project,” Piller’s email stated.
  Dr. Fereshteh Emami (Photo: SELU)
Piller gave virtually the same statement in response to a reporter’s request for comment Thursday, adding that he could not comment on personnel matters.
For the past three years, Emami led a team of researchers who analyzed 400 water and sediment samples collected from multiple locations and depths in the lake from June through December 2023.
The results, which were recently published in two scientific journals, set off alarm bells in communities around Lake Maurepas. The samples showed dangerously high levels of heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, nickel, copper and manganese. The researchers also detected high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, both major components of fertilizers.
Emami developed new methodologies that traced many of the pollutants to industrial and agricultural activities along the Blind, Tickfaw and Amite rivers that feed into Lake Maurepas. The heavy metal concentrations found in the lake are similar to those detected after breaks in the waste containment levees at the Atlantic Alumina (Atalco) facility in Gramercy last year. Atalco’s toxic metals — which also included arsenic, cadmium and lead, among others — ended up in drainage ditches that flow into the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas. 
Right after the Illuminator published an article about Emami’s work in June, she said Southeastern’s communication officials told her she must check with them before speaking with journalists in the future. On Monday, just before she learned of her removal from the research project, Emami said a campus media crew was scheduled to film her work for a university-sponsored documentary. The Lake Maurepas project director canceled the shoot, she said. 
“This documentary was supposed to be about our results from the past three years ago,” Emami said. “It’s like they are wiping me out of the picture.” 
University administrators say Emami’s removal from the Lake Maurepas research work was a routine adjustment.
“While we do not comment on issues related to specific individual personnel matters, changes such as these are common,” spokesman Mike Rivault said. “In order to manage the breadth and timeliness of our vast research projects associated with our new Center for Environmental Research, shifts in those conducting given projects are to be expected.”
As the university’s only analytical chemist, Emami’s removal from the Lake Maurepas project could disrupt or delay a new phase of research that involved analyzing fish and crab tissue samples for toxins. Emami said her team was on track to finish that analysis and publish their work in the coming months. Another research team, led by SLU biologist Chris Murray, trapped crabs that showed physiological signs of heavy metal poisoning. Chemical analysis would be required to actually confirm those symptoms.
Scientists find ‘alarming’ levels of toxic metals, pollution in Lake Maurepas

It’s unclear when or if Piller, the project director, plans to pick someone to replace Emami on the research team. Emami has worked at Southeastern for eight years. Born in Iran, she left the country more than a decade ago to escape persecution and threats from religious authorities there.  
“That was motivation for me to come to the United States,” Emami said.
After working as a research scholar at Bowling Green State University in Ohio and then as a post-doctoral researcher at Clarkson University in New York, Emami became an American citizen through an immigration program for high-achieving individuals who work in fields of national interest.    
Southeastern has been monitoring Lake Maurepas since the proposal of a carbon sequestration project by Air Products & Chemicals. The company plans to use carbon capture technology to trap emissions from its $8 billion hydrogen manufacturing complex in Ascension Parish and take them by pipeline to Lake Maurepas. Air Products will have the capacity to inject an estimated 5 million tons of carbon dioxide per year about a mile below the lakebed. 
In the first half of 2023, Air Products performed seismic testing to map the geological formations under the lake. In August of that year, the company moved a large temporary drilling rig into Lake Maurepas that served as a test well for the collection of core and fluid data, which ended in early 2024.
Emami’s team initially suspected but were ultimately unable to link any chemical pollutants to Air Products’ activity in the lake. Aside from providing a multi-million dollar funding grant, the company played no role in any aspects of the study, its design or the decision to publish the results. 
Air Products did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature is adding staff to help lawmakers better analyze policy and evaluate whether programs are effective.
Legislative Council is adding 25 staff members in 2025-27, starting with recruiting four policy analysts to help with research, policy proposals and other analysis. The goal is to expand the nonpartisan research arm of the Legislature and form a policy and program evaluation division, said John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council.
“We’re excited about the idea of having this new resource on our staff where we can engage in what would be a greater legislative oversight function that we’ve never been able to provide before,” Bjornson said.
More than 50 people applied for the initial openings, he said. The new hires could be on board as soon as September.
Legislative Council hired two policy analysts ahead of the 2025 legislative session to assist with property tax legislation and other bills. The additions would allow each legislative committee to have its own analyst.
“It’s been helpful to start it out small with these two, but now we’re ready to make the jump,” Bjornson said. 
The agency also will add 10 program evaluators and a director to oversee the new division. The new hires will examine state initiatives, such as the state investments in child care through the Department of Health and Human Services, to ensure they are effective, he said.
Legislative Council granted 3 more employees to keep up with workload

The program evaluators are expected to play a role with the new Legislative Task Force on Government Efficiency. During the group’s first meeting on Wednesday, members discussed the challenges of examining state programs.
“With this new Legislative Council staff that we have, it will help us actually know what we passed, is it working?” said Rep. Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, chair of the task force.
Because the Legislature only meets every two years, Toman said many of the policies and programs adopted by lawmakers sometimes feel like “knee-jerk” reactions.
“We build the program, we throw the money at it and we don’t know anything about it,” Toman said. 
Legislative Council is expected to grow from 45 members to 70 during this budget cycle, which would still make it among the smallest five legislative support agencies when compared to other states, Bjornson said. Other new North Dakota legislative staff will include information technology, another attorney and editors to review documents, Bjornson said.
Montana’s Legislature, which also meets every two years, had a permanent legislative staff of 143 people in 2021, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. South Dakota had the fewest with 28 permanent staff, according to NCSL.
North Dakota Legislative Council will gain additional office space on the 15th floor of the Capitol to accommodate the new staff members. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed a portion of Senate Bill 2001, which would have reserved the floor for Legislative Council. One of Armstrong’s objections was putting the office space in state law. He also raised concerns about lawmakers not getting input from his administration or Career and Technical Education, the department that occupies the floor now.
Bjornson said the floor had been identified by Capitol facility staff as being underused. The Department of Career and Technical Education is moving out of the Capitol and has a lease that starts Aug. 1 with Bismarck Public Schools. 
In the meantime, the new legislative staff members will work out of vacant committee rooms on the ground floor of the Capitol.
Coincidentally, Bjornson added he will be moderating a session on legislative oversight next week at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston.
“It’s something that has been going on for a long time in state government and we just haven’t had the ability to do it,” he said.

(Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho lost more than a third of its practicing obstetrician doctors after the state’s near-total abortion ban took effect, a new study published in a peer-reviewed academic journal confirms.
The study — published Thursday in the JAMA Network Open, a division of the Journal of the American Medical Association — found that Idaho lost 35% of its doctors who practiced in obstetrics. In total, Idaho lost 94 of those doctors out of 268 between August 2022 and December 2024, the study found.
Idaho’s abortion ban took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned national abortion protections. Some OB-GYNs, including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, said publicly that they were leaving because of the ban. 
“These results provide a stark picture of a rapidly declining maternal health workforce in our state,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Edward McEachern, said in a statement.
The study appears to confirm findings from a report in February 2024 by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative that found Idaho lost 22% of its practicing obstetricians since the state’s abortion bans took effect.

Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws. Organizers are collecting signatures to qualify a ballot initiative in November 2026 that could end Idaho’s strict abortion bans and establish reproductive freedom rights. 
“Since Idaho’s abortion ban went into effect, (the Idaho Medical Association) has raised the alarm about the unintended consequences of criminalizing medically necessary care for pregnant women,” Idaho Medical Association CEO Susie Keller said in a statement. “This study clearly shows how our legal environment is causing physicians to leave the state and making it more difficult to recruit new ones to take their place. Idaho is digging a physician workforce hole that will take years, if not decades, to fill.”
Over 40% of the obstetrics doctors Idaho lost since its abortion bans took effect moved out of state, the study found. More than a fifth retired, but some narrowed their medical practice focus to gynecology or stopped practicing in rural areas, the study found.
The study pulled information from publicly available professional credentialing sources, physician websites, national registries and confirmation from the doctors. 
The vast majority of Idaho’s remaining OB/GYN doctors are practicing in the state’s seven most populated counties, the study found. Just 23 OB/GYN doctors practice in Idaho’s other 37 counties that are home to nearly a quarter of the state’s population, compared to 151 in Idaho’s seven most populated counties, according to the study.

(Screenshot from video)Idaho Falls volunteers will gather Saturday morning to help landscape a new home for an injured veteran. 
Homes For Our Troops is a national nonprofit that builds and donates specially adapted homes for severely injured post-9/11 veterans, like Army Staff Sgt. Christopher Byers, according to a press release. The nonprofit built the accessible home for Byers, and the Volunteer Day on Saturday will focus on landscaping the new home. 
When: Volunteers check in at 9:30 a.m., and landscaping lasts from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturday, Aug. 2
Where: 1615 Helix Blvd. in Idaho Falls
RSVP: Online here.
Byers, serving on his third deployment as an infantryman, stepped on an improvised explosive device, IED, on July 7, 2012, in Mushan, Afghanistan, and lost both his legs below the knees, according to the nonprofit’s website. The blast also resulted in a traumatic brain injury and tinnitus. Byers had to quarantine for a week in Texas upon his arrival because of bacteria he acquired when injured overseas, the website said. 
Byers is now medically retired and lives in Idaho with his five children. 
The new home was meant to support Byers independence, as a single-level house with an open floor plan. 
Saturday’s Volunteer Day is part of the nonprofit’s “mission to not only provide homes — but to engage the community in honoring and uplifting those who have sacrificed for our country,” the release said. 
“Seeing volunteers come out and work side by side to support one of our nation’s finest is incredibly moving,” Homes For Our Troops  President/CEOTom Landwermeyer said in the release. “It will take the entire community to enable our Veterans to fully rebuild their, and their families’ lives.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that Salt Lake City is not violating nuisance laws as homeless camping persists on its streets.
The ruling upholds a decision by a lower court dismissing the lawsuit filed by a group of nine residents and business owners in September 2023, alleging that by not adequately enforcing anti-camping laws against homeless individuals, city officials allowed public and private nuisances to persist across the city for years.
The high court’s decision dismisses the case with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs are unable to refile any similar claims.

Ilan Wurman, an attorney with Tully Bailey, the law firm representing the residents and businesses, said in a statement that the decision leaves concerned Salt Lake City residents with just one remedy — the ballot box.
“The Supreme Court’s ruling that the City may allow encampments on public property — and there is nothing residents can do about it — makes Utah unique among the fifty states. It overturns a century of public nuisance law. Now it’s up to the voters whether they will insist that Salt Lake City fulfill its basic functions to protect its residents,” Wurman wrote.
The Utah Supreme Court’s decision leaned on the public duty doctrine, which it called “a crucial protection” for governments against civil liability as they do their jobs, including precluding claims of “failure to perform a public duty.”
“We acknowledge the difficult realities that Residents are experiencing due to the actions unsheltered people are taking on and near their properties,” Chief Justice Matthew Durrant wrote in the court’s conclusion. “But our sincere sympathy to those difficulties cannot dictate how we apply the law.”
Following the decision, a spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall expressed appreciation for the ruling.
With public safety update, ‘disappointed’ SLC mayor asks state to take city requests more seriously

“Salt Lake City appreciates the Court’s decision, which reaffirms that complex policy matters are best addressed by locally elected officials and policy experts, not the courts. We recognize the very real impacts chronic homelessness can have on residents, businesses, and unsheltered individuals alike, and we remain committed above all to responding with compassion and accountability,” the spokesperson said in a written statement.
The plaintiffs in the case own property in Salt Lake City’s downtown, Central City, and Ballpark neighborhoods. In their complaint, they accused the city of “inviting and fostering vagrancy, public camping, public urination, public defecation, and the public use of illegal drugs (including fentanyl and heroin) on its property, to the detriment of several neighborhoods and businesses.”
The number and condition of unsheltered people in the state’s capital city has also drawn the ire of Gov. Spencer Cox and Republican legislative leaders, who earlier this year mandated that Mendenhall prepare a public safety plan to address crime and homelessness in her city, or the state would take over.
Mendenhall met lawmakers’ deadline, unveiling a multi-pronged plan and emphasizing its success would require support and investment from the state. 
The mayor gave a six-month update on the plan in mid-July, her new police chief at her side, as they reported that crime is down in the city. However, Mendenhall also expressed disappointment over funding that didn’t come through and policy proposals that did not pass the Legislature, urging lawmakers to “give those measures more serious consideration moving forward.”
“This crisis demands sustainable, long-term funding from the state to meet the scale of this challenge in the fastest growing state in this nation,” she said.

The state agency charged with monitoring election fraud in Florida has new leadership.
Jillian Pratt, a former assistant general counsel in the Florida Department of State, was appointed director of the Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security in March. She replaced Andrew Darlington, who accepted a role with the U.S. Department of Justice.


Despite the fact that the change took place several months ago, the Department of State confirmed it only on Thursday, following an inquiry by the Phoenix. The state inadvertently released the news earlier in the day via a court brief filed by Attorney General James Uthmeier in an election lawsuit.
That information was first posted on the Substack page of election integrity activist Christopher Gleason.
  This footnote in a legal brief describes the change in leadership in Florida’s elections crimes office.
Conceived to contend with allegations of election fraud, the Office of Election Crimes and Security was established by the GOP-controlled Florida Legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022. Its responsibility is to conduct preliminary investigations into any alleged irregularities or fraud involving voter registration, voting, candidate or issue petition activities, or any other violation of Florida’s election code.
The agency inserted itself into last fall’s contested election regarding an abortion rights constitutional amendment. It did so by publishing a preliminary report alleging that fraud was committed in the petition-gathering process by Floridians Protecting Freedom, the group working to pass a constitutional amendment. The group initially disputed the allegations, but later dropped its legal challenge.
The Office of Election Crime & Security’s annual report published in January was cited by Republicans who supported a bill passed during the 2025 legislative session that will make it much more challenging for citizen-led ballot initiatives to make it on the ballot in the future. Democrats countered that the report showed that fewer than 20 arrests were made for election fraud.
The agency’s first director was Peter Antonacci, who died in September 2022. His successor was never officially named, but Darlington was listed as office director going back to documents from 2023.
Pratt was promoted to director after serving as an assistant general counsel with the Office of Election Crimes and Security since 2023. Her previous legal work included clerkships with Allen Winsor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida and Timothy D. Osterhaus of Florida’s First District Court of Appeal.
She was a prosecutor in the Second Judicial Circuit, which covers six counties in the Tallahassee area, and an attorney for the Florida Department of Health before coming to the Department of State.
The state noted the change in leadership with the Office of Election Crimes and Security in a legal brief filed by Uthmeier on Thursday in response to a lawsuit alleging election fraud and other irregularities by John Liccione, a Democratic candidate in Florida’s 13th Congressional District in Pinellas County last year.
Liccione finished fifth in the five-person Democratic primary in August 2024 that was won by Whitney Fox. She went on to lose the general election last November to Republican Anna Paulina Luna.

Scroll down for an interactive version. (Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvania won’t share food stamp recipient data with the federal government  – at least for now – citing data security concerns and risking hundreds of millions of dollars in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program aid for more than two million state residents.
The state Department of Human Services, which administers SNAP, released a letter to Gina Brand – senior policy advisor for integrity at the United States Department of Agriculture food, nutrition and consumer services – to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star late Wednesday and declined further comment.
“We are working with our internal teams to understand what would be required to move forward in a way that ensures appropriate safeguards for the individuals we serve,” wrote Hoa Pham, Deputy Secretary of Income Maintenance for Pa. DHS. “We remain committed to complying with all applicable federal and state requirements and to maintaining an open dialogue.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Wednesday was the deadline for states to register an account and start sharing information about SNAP recipients. 
The information sought would include names, addresses, social security numbers, occupation and education information, as well as citizenship, immigration and marital status, according to USDA documents.
The federal agency  has described the initiative as a fraud mitigation effort that could give law enforcement agencies access to the database, stoking concerns that it could be used for other purposes. 
Brand has said states that don’t comply could lose SNAP funding. 
Currently, that’s more than $365 million per month in Pennsylvania.

Pham also cited other states’ recent litigation over the request, in addition to concerns about “privacy, data security, and operational feasibility of the request” outlined recently by the American Public Human Services Association. The association, which posted the letter to USDA detailing those concerns to its website, didn’t respond to an email seeking further comment.
Pennsylvania isn’t among the 21 states with attorneys general who’ve signed onto a lawsuit – which also includes Washington, D.C. – seeking to block the directive. 
Brett Hambright, spokesperson for state Attorney General Dave Sunday, said in an email that the office “will not micromanage the federal government.” 
“Attorney General Sunday is focused on leading a 1,200-person office to preserve public safety, aid consumers, and defend the laws of Pennsylvania,” Hambright wrote.
An addendum to USDA’s original request May 6 says data-sharing has been paused; however, subsequent notices restate the deadline of July 30.
Federal officials also have mentioned coordinating directly with states’ contractors.
Representatives for Conduent, Pennsylvania’s contractor for managing electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Conduent is a contractor in at least 11 other states. Some of its clients – Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey – have joined lawsuits over the USDA directive. 
Citing pending litigation, UFSDA deferred to the Department of Justice and declined to provide a list of states that met the deadline and information about how the agency plans to respond. 
DOJ declined to comment.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch).Bayer, the biotech company and manufacturer of Round Up, has substantially increased its spending on lobbying in Iowa since the introduction of a pesticide labeling bill in 2024. 
In 2025, according to client reports published by the state, Bayer paid lobbyists $123,250. Reports for 2024 show $86,099 spent. Between 2021 and 2023, years before the pesticide labeling bill was introduced, Bayer spent annually between $20,000 and $30,000 on its lobbying efforts. 
An analysis of lobbying data from Food & Water Watch, an environmental group that organized protests and lobbied against the bill, found Bayer’s spending in the cycles since the law was introduced is nearly double what the company spent the decade prior, from 2013 to 2023.

A statement from Bayer said lobbying is a “normal part” of the company’s political engagement, as it is for many other companies. 
“Lobbying is a regulated activity and we engage in an ethical and transparent way across the different divisions of the company – Agriculture, Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health – to support the company’s positions on a number key issues in these industries,” the statement read. 
Jennifer Breon, an Iowa organizer with Food & Water Watch said Bayer is “wasting its money in Des Moines.” 
“Iowans are struggling through a mounting public health crisis with industrial agriculture at its core,” Breon said in a release. “We will not allow Big Ag corporations like Bayer to leverage their ill-begotten pesticide profits to boost private coffers at the expense of the sick.”
About the pesticide bill 
The high-profile pesticide labeling bill does not mention Bayer or its most common pesticide ingredient glyphosate, though the two have been the focus of the bill. 
To date, Bayer has spent more than $10 billion settling lawsuits in which customers claim the pesticide product Roundup, which contains glyphosate, gave them cancer. 
The bill, which was introduced and did not advance in 2024 or 2025 in Iowa, would block someone from suing a pesticide company that followed proper labeling rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Supporters of the bill argue there would still be other claims an individual could make to sue a pesticide company. 
Bayer and Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition of agricultural interest groups across the country, worked to get introduced in a handful of states this year. Versions of the bill were signed into law in North Dakota and in Georgia. 
Opponents of the bill in Iowa, including Food & Water Watch, dubbed it the “cancer gag act.” They argue that pesticide products can cause cancer, and that the bill takes away an Iowan’s right to pursue legal recourse. 
Bayer holds that its product is safe to use, and also that continued litigation, which have payouts in the billions, will lead to a lack of the product’s availability in the country. This in turn, the company argues, would be detrimental to farmers and to American food supplies. 
“Bayer stands behind the safety of our glyphosate-based products which have been tested extensively, approved by regulators and used around the globe for 50 years,” the statement from Bayer said. “The EPA has an extremely rigorous review process which spans multiple years, considers thousands of studies and involves many independent risk assessment experts at the EPA.” 
This year the bill, Senate File 394, drew lots of attention at the Iowa State Capitol and passed from the Senate with a vote of 26-21 in March, but the House did not take up the bill. 
By the numbers 
In addition to the figures spent by Bayer in 2025 and 2024, Modern Ag Alliance, which Bayer is part of, spent $10,000 lobbying in 2025. Other groups, like Iowa Corn Growers Association, Iowa Soybean Association and the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation also registered in support of the bills both years. 
Food & Water Watch’s lobbying budget for 2024 totaled $498, and in 2025, $1,351. In 2025, the group’s lobbyist declared a position on 13 bills.
The bill was also opposed by several legal groups, including the Iowa Academy of Trial Lawyers, the Iowa Association for Justice and the Iowa State Bar Association, which all have substantial lobbying budgets. 
The Iowa Academy of Trial Lawyers spent $25,000 on lobbying in 2025, though the group declared on more than 80 bills. The Iowa Association of Justice spent $98,625 in 2025 and registered on more than 230 bills in 2025. The Iowa State Bar Association spent $123,921 on lobbying efforts but registered on more than 240 bills this year. 
Spending by these groups did not perceptively increase following the introduction of the pesticide labeling bill.
Lobbyists on behalf of Bayer also registered on bills outside of the pesticide labeling file, with around 60 declarations in 2025.
Bayer and Modern Ag Alliance are also pushing for similar bill at the federal level and submitted a letter to Congress on the issue in May, urging lawmakers to take up a bill. The letter was signed by more than 350 agricultural interest groups.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)More than a year after Detroit smashed the attendance record for the NFL Draft, city officials are warning Michigan is at risk of falling behind other states in attracting similar major events.
That’s because other states – like Texas and Indiana – have dedicated funding models in place aimed at attracting high-level events, while Michigan does not.
Cities engage in a “cutthroat” bidding process to entice event sponsors to host their events there, including by offering economic incentives to help offset costs.
But since Michigan doesn’t have a dedicated source of funding for attracting major events, that leaves the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau – commonly known as Visit Detroit – and the Detroit Sports Commission mostly on their own to back the city’s bids.

Detroit’s successful bid to host the NFL Draft included about $15 million of economic incentives, Visit Detroit President Claude Molinari said during a panel discussion in May at the Detroit Regional Chamber’s annual Mackinac Policy Conference.
Visit Detroit put $2 million up front and got a match of an additional $2 million from the state. They then had to work to bridge the remaining $11 million gap on their own.
“So often, we say we’re afraid we won’t win the bid, and we’re terrified we will,” Molinari said. “It’s like, okay, how are we going to pay for this, and who’s out there that’s going to be willing to back us?”
When all was said and done, Molinari said, “open up your checkbook, because Visit Detroit’s going to have to put up another $1.5 million to carry the day.”
“It was worth it, but that’s not a sustainable model for Visit Detroit to do that,” Molinari said.
The economic incentives help defray costs associated with the massive footprint of major events, including renting parking lots to hold production trucks, hotel rooms and the event venues themselves. But it’s far from a free ride.
While Visit Detroit spent $15 million to attract the NFL Draft, Molinari estimates the NFL itself likely spent an additional $40 million putting on the event.
And the investment paid off, creating $200 million in direct economic impact to Southeast Michigan – $167 million of which came from at least 100 miles away.
“I’m not a Wall Street guy, but … I’ll invest $15 million to make $160 million any day,” Molinari said.
Detroit Sports Commission Executive Director Marty Dobek said Texas has the “gold standard model” for special event funding.
“It’s why every two cycles of the NCAA Final Four you’re going to see Dallas, Houston and San Antonio,” Dobek said.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)
Texas uses a reimbursement model that pays out by performance. Adapted for Michigan, Molinari said Visit Detroit would work with “friendly banks” to put the money up front.
If the budget called for booking 10,000 hotel room nights over the course of the event, and only 8,000 hotel room nights end up being booked, Visit Detroit would only get an 80% reimbursement. But if the event overperformed, booking 12,000 hotel room nights, they would still only get the 100% reimbursement.
“We would take the risk … but then we get a reimbursement on the back end, the state would be covered and we’d get these huge events,” Molinari said.
The fact that Texas has continued providing the funding to attract the events demonstrates its success, Molinari said.
“That’s a red state who is saying we’re going to put tax money behind these major events, because we see the ROI. It’s there,” Molinari said. “They keep doing it. If they were losing money on it, if it was a failure, they’d stop.”
Indiana takes a different approach, with an annual appropriation deposited to the state’s bid fund.
Their first two-year budget since creating the fund included a $10 million deposit, which the Indiana Sports Corp says resulted in more than $750 million of direct economic impact.
“It is promised, it’s predictable and it helps you plan for future events so that you can demonstrate to these rights holders who want to choose cities to come and bring their events,” Dobek said.
That allows Indianapolis to attract major events on a consistent basis, including a first-of-its-kind deal with WWE to bring WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble to Lucas Oil Stadium.
Detroit hosted SummerSlam, WWE’s second biggest annual event, in 2023.

But with no stable funding model in place for Michigan, Molinari said it can take five or more years before being able to successfully bid on additional major events.
“It’s like, do we want to host these events on a regular basis, or do we want to host these events occasionally,” Dobek said.
If Michigan were to create a statewide bid fund, it could be fueled by general fund appropriations or a dedicated source of revenue, like an entertainment tax modeled after the one charged in other nearby states.
The fund would be for the entire state, with tiered thresholds based on the size of the city; Traverse City, for example, would have a lower threshold than Detroit to access funding.
Plans already being made into the 2030s
Detroit is currently preparing to host the NCAA Final Four in early 2027.
NBC Sports Host Mike Tirico suggested having Michigan State University and the University of Michigan start their basketball season at Little Caesars Arena.
“Let’s start the season where it’s going to end: In Detroit,” Tirico said.
Beyond that, Visit Detroit and the Detroit Sports Commission are already looking as far ahead as 2033.
The NCAA is expected to open the bidding period this summer for a variety of major events – including the Sweet 16, Elite Eight, Frozen Four, Wrestling Championships and more – taking place through the late 2020s and early 2030s.
The city is also vying for an NBA All-Star Game, ideally in 2029 or 2030 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the “Bad Boys” winning consecutive NBA championships for the Detroit Pistons, as well as the 50th anniversary of the last time an NBA All-Star Game was held in Michigan, at the Pontiac Silverdome.
“We’re in that process, and we’ll see what happens, but we’re going to give it our best shot,” Pistons Sports and Entertainment Vice Chairman Arn Tellem said.
Another looming anniversary for Detroit is in 2027, which will mark 20 years since WrestleMania 23 at Ford Field and 40 years since WrestleMania 3 at the Pontiac Silverdome.
Asked during a press conference following the conclusion of SummerSlam at Ford Field in 2023 – which was itself taking place 30 years after SummerSlam was held at The Palace of Auburn Hills – whether another WrestleMania could be in Detroit’s near future, WWE COO Paul “Triple H” Levesque cited the bidding process, noting the economic impact the event had for other recent host cities.
“Their desire to have us here, it’s a part of that process,” Levesque said. “Of course, it’s not just about the benefits and about the money, it’s about where we’re going to have the best reaction, where our fans are the best. If we get offers for places where we don’t think we’re going to have a great show, we’re not going to go there.”
But the competitiveness of other states has raised the bar for everyone.
When Detroit hosted SummerSlam in 2023, the WWE was given about $500,000 of incentives. But Dobek said that price tag could now be as high as $7 million.
That’s in part because of a precedent set by Las Vegas – who will now host WrestleMania 42 in 2026 after hosting WWE’s flagship event this year, despite the company having already publicly announced New Orleans as the host city for next year’s event.
In addition to strong economic incentives, Las Vegas benefits from being a tourist destination. The combination has made them “as good a sports city as we ever could have imagined,” Tirico said, adding that the Las Vegas Raiders are forced to play using away game strategies even during home games because so many fans of other teams will travel to attend games at Allegiant Stadium.
While not as big of a city on its own, Indianapolis has also successfully created a culture around sports, Tirico said, noting that a lack of hotel space in downtown Detroit is another challenge in attracting major events and a major reason why a previous bid for the Final Four was unsuccessful.
“You want the Final Four where you can walk,” Tirico said. “That’s the Indianapolis magic.”
Local bars and restaurants in downtown Indianapolis benefit from and contribute to that culture by “adopting” different teams, he added.
Detroit’s sports culture in play
Detroit has made an effort to similarly establish itself as one of the country’s best cities for sports.
Even when it’s not hosting a major event, Tellem said Detroit is “the most unique sports city in America” because it’s the only city with all four major sports teams “in the heart of downtown,” creating “an energy and a walkability that no other city has.”
“Everyone in professional sports knows how unique this is in Detroit,” Tellem said.
Philadelphia also has all four sports teams within walking distance, but Tellem and Tirico agreed that those venues are not in the heart of the city.

Beyond physical proximity, Tellem said it is also unique that all four of Detroit’s professional sports teams work together rather than being locked in competition with one another.
Legendary Pistons player Grant Hill, a seven-time NBA All-Star who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018, said that’s one of sports’ biggest powers: Bringing people together.
“To see so many people – different ethnicities, I’m sure different political affiliations – all putting aside their differences and cheering for that red, white and blue – there’s a little bit of teal in there to us – but that’s what sports does,” Hill said. “It inspires, it entertains, but it brings people together.”
Hill backed Detroit’s successful bid to host a new WNBA team – another portion of the city’s efforts to establish itself as a major sports city – making him a minority owner of the currently unnamed team that will begin playing at Little Caesars Arena in 2029.
The bid was led by Pistons owner Tom Gores. Other investors include Eminem, Lions quarterback Jared Goff, former Pistons player Chris Webber, Lions owner Sheila Ford Hamp, Red Wings and Tigers owner Denise Ilitch and GM CEO Mary Barra.
The successful bid marks the return of the WNBA to Detroit after the city previously hosted a franchise from 1998 through 2009.
Indiana Fever player Sophie Cunningham reacted to the news, telling journalists “I don’t know how excited people are to be going to Detroit.”
The city leveraged its official social media accounts to respond, noting that the Detroit Shock ranked top five in attendance for five straight seasons – hitting number one in attendance for three of those seasons – and set a single-game attendance record of 22,076 fans during the 2003 WNBA Finals.
“Detroit is a sports town,” the city wrote in a post on X. “We’re sure we’ll see the same excitement for the WNBA returning.”
Former Detroit Shock player Swin Cash-Canal, a Hall of Fame member and four-time WNBA All-Star who helped lead the Shock to two of their three WNBA Championships in 2003 and 2006, said Detroit was instrumental in making the WNBA what it is today.
“When you see 21,000 packing out The Palace in Auburn Hills, which still actually holds the record in the WNBA for the most fans ever in a finals game… When you see your team having to move from Auburn Hills in another finals and then you’re in the Joe Louis and you’re packing that out and they’re trying to find standing room tickets, we always knew what the WNBA could be,” Cash-Canal said.
When the new team begins playing in 2029, it will be in yet another new venue, joining the Pistons and Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena.
But Tellem said recapturing the energy won’t be an issue.
Tellem said several of the “Bad Boys,” as well as members of the “Best Five Alive” who won the Pistons their third NBA Championship in 2004, were at Little Caesars Arena earlier this year for the Pistons’ playoffs games, including Isaiah Thomas, Chauncey Billups and Ben Wallace.
“They all talked about the feel of, this was finally the feel of The Palace in ’03 or ’04,” Tellem said. “And they were ready to play. They wanted to suit up. They said they finally had the goosebumps of competition again.”
In addition to the new venue, the WNBA team may have a new name.
While Cash-Canal said she can’t imagine the team being called anything other than the Shock, they may not be able to use the brand due to a competing league registering the rights to the name in 2023.
If the WNBA is unable to reach a deal to reclaim the name, Hill suggested the Detroit Spirit as an alternative, while Tellem suggested connecting with Motown’s musical history and naming the team the Supremes.
Beyond the direct economic impact, Molinari said hosting major events and being among the best sports cities also helps change people’s perceptions of the region, whether they’re coming downtown for the NFL Draft or are among the millions watching it on television.
That, in turn, also makes the city more attractive to other event sponsors.
“It’s like that virtuous circle effect, where the more success you have, the more success you’re going to have,” Molinari said.
But Molinari said it’s up to the state to decide whether to capitalize on Detroit’s current momentum.
“If the appetite is not to really commit to this level of competition, then we’ll kind of be more selective about what we do,” Molinari said. “But if it’s the collective belief that this is the kind of thing that’s really going to benefit the state of Michigan, then we have to lean in.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AMR_0014-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 18:57:01.621879

Gov. Phil Scott has denied a request from the Trump administration for a dozen members of the Vermont National Guard to assist U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The request from the federal government was made to several states, including Vermont, for National Guard personnel to provide support to ICE, according to the Vermont National Guard and a press release issued last week by the defense department.
The Vermont National Guard forwarded the request to Scott, who turned it down, according to Joseph Brooks, a Vermont National Guard public affairs officer.  
Vermont Public reported on the matter Wednesday.

Scott, speaking with reporters Thursday, confirmed he had rejected the request and provided additional details behind his decision.
In this case, the Republican governor said, the request from the administration of Republican President Donald Trump came under a provision of the law that allowed him to approve or reject it.
“There were 12 clerical positions that were being requested for the emergency, the executive order that he had for the southern border,” Scott said. 
The governor said he didn’t support having 12 Vermont National Guard members assigned for a year to do clerical work, particularly when those positions could be filled in other ways.

“I think about the thousands of federal workers furloughed, some fired, some just left on their own, but there’s literally tens of thousands of federal employees that would be available for this type of work,” Scott said. 
Had the request dealt with guard members needed for dealing with counterterrorism, “maybe cyber work,” or drug interdiction, the governor said, his response may have been different. 
“This one didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, especially because it appears they’re referencing an executive order for the southern border and its clerical positions,” Scott said.
The clerical positions, the governor said, would have been located at federal offices in St. Albans, which is home to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office. 
Scott said he rejected the request Wednesday. “I haven’t heard anything back,” he said Thursday. 
Brooks said Thursday that because the request was made under a provision known as Title 32, it was up to the governor to decide how to respond. 
“The governor has the say whether or not we do that mission,” Brooks said.
Since Trump assumed office in January, there have been several protests and demonstrations in Vermont in response to ICE’s ramped-up immigration enforcement actions, marking a shift from Biden administration policies.

The post Boston struggle[...]","AFTER OPENING A water bill last year, Ruth Solomon saw an advertisement for a novel program that sought to encourage Boston residents to build green roofs. 
The 51-year-old mom from Jamaica Plain had been intrigued by the benefits of such roofs, which act like sponges, using a range of plants to absorb stormwater and help reduce electricity costs by improving insulation. 
“We thought it would be a good thing to do,” she said. 
Last fall, Solomon and her husband, Rob Ditzion, were the first recipients of the new grants from the Boston Water and Sewer Commission, which they used to plant a range of succulents on a specially built roof over their mudroom. 
The couple received $8,000 — covering nearly 90 percent of their costs — from a pool of $650,000 the commission has set aside for individual grants to promote green roofs and other ways of reducing stormwater pollution in Boston. 
The commission’s goal is to reduce the runoff after storms carry contaminants from roads and other impervious surfaces into storm drains. That stormwater, long a source of pollution in Boston Harbor and other local waterways, can spur toxic algae blooms, fish die-offs, and other environmental damage. 
As climate change increases heavy bursts of precipitation in New England, the number of intense two-day storms rose by 74 percent between 1901 and 2016, while the heaviest downpours now dump 55 percent more precipitation than the most intense storms did during the middle of the 1900s, according to a 2023 report by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. The report added that an additional 40 percent increase in such heavy bursts of precipitation is projected by the end of the century. 
Green roofs can play a significant role in reducing such pollution in urban areas, said Lydia Olson, a technical specialist at the Massachusetts Rivers Alliance, an environmental advocacy group. 
She has urged local and state officials to do more to reduce the runoff, saying the benefits range from improving air quality to making the Charles River swimmable more regularly. 
“There is an urgent need for more funding for water infrastructure and stormwater mitigation across the state,” she said. 
As part of that effort, the commission last year changed how city residents pay their bills, breaking them down into separate charges for water, sewage, and stormwater. Money raised from the stormwater charge will be used to help repair or build new stormwater infrastructure, commission officials said. 
The commission also started a program that provides city residents who meet its stormwater retention standards with a 30 percent discount on the stormwater portion of their bill. 
Still, the Boston water commission has had a hard time persuading residents to take them up on their offer to help subsidize green roofs and other ways of reducing runoff. 
After launching the grant program last spring, there was only one other applicant. 
Judith Stoia, 78, received $2,130 to build a dry well on her property in Jamaica Plain. Dry wells are underground chambers that collect and store stormwater. 
To entice more residents, the commission last year doubled the amount of the grants to $8,000 per applicant, and since then, they have received another five applications. 
Anthony Dello Iacono, director of its stormwater program, said the commission had advertised the grants to customers through mailings and conversations with community groups. That hasn’t been sufficient to draw the number of applicants that the commission wants. 
“The commission would love to see more participants,” Iacono said. 
Commission officials said they didn’t know why more residents weren’t taking advantage of the grants. 
Nicole Holmes, who oversees sustainability projects at Nitsch Engineering in Boston, noted how increasingly intense storms and heavy bursts of rain, as a result of climate change, are making stormwater pollution more of a problem across the region. 
“In flood prone areas, green roofs could serve as a highly effective tool for mitigating flooding, allowing water to be stored on rooftops and slowly released once floodwaters have receded,” Holmes said. “I am hopeful the city of Boston will continue to strengthen policy and incentives for green roofs.” 
The commission’s grant program is one of several efforts to encourage the installation of green roofs in Boston. 
Last October, the city announced green roofs would be added to 30 bus stops along the MBTA’s 28 route. 
 Zöe Davis, a project manager in the city’s Office of Climate Resilience, said while the project aims to reduce stormwater runoff, it has the added benefit of providing commuters shade. 
 Davis said city officials are considering expanding the program to other bus routes. 
 “The desire is not only to expand this pilot, but to formalize it as a program and formalize climate readiness into the streets,” she said. 
 Green roofs have been more common in some European countries, such as Germany, where there are at least 2 billion square feet of green roofs, according to a report by Green Plants for Green Buildings, a Colorado-based environmental group. 
In the United States, there are now more than 17.5 million square feet of green roofs, according to American Forests, a Washington-based conservation group. Chicago alone now has 509 green roofs, amounting to more 5.6 million square feet, city officials say. 
 It’s unclear how many green roofs there are in Boston, but a study from Tufts University identified nearly 15,000 buildings in the city that may be suitable candidates for green roofs. 
 Mark Winterer, founder of Recover Green Roofs, a Somerville company that designs and installs green roofs, said Boston should consider emulating a Washington, DC, program that allows developers who store more stormwater on their properties to earn or trade credits to other developers who can’t meet the city’s stormwater requirements. 
 “It’s not forcing people to do it, but it’s creating an incentive of savings over time,” Winterer said. 
 As Solomon and Ditzion’s roof in Jamaica Plain this summer has sprouted sea pink flowers, the couple said they have no regrets. 
 They’ve had to spend $1,000 to have the company that installed the roof look after its irrigation and the health of the plants. Aside from that, they’ve just been enjoying the view — and compliments from their neighbors. 
 They haven’t seen any change in their utility bills, but they have noticed that their mudroom is cooler on warm days than it would have been without the green roof. They also think it has likely increased the value of their single-family colonial. 
 Solomon said she would encourage more city residents to consider applying for a grant. 
 “It helps the environment, and it looks cool,” she said. “It does so many good things. It just makes sense.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission meets Monday for a general discussion of state laws and research around the medicine.
The commission has until Oct. 1 to begin licensing medical cannabis establishments.
Monday’s meeting agenda doesn’t explain how close the commission is to releasing more permanent rules and regulations. Once those guidelines are released, commissioners would need to schedule a public hearing at least 30 days out. The agenda does include a section on general “rule updates,” as well as a plan to thank the public for various comments received by July 15 on the board’s temporary guidance for medical cannabis licensing. 
Formal regulations would replace the emergency regulations that are in effect through Sept. 28. They would need the approval of Gov. Jim Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers.

The temporary regulations can be extended for one 90-day period, if needed, though Pillen and the commission have said they would like to have formal guidelines in place by Oct. 1.
The emergency rules and regulations, including application requirements, are available here. 
Pillen approved the emergency regulations June 29, which immediately allowed the commission to begin accepting licensing applications for cultivators, product manufacturers, dispensaries and transporters. 
However, it remains unclear where applications are supposed to be submitted.
Under the emergency regulations, those wishing to obtain a license would be prohibited from selling raw plant material; any product to be administered by smoking, vaping or combustion; any product with artificial flavoring, natural flavoring or coloring; a food or drink that has cannabis backed, mixed or otherwise infused into it; any hemp-based product or products with “intoxicating cannabinoids,” including delta-8 and delta-10 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
Allowable products could consist of oral tablets, capsules, tinctures, non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, gelatinous rectangular cuboids, gels, oils, creams, suppositories, transdermal patches and liquids or oils to be used through a nebulizer or inhaler.
Among Monday’s agenda items is a discussion on “research on flavorings, effects of cannabis use during pregnancy and smoking.” 
Pillen has said that three of his appointments to the Medical Cannabis Commission agree with him that Nebraska should not move toward recreational marijuana. At least two of his appointees have said they do not support smoking marijuana as an acceptable medical use.
Commissioners also are scheduled to have a general discussion on the voter-approved laws around medical cannabis:

The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Patient Protection Act, approved by 71% of voters in November, legalized up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with any health care practitioner’s recommendation. The law is currently in effect.
The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Regulation Act, approved by about 67% of voters, created the Medical Cannabis Commission to regulate the medicine and begin licensing by Oct. 1.

Commissioners could also enter executive session Monday to discuss pending litigation, such as a lawsuit before the Nebraska Supreme Court seeking to invalidate the medical cannabis laws. A district court judge dismissed the case initially, though the Attorney General’s Office has already voiced intent to also sue the commission if and when it begins licensing.
The commission also now has a website, https://lcc.nebraska.gov/medical-cannabis, and email, mcc.contact@nebraska.gov.
Commissioners will also review the board’s operating budget and vote on whether to borrow funds from the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission for staff expenses. By law, three of the five medical cannabis commissioners come from the Liquor Control Commission. One of the group’s first purchases could be paying $108.68 for public meeting notices in the Omaha World-Herald and Lincoln Journal Star in June.
The use of such funds from the Liquor Control Commission remains murky. 
Those dollars are derived from registration fees, server training fees and sales from the selling of the Liquor Control Commission’s rules, governing laws and other publications. State law allows those funds to be used for “administrative costs” from specific liquor laws, not cannabis.
The Medical Cannabis Commission meets at 1 p.m. Monday in the Meadowlark Conference Room on the lower level of the State Office Building in Lincoln, 301 Centennial Mall South.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has agreed to ease the upfront cash required to sell Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to new owners — in exchange for increased state regulatory oversight of the local hospitals.
Revised transaction terms unveiled Thursday come as buyer The Centurion Foundation struggles to sell $165 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds to complete its purchase of the safety net hospitals from its bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings. 
The bond amount reflects the $80 million purchase price plus an $80 million cash injection into the struggling hospitals’ balance sheets — one of 85 conditions state regulators imposed in granting conditional approval of the sale in June 2024.
At the time, Neronha said the terms were non-negotiable. He then agreed to amend a few operational conditions in November. 
Forced back to the negotiating table a third time after an unexpected phone call from Centurion’s lawyers this month, Neronha agreed to let the Atlanta-based nonprofit complete the sale with $45 million cash on hand, rather than $80 million. But, there are more strings attached — 14 of them in all — aimed at ensuring the cash-strapped hospitals remain open and stable.
“We weren’t going to move unless they were going to true up that $80 million somehow,” Neronha told reporters at a press conference at his downtown Providence office. “I am not going to make a weak deal weaker without some assurances.”
The 200-page revised agreement ensures the hospitals will have enough cash to sustain operations for at least the next 18 to 24 months, offering a chance at salvation after they were decimated by their former, private equity owners. If Centurion can’t complete the turnaround as prescribed, enhanced reporting and oversight requirements ensure Neronha’s office will be ready to petition for financial receivership before a local bankruptcy judge.
“I wanted to make sure if I saw things going the wrong way out there, I would be able to step in and take over,” Neronha said. “We won’t be in bankruptcy court in Dallas. That is a huge step forward.”
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, praised the newly negotiated agreement in an emailed statement.
“This is an important step forward as we move through the bond and financing process and finalize the sale to help secure the future of these essential hospitals and 2,400 employees,” Brown said.
Brown did not respond to questions regarding how much money Centurion still needs to raise, or when the deal will close. Neronha was unsure, but was hopeful the bond sale would close as expected at the end of August.
Countdown begins
Once the deal closes, Centurion will have 90 days to come up with the remaining $35 million in cash to fulfill the AG’s original condition of an $80 million injection — likely through a federal financing program that offers low, fixed-interest rate loans for energy efficiency and other property upgrades. 
Despite its initial cash flow woes, Neronha said he was confident Centurion could fulfill the outstanding financial obligations required.
“They have given me assurances in writing, and they are assurances that can be relied on, in my judgment,” he said.
More reliable, at least, than letting a federal bankruptcy judge decide the fate of the local hospitals. Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Dallas in January, confirming suspicions of its worsening financial plight as its other hospitals across the country shuttered and lawsuits over unpaid bills piled up.










They have given me assurances in writing, and they are assurances that can be relied on, in my judgment. 


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha on Centurion’s outstanding financial obligations


Neronha has long criticized the LA-based hospital chain operator and its former majority stakeholder, private equity firm Leonard Green, for draining hospitals to boost its own balance sheet.
“One of my reasons for approving the transaction in the first place was just to get them away from Prospect,” he said. 
The two hospitals, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
Neronha’s office took Prospect to court in 2023 to ensure vendors in Rhode Island were paid on time. Since the federal bankruptcy filing in Texas, his office has been carefully watching and attending Dallas court proceedings, securing the judge’s approval to proceed with the pending sale of Roger Williams and Fatima.
Proponents of the sale say Centurion offers a way to reestablish local control and return to nonprofit ownership. 
But the Atlanta-based nonprofit has never run a hospital before, and its lack of experience proved a sticking point. Credit ratings agencies highlighted “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s pending bonds in ratings assessments earlier this year.
The union representing 1,200 employees who work for the hospital system has protested the sale for years with similar arguments.

Band-Aid or a cure?
Lynn Blais, a nurse at Fatima and president of the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, doubts Centurion can save her workplace — a belief reinforced by its inability to sell the bonds for the deal.
“This business model isn’t going to work,” she said in an interview after the press conference ended. “I don’t know how it isn’t going to fail with the current state of how things are in health care.”
Neronha wasn’t making promises, either.
“I can’t stand here and tell Rhode Islanders or the workers or the providers that these hospitals will be thriving and robust 18 months from now, six months from now,” he said. “I don’t know that.”
But, the new protections added to the sale agreement offer temporary peace of mind — preserving jobs, treating patients, and fast-tracking much-needed capital improvements like a new roof.
The updated agreement now requires Centurion to spend $50 million from a dedicated escrow fund on hospital capital expenditures within the first three years of its ownership. The hospitals have fallen into disrepair under Prospect’s ownership, including equipment shortages, federal safety violations and neglected infrastructure upgrades. 
“Tonight, when it rains, it will be raining inside the building,” Blais said. “On the fourth floor at Fatima, we’ll have buckets out.”
Blais also described inadequate air conditioning on hot days, and a broken main elevator as overdue repairs. 
“For him to designate this money for the infrastructure is so important,” she said. “If this deal falls apart in 18 months, if we invest in the infrastructure, at least our property values will still be there.”



Key updates to hospital sale agreement
 Among the conditions included in the Fatima, Roger Williams sale agreement:

Monthly reports submitted to state regulators, including the AG and Rhode Island Department of Health, showing cash on hand and a 13-week financial forecast. Additional notices and protections are triggered if Centurion does not have enough cash to cover at least 40 days of operating expenses, including, if cash on hand is less than 30 days, giving the AG’s office nonvoting representation on its board of directors.
A turnaround consultant hired at least 10 days prior to the sale closing. (previously the turnaround consultant could be hired after the deal was completed).
Intensive fiduciary training within the first quarter of operations, with training materials and instructors vetted by the AG’s office.
If Centurion or its subsidiary files for bankruptcy or becomes financially insolvent, the owners cannot object to the AG’s petition for a court-appointed receiver to take over hospital finances and operations.

The annual tax holiday in Iowa is applicable to clothing items — specifically “any article of wearing apparel and typical footwear intended to be worn on or about the human body.”
Any individual clothing item under $100 that fits this definition, with several exceptions, purchased after 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 1 until midnight on Aug. 2, will be free of Iowa’s 7% state sales tax.

All businesses open during that time are required to participate.
“It’s a very popular program because people can save money,” said John Fuller, public information officer for the Iowa Department of Revenue. “Several states do something similar to what Iowa does.”
The tax relief program began in 2000 and was spearheaded by former state Rep. Mike Cormack, a Republican legislator from Fort Dodge.
However, critics at Institution on Taxation and Economic Policy argue this method is an inefficient vehicle for providing tax relief or generating substantial economic activity while providing “significant downsides.” 
“Sales tax holidays are ineffective and gimmicky,” said Miles Trinidad, ITEP state analyst, in a press release. “While policymakers often tout them as helping families save money for essential goods, these holidays fall far short of lessening the regressive nature of sales taxes on the low and moderate income households who feel these taxes the most while also depriving states of revenue, being easily exploitable, and creating administrative headaches.”
ITEP estimates the amount of lost revenue for 2025 will be equal to $1.3 billion across states and localities. They argue this will “ultimately have to be made up elsewhere either through painful spending cuts or increasing other taxes.” 
Critics at The Tax Foundation argued in a press release that sales tax holidays:

Do not “promote significant economic growth or increase consumer spending” but rather shifts the timing of regular purchases.
Are not an efficient response to inflation that encourages spending during a limited timeframe when supply chains “are already strained.”
“Create complexities for tax code compliance, efficient labor allocation and inventory management.”
Are not effective in providing tax relief to lower-income individuals because they give “large savings to higher-income groups as well.”

The Tax Foundation also argues that the popularity of these holidays is in part due to corporate lobbying to secure “free advertising for what is effectively a 4 to 7 percent discount.”
They added these holidays create a space for politicians to “pick political favorites in the process of selecting eligible products” and the narrow list of goods can become an “unholy matrimony of central economic planning and corporate lobbying.”
Currently, 19 states have or will hold tax holidays.
States like Oklahoma and West Virginia also exempt clothing items during their state’s tax holiday whereas states like Massachusetts, Nevada and Alaska are less restrictive in what types of products are eligible.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.A corporate landlord with several apartment buildings in the Twin Cities must pay tenants more than $5 million after charging exorbitant utility fees at most of its properties, which led to eviction actions against at least 21 residents.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Investment Property Group in 2023 over the illegal utility bills, which impacted at least 4,000 households. The two parties settled on Wednesday, with Investment Property Group agreeing to pay $1.8 million to tenants harmed by the illegal utility bills, and $350 in rent credits to all tenants at certain properties.
Investment Property Group will also forgive tenants’ rent and utility debt.
“I am pleased my office was able to stop illegal practices harming tenants and will be able to put hard-earned money back in tenants’ pockets,” Ellison said in a press release. 
Landlords for buildings with a single utility meter — rather than one per unit — can charge residents for a portion of the building’s utility usage, as long as they follow certain disclosure requirements. For instance, the landlord must give prospective tenants an estimate of their utility costs before they sign a lease.
Investment Property Group did not follow those disclosure requirements, and in many cases, started charging tenants hundreds of dollars in utility bills and fees in the middle of their leases, according to the attorney general’s office.
The attorney general’s office also alleges that Investment Property Group illegally withheld tenants’ security deposits.
Separately, tenants in two of Investment Property Group’s buildings demonstrated over unjustified charges, security issues and a failure to complete repairs, clean common areas and respond to noise complaints. Tenants at those two buildings were not included in the lawsuit and are ineligible for restitution.

The department did not provide additional data or information in its news release announcing the stat, nor did it respond to a request from the Phoenix for additional information.
Combining this year’s calculation with last year’s, vacancies are down nearly 30% over the last two years, according to the department. Two years ago, the department reported 4,776 vacancies statewide. 
“Florida continues to attract the best teaching talent because we have raised teacher pay, empowered our teachers in the classroom and created new pathways for Floridians to enter the teaching profession,” Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas said in a news release. 
The department credits a focus on increasing teacher salaries, a statistic the Sunshine State ranks last in nationwide, and the state’s teacher apprenticeship program for its reported decrease in vacancies.
The department calls out “other sources” that “attempt to use inaccurate data from third-party sources to inflate teacher vacancy data.”
Last year, the department and the Florida Education Association disagreed on vacancy data, standing about 900 vacancies apart from each other. The FEA estimated more vacancies than the state.
The union said it gathers its data by counting advertised vacancies on school district websites. The department said it gathers its data directly from districts.
The FEA has not released its data for the coming year. It told the Phoenix its report will be released in the coming weeks.

 Idaho U.S. Sen. Crapo praises Adams. But ranking Democrat is skeptical 

Ahead of the vote, Crapo gave his support for Adams. 
“Dr. Adams spoke strongly about his belief that federal policy should strengthen rather than supplant parents’ capacity to make the best decisions for their children,” Crapo said. “As the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Dr. Adams knows what policy decisions empower states to provide critical assistance to some of America’s most vulnerable populations. I’m confident in his ability to lead the array of programs under the Administration for Children and Families at HHS.” 
The committee’s ranking Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, spoke more skeptically of Adams’ work at the helm of Idaho’s health agency. 
“Initially, I thought that Dr. Adams was someone who could really make a big difference,” Wyden said. “But what I found, both as we looked into his record and some questioning at the committee, he talks an encouraging game with respect to safety and helping families but his record shows something very different. 
The Oregon senator cited Adams’ decision last year to end a program that allowed Idaho parents to serve as paid caregivers for their children with disabilities. Adams said at the time that fraud and abuse drove up costs to run the program, the Sun reported, while parents and disability advocates expressed deep concerns that the decision would leave children without care amid Idaho’s shortage of direct care workers. 
Wyden also referenced an Idaho law passed this year that loosens regulations of child care facilities, including lowering required child-to-staff ratios. 
The senator said Adams “bobbed and weaved” as committee members asked various questions or pressed him on whether he agreed with the changes made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
  Adams nomination backed by Idaho governor, dozens of groups

Adams’ nomination received letters of support from Idaho Gov. Brad Little and more than 24 organizations, state agencies, and Native American tribes in Idaho. Some of the groups who wrote in support include the Idaho State Department of Education, the Idaho Commission on Aging, Virginia Gov. Janet Vestal Kelly, Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein, and the American Public Human Services Association. 
Adams has continued to serve as chief of Idaho Health and Welfare during the nomination process, but on Thursday the governor’s office announced Little appointed Juliet Charron to lead the agency starting in September, the Sun reported. Charron is deputy director of Medicaid within the agency.

Bill Mercer, R-Billings, speaks during a floor session of the House on Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)Bill Mercer, a Republican state lawmaker from Billings, sat for his nomination hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee this week, the next step towards taking a seat as a U.S. District Court Judge in Montana. 
Montana’s senior U.S. Sen. Steve Daines introduced Mercer to the committee on Wednesday, detailing his history of working at the state and federal level and expressing staunch support for President Donald Trump’s nominee. 
“Throughout his extensive legal career and years of public service, Bill has represented Montana’s interests well. He is committed to the rule of law and original interpretation of the Constitution,” Daines said in his remarks. “Bill understands Montana-specific laws and issues. His experience as a widely-respected and effective member of the Montana House of Representatives brings him in tune with the needs of our state, our families and our communities. I believe his time in Helena has given him an important additional perspective on the law and the importance of judicial impartiality.”
The judicial committee heard from four nominees to federal courts — Mercer, a U.S. District Court of Kentucky nominee, and picks for the First and Ninth circuit courts of appeals.  
During roughly 30 minutes, Mercer fielded questions from members of the committee, with Democrats pushing Mercer on the prosecution of Jan. 6 defendants; previous U.S. Supreme Court precedents and his work in the Montana Legislature. 
Ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, focused on votes taken by Mercer during the 2019 Legislature against a bill that would have eliminated a three-year statute of limitations for civil lawsuits by child sex abuse victims.
Mercer pushed back on Durbin’s characterization of his opposition and the law, which ultimately passed the Legislature after some compromise, with Mercer as a co-sponsor. The law raised the statute of limitation for victims to file a suit from three years to the age of 27, which Mercer said was done based on how similar legislation in other states was worded.  
“The key thing in that legislation that we did was create a much more robust reporting mechanism that allows us to have clarity, or rather, allows the Attorney General of the State to have clarity through the county attorneys on matters being referred for investigation,” Mercer said. “We thought it was very important legislation, and we’re pleased with the outcome.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, asked Mercer how he viewed several court precedents including Brown vs. Board of Education, Loving vs. Virginia and Obergefell vs. Hodges. 
Mercer stated that he believed Brown and Loving were correctly decided, but then specified that for Obergefell, “that’s binding precedent that the Supreme Court has issued. And if I had that matter come before me, I would adhere to that binding precedent.”
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, asked about Mercer’s expectations that parties to lawsuits follow court orders he issued. Under the latest Trump administration, there have been instances of federal officials failing to comply with court orders. 
“I think there are extremely narrow circumstances where there may be a basis to say that there is a legal basis not to follow the order. It’s extremely rare. I’ve never seen it,” Mercer said. “I’ve never counseled a party for whom I’m representing to take that position, and it would be my position, if confirmed that it’d be my expectation that all parties, regardless of who they represent, comply with any orders that I issue.”

The president nominated Mercer for a seat on the federal bench in Montana earlier this month, where two sitting judges have announced their retirement to senior status, but are awaiting new appointments.
“Bill has TREMENDOUS experience, previously serving at the Department of Justice and, as United States Attorney for the District of Montana,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. “He is STRONG and SMART, will fearlessly uphold the Rule of Law, and defend our Constitution on the Federal Bench.”
Mercer has been a lawyer in the state for more than three decades, and has argued cases before the Montana Supreme Court and federal appeals courts. 
In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Mercer as U.S. Attorney for the District of Montana, a position he held until 2009. He also served as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General and Acting Associate Attorney General during the Bush administration. 
Concurrently holding positions within the Department of Justice drew criticism from Montana’s federal delegation at the time for potentially violating federal laws requiring a U.S. Attorney to fully reside within the state they oversee, and then working to change the laws. 
Former Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, had called for Mercer to resign as U.S. Attorney, after it was reported that Mercer and other senior Bush administration aides pushed legislation to change residency requirements. Former Montana Sen. Max Baucus, also a Democrat, had asked Mercer to pick one of his two positions.  
Since 2019, Mercer has served four terms in the Montana House of Representatives, During the 2025 session, Mercer carried 25 bills the governor signed into law. Much of his legislation the past session focused on medical issues, as well as protections for children and elderly adults.
Gov. Greg Gianforte praised Mercer’s nomination in a statement yesterday. 
“With Bill’s distinguished legal career and his life-long commitment to public service, I’m proud to support his nomination. Given his experience in the Montana House of Representatives, I have faith that Bill will serve Montana well and apply the Constitution as our Founders intended,” Gianforte said. “I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him to serve Montana in this new capacity.”  
Mercer’s nomination has also drawn messages of support from Montana lawmakers on the other side of the aisle, with Missoula Democratic Sen. Ellie Boldman writing on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, “Bill is a respected professional & exceptionally qualified … I enthusiastically support his nomination for fed’l bench.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3459-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 17:56:57.168973
,DC,2025-07-31 21:21:31+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal appeals court skeptical of cases for and against Trump tariff authority,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-skeptical-cases-and-against-trump-tariff-authority,,"WASHINGTON — Judges on the U.S. Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit questioned the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping emergency tariffs Thursday as the White House pushes on with its Aug. 1 deadline for import taxes at levels not seen since the 1930s.The case originated from consolidated lawsuits brought by a handful of business owners and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general who argued the president does not have the authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.Through nearly two hours of questioning Thursday, the 11-judge panel probed whether the president could use IEEPA authority to set tariffs without approval from Congress.The U.S. Department of Justice’s Brett Shumate argued the law is “one of the most powerful tools” to protect the economy and national security during emergencies.Oregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of the Democratic states challenging the tariffs, maintained Trump’s reason behind declaring the unilateral emergency tariffs — U.S. trade deficits with other nations — did not actually merit a national emergency.Trump became the first president to trigger tariffs under the 1977 law when in February and March he ordered punitive import taxes on products from Canada, Mexico and China after declaring illegal fentanyl smuggling from those countries a national emergency.The president took his tariffs worldwide in an April executive order that declared trade deficits an emergency and slapped what he described as “reciprocal” import taxes on nearly all foreign goods.In late May, the U.S. Court of International Trade sided with Democratic attorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon, as well as the business owners from across the country, including in New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.The word ‘tariff’Judges on the panel grilled Shumate about how IEEPA grants the authority to impose tariffs.“A major concern that I have is IEEPA doesn’t even mention the word tariffs,” said Judge Jimmie V. Reyna, adding that Congress “certainly was aware about tariffs” when it wrote the law.Existing laws already create “a highly structured … framework” for tariffs, said Reyna, who was appointed to the bench in 2011 by President Barack Obama. “You would agree with me that those statutes do pertain to tariffs?”“Correct,” replied Shumate, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Division.Pressed again by Reyna on “tariff” not appearing in the statute, Shumate said “I don’t think that’s unusual.”“There are at least two examples of statutes that authorize tariffs that don't use the word ‘tariff’ — Sections 232c and 122, which authorize the president to restrict imports,” Shumate said.Judge Leonard P. Stark, who was appointed in 2022 by President Joe Biden, jumped in with skepticism.“Both of those are part of the code that deals expressly with customs and duties, unlike IEEPA, which is not in that chapter,” Stark said.Dependence on deficits probedThe panel also quizzed legal counsel for the businesses and states, including on the weight and content of Trump’s emergency declaration that launched his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs.The states ignored arguments in Trump’s executive order that an emergency existed because of a hollow manufacturing base, a threat to national security, supply-chain disruptions and other issues, Judge Richard G. Taranto said to Gutman, of Oregon.“Your arguments in your brief to us are devoted to the more narrow question of trade deficits alone as not amounting to unusual and extraordinary threat,” Taranto, who was appointed by Obama in 2013, said.Gutman replied that all other matters the order cites are related to trade deficits.“You can look at the executive order itself, the justification, the unusual and extraordinary threat that it is identifying, is what it calls persistent trade deficits,” he said. “Everything else that's discussed there is either mentioned as a cause or an effect.”Stark followed up with, “Is that the only fair reading of the executive orders, though? Can it be read as there are some recent consequences, some recent effects of the long and persistent trade deficit that now are unusual and extraordinary?”Gutman said those effects are mentioned “in about a sentence in the executive order.”Chief Judge Kimberly A. Moore fact-checked that answer.The executive order “goes on for paragraph after paragraph,” Moore said, mentioning production capacity, military equipment, national security concerns and other threats to the U.S. economy, she said.“How could you stand here and say to me that the president said it's all about the deficit, and it's one throwaway sentence at most in this whole order about the rest of these things constituting a threat?” Moore, who was appointed by George W. Bush, asked.After back and forth, Gutman said, “I will walk back that it was a single sentence. But I think if you read this, the fairest reading of this executive order is that it is about the large and persistent trade deficits.”Debate continuesOregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said after oral arguments the U.S. Department of Justice had a “monster flop” during the arguments when at one point Shumate told Moore that the court did not have authority to review the tariffs.“I think for those in the audience today, they are concerned when the federal government comes in and says that (judges) have absolutely no role to review what the president does under IEEPA. You actually heard laughter in the room,” Rayfield said.During the White House daily briefing following the arguments, press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended tariffs as a success, citing that the duties have raised $150 billion in revenue since Trump took office.“Those revenues will skyrocket even further, starting tomorrow, when new reciprocal tariff rates take effect,” Leavitt said.Tariffs are paid to the U.S. government by American businesses and individuals who purchase foreign goods.Critics across the spectrumThe case against Trump’s sweeping emergency tariffs has attracted support from various points on the political spectrum.Democratic members of Congress filed an amicus brief on behalf of the state attorneys general and small businesses arguing the president’s import taxes under IEEPA usurped Congress’ tariff powers and violated the Constitution.Congress has “explicitly and specifically” delegated tariff-raising powers to the president, but not under IEEPA, according to the lawmakers.“Unmoored from the structural safeguards Congress built into actual tariff statutes, the President’s unlawful ‘emergency’ tariffs under IEEPA have led to chaos and uncertainty,” the lawmakers wrote.The libertarian CATO Institute also filed an amicus brief raising several issues with Trump’s emergency tariffs, including that IEEPA contains “no textual support for tariff authority” and that it violates tariff power granted to Congress in the Constitution.Brent Skorup, legal fellow at the CATO Institute, said it’s hard to predict the outcome of the case and whether a longstanding judicial branch deference to the executive branch will “win out” over a recent trend of skepticism of the president’s plans.“In some ways I think this case has many analogies to President Biden’s attempt to forgive student loans,” he said in an interview with States Newsroom. “I mean, almost an identical issue — a vague statute, a president using it in a way that had never been used before for an economically major event.”U.S. consumers bear costsEconomists are cautioning that the costs of the tariffs will fall on the shoulders of U.S. consumers.The Yale Budget Lab’s most recent estimate shows the overall average effective tariff rate is 18.4%, the highest since 1933. The analysis, released Wednesday, included Trump’s latest trade announcement that he will impose a 25% duty on goods from India.The overall price level and distributional effects of the tariffs are projected to cost American households roughly $2,400 in 2025 dollars, Budget Lab projected.The analysis shows tariffs are expected to disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with the prices of shoes increasing by 40% in the short run.The Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank that advocates for lower taxes, found that Trump’s Aug. 1 tariff regime will affect nearly 75% of imported foods, with products from the European Union seeing the worst of it.The five food imports that would be most affected, barring any deal changes, include liqueurs and spirits, baked goods, coffee, fish and beer, according to the foundation’s July 28 review.Economists and some lawmakers also warn that Trump’s constantly evolving tariff policy is perpetuating an air of uncertainty for businesses. Sameera Fazili, the deputy director of the National Economic Council during the Biden administration, said the rapid changes are “undermining our economy.”“You can see it in CEO surveys, where the Conference Board CEO Sentiment Survey for Q2 reported that a quarter of CEOs now plan to cut back on capital investments,” Fazili, now a senior fellow at the liberal think tank the Roosevelt Institute, said Tuesday during a press call organized by the Economic Speakers Bureau.The same can be said for mid-sized and small businesses, said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.“When I go home, I've yet to come across a businessman or -woman who says, ‘Oh, I love the tariffs.’ It's the opposite,” Paul said at an event Wednesday at the CATO Institute.Of the court case, Paul said he thinks the administration is “going to lose.”“I think there's a constitutional reason against it,” he said. “And I think there's, in addition, a statutory reason they may fail.”",,,,2025-07-31 17:56:57.168973

He is suing to block a bill passed in a June special session that would finance stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals (photo by Madeline Carter).The bill authorizing state support for professional sports stadiums is unconstitutional because it grants public aid to private interests and combines widely different and unrelated subjects, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday by two state lawmakers.
State Sen. Mile Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Bryant Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, filed the case in Cole County Circuit Court. They were joined as plaintiffs by Ron Calzone, a long-time activist who has successfully challenged past legislation on constitutional grounds.
During a special session in June, lawmakers passed the bill to provide up to $1.5 billion in state tax funds to back bonds that would finance new construction or stadium improvements for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals. Gov. Mike Kehoe pushed for the bill to counter moves from Kansas intended to lure one or both teams across the state line.
Moon objected to the bill as unconstitutional when it was passed and said in an interview Thursday that getting court guidance over what can and cannot be in a single bill is an important goal of the lawsuit.
The Constitution “kind of gives us our marching orders for legislators and how we pass bills and what they should look like,” Moon said. “Can you amend the bill beyond a certain point? I’ve come to realize it seems like we have veered way off the road.”
Kehoe let his ambition to retain the Chiefs and Royals cloud his constitutional judgment, Moon said.
“This was a pretty big deal for the governor,” Moon said. “I’m not knocking the governor, but yet he was a legislator at one time, and he should know the bounds that we are governed by.”
In the bill, stadium construction would be financed by diverting tax money from economic activity surrounding the teams — sales tax on tickets, merchandise and food, income tax from player and team staff salaries — to repay bonds.
The bill also included provisions to:

Cap increases in property tax bills in most counties of the state. There are 75 counties where basic tax bills would not increase more than 5% per year or the rate of inflation, whichever is greater, and 22 where no increase would be allowed.
Extend a tax credit for amateur sporting events.
Provide a tax credit for damage from natural disasters this year to help property owners recover losses not met by insurance or other payments.
Require the courts to preserve any portions of the bill found constitutional by severing them from unconstitutional portions.

The lawsuit seeks to toss the bill in its entirety, alleging that it violates requirements that bills be limited to a single subject with a title that “clearly” states its purpose. The petition also alleges the bill was amended to go beyond its original purpose and that the property tax provisions are “special laws” forbidden by the constitution. 
“The stadium provisions subsidize business enterprises; the tax credits for disaster relief and for property tax relief subsidize homeowners,” attorneys W. Bevis Schock and Erich Vieth wrote in the lawsuit for Moon and Wolfin. “The former showers beneficence on billionaires; the latter showers the beneficence on all homeowners. The former will likely produce political contributions in vast sums from those able to make such contributions; the latter will likely produce political benefit but likely no political contributions.”
The title of the bill, relating to taxation, is so vague as to be meaningless, the attorneys wrote.
“The bill’s procedural infirmities,” they wrote, “mean it is not severable and fails in its entirety.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AG6J0158-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 17:56:57.168973

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Thousands of South Dakotans have been publicly labeled as applicants for government assistance and thousands more have had their email address and phone number exposed, due to a new state law and the way the state’s election office is implementing it.
Although the legislation creating the law received some Democratic votes, it’s a product of the Republican-dominated Legislature. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed it into law and Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson is carrying out its provisions. 
Several legislators, both Democrats and Republicans, are now telling South Dakota Searchlight they did not intend for the law to expose sensitive information — especially the identity of public assistance applicants.
“This is what happens when you put the wrong people in charge,” said state House Minority Leader Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, who voted against the bill. “We talk a lot about freedom and privacy in this state, so it’s a shame that this legislation led to this type of breach.”
About the new law
The legislation passed in March. It requires the Secretary of State’s Office — which oversees elections — to make the state’s entire voter registration list freely available online, after the list was previously available only for a $2,500 fee. 
Activists who favor the hand-counting of ballots, oppose the use of vote-counting machines and deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election were among those who promoted the legislation as an “election integrity” measure.
When the law took effect July 1, the Secretary of State’s Office made the statewide voter registration list freely available on its website, containing information about 668,419 registered voters.

The category includes public assistance applicants, among other methods of voter registration. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)

South Dakota Searchlight downloaded the list and found it included information such as each voter’s name, political party and address. It additionally included phone numbers and email addresses, if voters provided those two pieces of optional information while filling out their voter registration form, or if the information was automatically included when voters registered through another government form, such as an application for a driver’s license.
There was also a column identifying where and how voters registered, such as at a driver’s exam station, a disability services office, a military recruitment center, or while applying for assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or the Women, Infants and Children program.
In all, 7,186 people were labeled as having registered to vote while applying for some form of public assistance, according to a Searchlight analysis.
Past practice called into question
After the initial publication, the Secretary of State’s Office updated and replaced the older version of the spreadsheet. The newer version no longer includes columns devoted to how a voter registered, but the information still appears under the “County” column for some voters.
A spokesperson for the office told South Dakota Searchlight in an emailed statement that the free spreadsheet contains the same information that was “traditionally” available by paying the $2,500 fee. The office has not responded to further questions from Searchlight.

The South Dakota Democratic Party regularly purchased the information in the past. Executive Director Dan Ahlers, a former legislator, said past spreadsheets did not identify voters as having registered while applying for public assistance.
“I think the trust between South Dakotans and the state government has certainly been damaged here,” Ahlers said. “I think leadership has to answer for it. This is something the secretary of state will need to answer to the Legislature about: why this happened and how it can be avoided.”
Former secretary of state and current Public Utilities Commissioner Chris Nelson, a Republican, said lists compiled by his staff while he was secretary of state from 2003 through 2010 did not disclose how voters registered.
“It wasn’t a data item where you could go through a whole list and sort voters by how they registered to vote,” Nelson said.
Possible lawsuit predicted
Samantha Chapman, advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, said the release of confidential information could open the state up to a lawsuit.
She said the state is essentially forcing public assistance applicants to avoid registering to vote if they want their application to remain private.


“But those who register to vote now have to consent to having that information open to the public,” Chapman said.
The National Voter Registration Act requires public assistance agencies to facilitate voter registration, and to relay that voter information to county auditors and the Secretary of State’s Office. But multiple federal laws protect the confidentiality of individual public assistance records. 
Additionally, a state law says any record concerning an applicant or recipient of public assistance through the Department of Social Services is confidential. There are exceptions for “inspection by any person duly authorized by this state or the United States in connection with the person’s official duties,” and “for the purpose of fair hearings as provided by law.” 
When asking public assistance applicants if they’d like to register to vote, the state Department of Social Services economic assistance application says “information regarding the office to which the voter registration form was submitted will remain confidential and be used only for voter registration purposes.”
In response to Searchlight questions about the legality of the state’s actions, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said he is appointing lawyers from his office to discuss the matter with the Secretary of State’s Office.
The ACLU of South Dakota sent a letter Thursday to the Secretary of State’s Office asking it to:

Remove copies of the statewide voter registration file from its website.
Remove from the file all data about the method by which a person registered to vote.
Notify all South Dakota registered voters whose confidential information was exposed.
Update language on its website clarifying what registration information is public and clarifying that voter registrations completed through a public assistance office will remain confidential.

Rapid City Republican Rep. Heather Baxter was the main sponsor of the legislation requiring free publication of the voter registration list. She said this week it wasn’t her intention to publicize how voters registered. She only wanted information necessary to verify South Dakota’s voter rolls and to contact voters about their registration’s accuracy.
The bill’s lead Senate sponsor, Rapid City Republican John Carley, expressed similar motivations.
“All the bill did was make the voter registration file available at no cost to the public,” Carley said. “The source information wasn’t included in the voter registration file before this law and it shouldn’t be there after.”
Legislators are all included in the spreadsheet, because they have to be registered to run for office. That means their address — and their phone number and email address, for those who provided them — are available to the public, even though legislative leaders removed lawmakers’ addresses from the legislative website last month. The decision was motivated by safety concerns after the shootings of two legislators and their spouses at their homes in Minnesota.
Complaints extend to list’s accessibility, impact on campaigns
Carley is also upset with the Secretary of State’s Office for the way it’s publishing the list. The office initially posted it as a simple download link. Since then, the office has added an online form that has to be filled out first. After filling out the form — which requires information including a name, address, phone number and email — the website auto-generates an email containing download links.
Carley said the form hinders transparency and invades privacy. 
“This is public information the taxpayer is paying for, so there shouldn’t be a mechanism to track individuals,” he said.
Lincoln County Auditor Sheri Lund said privacy concerns are causing more people to submit new voter registration forms without the optional phone number and email address, so that those pieces of information won’t be publicly available.

Lund has been informing voters about the matter since lawmakers passed the bill in March.
“I think people are concerned about it and don’t know what the benefit of doing it was,” Lund said. “I don’t understand. There is no control over whoever is downloading that information.”
Lund said she’s not opposed to the information being available at no cost, but she’d rather have the request go to county auditors and “not be available for anybody to go through online.”
Campaigns are the typical users of the phone numbers and email addresses, Lund said, but she expects that to become more difficult as more voters file new forms to retract the information.
“It’s going to be harder for people running for positions to talk to voters if they want to call or text,” Lund said. “Otherwise, they’ll just reference the list for mailing information. There’ll be more mailers, so the post office should be happy.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/591A2875-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 17:56:57.168973

Ron DeSantis’ order, will be “Hulk Hogan Day in Florida” and flags will fly at half staff to honor pro wrestler and Florida resident Hulk Hogan, who died last week from a heart attack at his home in Clearwater Beach.
The wrestler spent much of his life in Florida and appeared with DeSantis recently and at the Republican National Convention last year in Milwaukee, endorsing Donald Trump. 
Hogan, born Terry Bollea, started wrestling in 1977 and eventually became a two-time WWE hall of famer. He was banned from WWE from 2015-2018 after it was discovered that he used racial slurs.
The 71-year-old owned Hogan’s Hangout in Clearwater Beach, among other ventures such as Real American Beer.
DeSantis ordered U.S. and state flags to fly at half-staff Friday in Tallahassee and Pinellas County. 
“We were with him just a couple months ago, my kids got to meet him and everything. So I was really sad to see that, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and people throughout this region of Florida, because I know so many people cared about him,” DeSantis said last week at a news conference in Bradenton.
Hogan received $115 million from a 2013 lawsuit in which he sued Gawker Media after the outlet published parts of a sex tape of Hogan and Heather Clem, former wife of Bubba the Love Sponge, a Florida radio personality. 
The damages bankrupted Gawker. Tech billionaire Peter Thiel financed the litigation on Hogan’s behalf. Earlier, a Gawker-affiliated website had outed Thiel as gay.

This mosquito is a known West Nile Virus carrier. (Photo by James Gathany/ U.S. Centers for Disease Control)Rhode Island’s first case of West Nile Virus this year has been detected in an East Providence mosquito sample, state health officials announced Thursday.  
A mosquito sample collected on July 21 as part of routine trapping work by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) later tested positive for West Nile Virus at state laboratories.
According to the state’s mosquito surveillance data, the positive mosquito was Aedes albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, which federal disease control officials classify as among the “Most (un)Wanted Mosquitoes” when it comes to spreading disease.   
This is the first mosquito to test positive in Rhode Island in 2025 — comparable to the 2024 mosquito season, when the first positive sample emerged around July 15. 
The other 192 mosquito samples tested — representing a total of 2,838 mosquitoes — were free of other diseases like Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) or Jamestown Canyon Virus, according to the Rhode Island Department of Health.
West Nile Virus is the most common mosquito-borne disease in the country. While it tends to be asymptomatic, about one in five people develop West Nile fever, which includes symptoms like headache, body aches or other flu-like symptoms. 
A small number of infections lead to neuroinvasive illness, such as encephalitis or meningitis. About 10% of these severe cases can be fatal, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Most of those fatal cases are among adults over 60 and immunocompromised people.
Preliminary CDC data for 2025 points to 53 cases of neuroinvasive West Nile nationwide, out of 98 West Nile Virus cases recorded overall. 
The CDC notes, however, that the national database relies on county-level data, meaning under-reporting is common. People who don’t contract neuroinvasive illness are less likely to be reported, which can skew data to represent more severe cases. 
Between 1999 and 2024, CDC recorded 60,992 West Nile Virus cases in humans, with 3,134 deaths. 
Rhode Island health officials advise residents to take caution and wear insect repellent, long sleeves, and pants when outside at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. Getting rid of standing water, which attracts mosquitoes, also limits the areas where they can breed.
Weekly mosquito testing data is available on the health department’s website, and more prevention tips and resources can be found at health.ri.gov/mosquito and dem.ri.gov/mosquito.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderCobb County Superior Court’s clerk has been charged with two counts of destruction of public records and two counts of violation of oath of office by a grand jury Thursday. 
The clerk, Connie Taylor, had been the subject of a yearslong joint investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Georgia Attorney General’s White Collar and Cyber Crime Unit into her handling of public records.
The clerk’s office is responsible for maintaining official court records. 
Taylor, a Democrat, was first elected in 2020, defeating a Republican incumbent. But she later came under fire for pocketing over $425,000 in passport fees paid by Cobb County residents, which is permitted under a Georgia law allowing superior court clerks to use the fees to supplement their income.
In 2024, state Sen. Kay Kirkpatrick, a Marietta Republican, introduced Senate Bill 19, a bill requiring clerks to disclose the amount of revenue they generate from passport fees. The bill was signed into law later that year, and took effect this past January.
Taylor became the subject of a Georgia Bureau of Investigation probe in 2022 after a whistleblower complaint accused her of directing employees to delete government emails and financial records related to the passport fees in response to an open records request filed by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
Nearly three years later, she now faces formal charges.
“The intentional destruction of public records is a serious offense that undermines transparency and public trust,” GBI Director Chris Hosey said in a statement. “We remain committed to working alongside our local, state, and federal partners to ensure accountability and uphold the integrity of government operations across Georgia.”
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr also weighed in on the indictment.
“Georgians deserve honesty and transparency from their elected officials, and anything less undermines public trust,” Carr said. “Any attempts to conceal or destroy government records are serious allegations that cannot be ignored, and those responsible will be held accountable.”
Neither Taylor nor her attorney, former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, responded to a request for comment.

Little on Thursday nominated Juliet Charron to become the director of Idaho’s largest state government agency. She will lead the agency starting Sept. 15, 2025, the governor’s office announced in a news release. 
Charron, who has worked for Health and Welfare for nearly four years, will lead the agency at a time of deep federal cuts to public assistance programs. Idaho Medicaid is also gearing up for a range of new cost-cutting measures like work requirements and shifting all benefits to being managed by private companies, under a new law passed this year by the Idaho Legislature. 
“Juliet Charron brings an impressive level of knowledge, experience, and leadership ability to lead Health and Welfare, an agency that serves hundreds of thousands of Idahoans through its various programs,” the governor said in a statement. “I am confident she will lead Health and Welfare with integrity and transparency and with an eye for delivering services with the greatest efficiency.”

 Idaho agency’s current director may join Trump administration

The agency’s current director, Alex Adams, was nominated by President Donald Trump to a federal health position. Earlier Thursday, a U.S. Senate committee advanced Adams’ nomination to serve as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s assistant secretary for family support to the full U.S. Senate.
Adams became Idaho Department of Health and Welfare director in June 2024. 
Little thanked Adams for his service in Idaho. 
“His visionary approach over the years helped us achieve big priorities for Idaho and I am excited to see what he achieves for the American people while working under President Trump,” the governor added. 
 Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, the largest state agency, runs public assistance programs and more

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare runs public assistance programs like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Women and Infant Children program. The health department also provides public health services, regulates long-term care facilities, runs the state’s mental health hospitals, provides child welfare and provides services for people with developmental disabilities. 
Little’s appointment of Charron to direct the agency is subject to approval by the Idaho Senate next legislative session. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is Idaho’s largest state government agency, with a more than $5 billion budget that is mostly federal funds.
In a statement, Charron said she looked forward to pursuing “clear outcomes in our programs and services” and delivering “aggressive transparency across the agency.”
“It is an honor and a privilege to continue to serve the people of Idaho and lead the dedicated team at the Department of Health and Welfare as we strengthen the health, safety, and independence of Idahoans,” she said. “I look forward to collaboratively working with our many stakeholders, including state policymakers, advocates, Idaho taxpayers, and those we serve, to tirelessly pursue clear outcomes in our programs and services, provide excellent customer service, and deliver aggressive transparency across the agency.”
 Charron led Idaho Medicaid through managed care plans, Medicaid disenrollment through ‘unwinding’

In 2021, Charron became the administrator of Idaho Medicaid. In 2024, she became deputy director for Medicaid and behavioral health.
Idaho Medicaid to be privately managed in 2029, health officials expect

In her time leading Idaho Medicaid, she regularly presented to lawmakers as the Legislature explored privatizing Medicaid benefit management. That model, called managed care, is used widely across the country and is meant to stabilize Medicaid costs. For years, Republican state lawmakers have worried about Idaho Medicaid’s rising budget — leading to a cost-cutting law this year that includes a shift to managed care. 
Charron also managed Idaho Medicaid when the state removed tens of thousands of Idahoans from Medicaid after the end of pandemic-era protections that essentially barred states from removing people from Medicaid. That process is commonly called Medicaid unwinding. 
Governor’s office officials said Charron strengthened oversight of Idaho’s largest government contracts, saving costs for taxpayers and improving health outcomes.  She also used data to guide decisions to identify cost containment areas, governor’s office officials said.

For the first six months, anyone stopped for holding a cellphone while driving — whether talking, texting or watching videos — will receive a warning. But starting Feb. 28, violators will be handed a costly ticket.
“We recognize that this law will cause a very significant change in driving habits for many drivers. So, we will educate first,” Robert Woods, director of the Department of Public Safety, said at a ceremonial bill signing Thursday.

State officials gathered at the Statehouse to celebrate South Carolina becoming the 33rd state to enact such a law, which Gov. Henry McMaster signed in mid-May.
Distracted driving is a contributing factor in more than 20,000 traffic collisions in the state each year, according to DPS.
“We are confident this law will prevent collisions and save lives,” Woods said. “It is important to know that our troopers and officers of the Department of Public Safety, working in cooperation with our local law enforcement partners, will strictly enforce this law.”
Hands-free phone calls and voice-to-text messaging remain legal. And drivers can still have their phones in hand when parked, reporting traffic accidents or during a medical emergency.
“It’s just common sense, but sometimes it takes a law to remind everybody of that common sense,” McMaster said.
“To see some of our people unnecessarily hurt, damaged, to see families suffer from acts of inattention, it’s something that’s just a crying shame,” the governor added.
Fines start at $100 for a first offense. For second or subsequent offenses, the fine rises to $200 and a two-point assessment against your driver’s license, a penalty Woods said is likely to get people’s attention and act as a deterrent.
Without a hands-free driving law, SC could lose upwards of $40M in federal road funding

To get the word out about the new law, the state Department of Transportation will install signs along state roads and display messages on the agency’s digital displays along interstates.
The state Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism will also alert visitors of the law with signs at its interstate welcome centers.
Attending the bill’s ceremonial signing was the widow of the late Dale Willenberg of Chesnee, along with one of his twin daughters and a grandson.
An avid cyclist, Willenberg died in 2017 at the age of 57 after he was struck by a driver in a hit-and-run.
According to prosecutors, the driver had looked down to check his cellphone before the collision, then fled the scene. The driver later turned himself in to police. He was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison for the fatal hit-and-run, WYFF-TV news reported.
“I do not want anyone in this room to suffer the trauma we have suffered — lives crushed under grief and a legacy interrupted needlessly,” said his widow, Kelly Willenberg.
“Choosing screen over safety is not an option. This bill is more than legislation. It is a vow to protect what matters most for us,” she said. “It’s not just a policy. It’s a promise born of our pain and purpose. Our roads will be governed by responsibility, awareness and respect.
Let this law stand as a reminder that no message, no text, no ping or post, is worth the price of a human life.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dsc_4808_54691497196_o-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-31 17:56:57.168973

(Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator) Republican attorneys general from 15 states, including Louisiana’s Liz Murrill, are calling on Congress to prevent states where abortion is legal from shielding doctors who prescribe abortion-inducing medication for people in states where the procedure is banned. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion immediately became restricted in most Republican-controlled states, including Louisiana. Since then, people in conservative states seeking abortion medication have looked to doctors in states without bans to prescribe the needed drugs via telehealth visits. Some jurisdictions, including New York, have shield laws that protect physicians from legal consequences in abortion ban states. 
“Out-of-state abortion pill peddlers are violating the criminal laws of Louisiana and other states across the country that choose life,” Murrill said. “They aren’t providing healthcare, they’re drug dealers.” 
The AG’s letter calls on Congress to implement a law that would pre-empt state-level shield laws. 
“This may ensure that each State retains the ability to restrict abortions as it sees fit within its borders without interference from other States and preserves federalism principles,” the attorneys general wrote. 
Murrill has taken an active role in the prosecution of a West Baton Rouge Parish mother who provided abortion-inducing medication to her then minor daughter and the New York doctor who prescribed the medication. The indictment came earlier this year and is the first criminal case of its kind since Roe v. Wade was overturned. 
The attorneys general argue that shield laws pose constitutional concerns, as they could violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which requires states to respect judicial proceedings in other states. The signees also argue the laws could violate the constitution’s extradition clause.
Murrill has pressed to have the New York physician, Dr. Margaret Carpenter, extradited to Louisiana to face charges. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has also sued Carpenter for sending abortion medication to a woman in his state.

Inside the only room left standing, pieces of plaster and foam insulation cover the sunken floor. A radio, an ornate console table and floor-length drapes, still hanging behind steel-frame windows, are the sole indications that someone once cared for this place. 
In August, the storied home will go up for auction for the 7th year in a row because of unpaid taxes – joining thousands of properties across Jackson stuck in a complicated loop and for which no one claims responsibility.
Nearly 30 years ago, the home’s original owner, a fashionable woman named Arthurine Wansley, impressed her neighbors with the upgrades she’d made to the ranch-style home, recalled Lee Davis, a retired hospital environmental service technician who lives next door. Ceiling fans, wood-paneled walls and a cheerful lime green facade. 
“Anybody would want to have a house like that,” Davis, 69, said.
But ever since Wansley developed dementia and her relatives moved her to California in the early 2000s, Davis bore witness as the home fell into dereliction. Wansley, who is still listed as the property’s owner in county records, died nearly 20 years ago. When the waist-high grass started to encroach on his lawn, Davis called the city of Jackson for help.

Then one day a few months ago, Davis noticed a for-sale sign outside the house. It was red, white and blue and said “Best Properties.” So Davis dialed the number on the sign to ask if they were going to cut the grass.
No, the woman who answered said – though the investment company she represented, also known as Viking Investments, is indeed selling the property for $2,500.
“They said they don’t do that, it’s the city’s responsibility,” Davis said. 
2300 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive had been sold for unpaid taxes. But that doesn’t mean the government can force the investor to clean it up.
When a property owner doesn’t pay taxes, Mississippi counties hold an auction called a tax sale. The goal is to collect much-needed local revenue.

But in Jackson, where thousands of parcels go to auction each year, properties stuck in a tax sale loop year after year perpetuate blight. The bidders are often not prospective homeowners but investors who seek to profit from collecting interest on the unpaid taxes. 
The scope of the problem is hard to quantify. To complicate matters, when investors come to own the properties they’ve bid on, there is no legal obligation for them to secure the property in their name. The outdated recordkeeping keeps the city of Jackson from knowing who owns these properties, impeding code enforcement efforts. 
Investors also don’t have to pay the taxes, punting the property back to a tax sale.
“We’re a lien investment company. We’re not really wanting to acquire property,” said Nick Miller, the owner of Viking, which is based in downtown Jackson. “That’s a byproduct of investing in the tax liens.” 
Viking has not paid taxes on 2300 since it acquired the property. So unless someone bids on it during this year’s tax sale in August, it will fall to the state.
The government, then, will be responsible for cleaning it up. To work on a property, the city must send notices to whoever is listed as the owner on the Hinds County landroll. 
For two years after Jackson opened a code enforcement case on 2300, Jackson sent repeated notices to Wansley’s last known address in California — even though she was not living and lost the home at the 2021 tax sale. 
“You just found the perfect storm,” said Bill Chaney, an assistant secretary of state who oversees tax-forfeited properties that do not sell at auction. “This is an indication of all the cracks in the system.”
Outdated records leave properties dangling
2300 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive went up for auction in the fall of 2019 after someone in Wansley’s family failed to pay the initial $1,764 tax bill, according to Hinds County records. Despite repeated attempts, Mississippi Today could not reach any of Wansley’s relatives in California. 
Over the next several years, a series of investment companies – some local, some not – bid on the unpaid taxes: GSRAN-Z LLC, Quicksilver Tax Funding LLC, College Investment Co., and FIG 20 LLC. None of these companies responded to Mississippi Today’s inquiries. 
In what’s called the “redemption period,” Wansley’s family had two years to pay the overdue taxes. When that didn’t happen, her property became leverage. The winning bidders gained an opportunity to take her home through a document called a tax deed, which according to state law is “a perfect title with the immediate right of possession to the land sold for taxes.” 
But none of the companies filed the tax deed with the Hinds County Chancery Clerk, likely because they could not find anyone to buy it and they did not want to become responsible for the condition of Wansley’s home.

The practice is common. There is no legal requirement to file the tax deed, nor is there a financial incentive. These companies often operate on slim margins, and the tax deed costs money. Plus, they may not want to end up like Wansley – listed as the owner of properties they aren’t responsible for.
“Are we going to be on that landroll record for the next 15 years until they update the record?” Miller said. 
Chancery clerks need a deed to update a county’s landrolls, according to Lakeysia Liddell, the manager of Hinds County land division. So when companies don’t file a tax deed, the number of blighted properties in Jackson owned by tax investors remains unknown. People who lost their homes because of unpaid taxes continue to receive notices.
“They come in trying to pay those taxes thinking they can keep their property even though the redemption period has expired,” Liddell said.  
Jackson’s code enforcement officers also rely on the landroll to send notices to property owners in violation. Robert Brunson, Jackson’s code enforcement manager, said that ideally, the city would take these companies to environmental court, where a judge can levy fines and even criminal penalties for dilapidated properties like 2300. 
That accountability can’t happen if the city doesn’t know who the owner is. Brunson said Viking will come to environmental court if they have an interest in the property, because the city can use county records to find out if that is the case. But that doesn’t always happen: Viking is not listed as an one of the “interested parties” on the code violation notice for 2300. 
“This is a business deal to them, to make money off the city of Jackson, off of Hinds County, really,” Brunson said. “We need more teeth, to be honest with you.” 
To keep the chain of title clear, the companies will file the tax deed if they find a buyer for the property. But they may just let the property fall back to the tax sale to be dealt with by someone else. 
Viking, which also hasn’t filed a tax deed for 2300, acquired the home in 2024 after the last bidder – the Jacksonville, Florida-based FIG 20 LLC – transferred its interest in the property to a Viking affiliate called SDG 20, according to a quitclaim deed filed in Hinds County. 
Miller declined to say how much SDG paid FIG for the properties, but all told, he estimates he has sunk about $2,000 into the property on Margaret Walker Alexander Drive. If he sells it, he will make a couple hundred dollars. 
The tax sale gamble
Miller, a Jackson resident, views his job as something of a public service, because his bids on Mississippians’ unpaid taxes help fund county services like libraries or police. 
Spread across hundreds of parcels a year in Hinds County – thousands across the state – Miller can make a profit. His goal is not to get property, but to make money off the financial penalties owed by the original owner, including 1.5% monthly interest on the unpaid taxes. 
When that doesn’t happen, and Miller becomes the owner, it’s as if he lost the bet. Acquiring blighted property is just a risk of the game; the gamble then becomes whether Viking can sell it. 

Nick Miller, president of Viking Investments, sits in his office in downtown Jackson, Miss., on Thursday, July 31, 2025.
“You’re looking at just returning your investment with interest,” said Andy Hammond, a Young, Wells, Williams attorney who Miller occasionally consults. “You can’t expect to actually get property. That just ends up happening.” 
The seemingly accidental way Miller comes to own property in Jackson is why he’s frustrated when Viking is blamed for the city’s blight, which existed before he bid on unpaid taxes. 
“How are we the problem if we’re willing to take a risk and invest $2 million in Hinds County a year?” Miller said. 
Of course, when Miller acquires a property, he does not usually pay the next year’s taxes, so any property purchase from Viking would also likely come with a hefty tax bill.
If the city wants to hold tax sale investors more accountable for the condition of the properties they own, Mississippi’s tax sale laws need to be changed, according to Miller, Hammond and Sam Martin, a lobbyist who is helping them form a tax lien investor association. 
“That gets you to the pickle that all of this has created,” Hammond said. “You have a city that wants certain things done but a law that disincentivizes the tax sale purchaser from doing anything.” 
Hammond and his associates said they don’t know yet what the solution is, but one possible idea is to make it easier for the investor to clear title to his or her tax-forfeited properties.

Original owners who’ve lost their homes through tax sales can often get their property back if they can hire an attorney and go to court, especially if they didn’t receive a warning they could lose their property. 
The tax sale buyer will lose the money they’ve put into improving the property, Hammond said. That risk means Viking will not work on its properties without going through a court process called a title confirmation suit.
“Let’s say we go in there without confirming the title first and we fix it up and we clean it up,” Miller said. “What do you think is going to happen? That homeowner is going to have a renewed interest in that property.” 
But some in government say these investors should be made to take more responsibility for their properties. Last year, the Legislature considered but did not pass a bill that would have required people who gain properties through the tax sale to file the tax deed within 90 days or else cede their interest to the state.
Chaney, from the Secretary of State’s office, said Viking’s defense that it hasn’t confirmed the titles to its properties is tantamount to “legalese for ‘I don’t want to clean it up.’ ‘We own it, but we don’t really own it.’ Well, trust me, they’ll sell it in a heartbeat.” 
That’s if they can find a buyer. Most of the time, the properties that Miller’s companies come to own are as blighted as 2300 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive.

“This property right here is a prime example of what mostly matures to us,” Miller said. “People walk away from it because they don’t want to deal with it.”  
Neither does Miller. But he said cleaning it up could be worth it to someone, if they can afford it.
“The neighbor could buy it for $2,500 if he wanted to tear it down and clean it up,” Miller said. 
Blight on historic block
If someone wanted to buy 2300 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive, they might look through public records to determine who owns the home – a common process for people who dabble in tax-forfeited parcels called a “title search.” 
That search would end at a piece of paper 435 pages into a thick, leather-bound book on the second floor of the Hinds County Chancery Clerk’s Office. This is the proof of ownership that Arthurine Wansley and her husband, Louis Wade Wansley, received when they bought the home in 1956, on a block known back then as Guynes Street. 
With three bedrooms, a carport, and central air and heat, it’s likely the house was built just for them. The Lanier High School graduates had joined a special community, the first-of-its-kind in Mississippi: A subdivision built by Black entrepreneurs for Black middle class families. 
At that time, the housing options for Black Jacksonians were subpar and relegated to undesirable parts of the city. 
“That community, that stability, that landownership, that power would have been really important,” said Robby Luckett, director of Jackson State University’s Margaret Walker Center. 
A teacher in Jackson Public Schools, Arthurine Wansley played bridge with Margaret Walker Alexander, the acclaimed writer after whom the street is now named. She helped run neighborhood Spade and Fork Garden club with Myrlie Evers, the wife of civil rights icon Medgar Evers.

The families on the block were known for looking after each other’s kids and trading cucumbers and tomatoes they’d grown in their backyards. Wansley’s grandnephew, Michael Wade Wansley, grew up visiting 2300 for parties or holiday celebrations, when residents competed for the best Christmas decorations. 
“We didn’t even think about it being a historic block when I was growing up,” he said. “We just knew that Dr. Margaret Walker Alexander lived on that block. George Harmon lived on that block. He owned Harmon’s Drug Store on Farish Street. So it was, I mean, everybody over there was either involved in politics or educated.” 
But the tight-knit community ended on the corner of Ridgeway Street, where a working-class white neighborhood began, said Keena Graham, the superintendent of the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument. 
“You’re having a great time on this street, but you don’t go over too much, too far afield,” Graham said. “Two streets over, that’s dangerous.” 
Much of that history is recounted in a 2013 application to include the Medgar Evers Historic District — which encompasses Margaret Walker Alexander Drive — on the National Register of Historic Places. 
As an original home to the block, 2300 is covered by that designation. But that didn’t stop the home from falling into the tax sale loop.
“I knew it all of my life as a middle-class-type neighborhood,” said Frank Figgers, a member of Shady Grove M.B. Church just around the corner from 2300. “When that’s where your teachers lived, where your pharmacist lived, I just don’t think I’ll ever see it as blight.” 
In search of a responsible party 
Some family members of the original residents of Margaret Walker Alexander Drive still live in their homes. But the block today is mostly retirees like Davis, renter, and empty houses, surrounded by overgrown land, that are falling apart. 
In neighborhoods like this, nonprofits, such one run by Jackson-area state Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr, have used the tax sale to buy homes and rehabilitate them. 
“I always tell people it’s good to have a good attorney on hand to do those title searches for you,” Crudup said. 
More often, though, the tax sale loop creates a cycle of frustration.

When private individuals can’t or won’t fix up a property, the government must step in. The state owns more than 1,800 tax-forfeited properties in Jackson, according to data from the secretary of state — plots that no one wanted to buy at the tax sale auction. 
“We got it in even worse condition than it was when it was in a bad condition,” Chaney said. 
Brunson feels similarly. He has a handful of code enforcement officers for the entire city, but some Jacksonians complain his team is nowhere to be found. 
“They won’t cut the grass, but they’ll sell it,” Brunson said of tax sale investors. “There should be a law against that, taking these people’s money, saying, ‘Oh well, you didn’t do your title search, thank you for $3,000 down.’”
But if the city started fining tax sale investors for the blight, Miller said some of them may stop bidding. 
“People are going to drop out of the system,” Miller said. “If nobody is there to bid on these liens, what’s going to happen to the $19 million deficiency every year – struck to the state?” 
It doesn’t seem likely anyone from Wansley’s family will save the property. Michael Wade Wansley, the grandnephew, is retired and lives in Pennsylvania. He said he doesn’t think he has any relatives left in Jackson. He wondered why Davis and his neighbors let the home deteriorate.
“I would think if people were still living over there they wouldn’t have let it go down to that level of poverty,” he said. 
Barbara Walker, a retired teacher who lives directly across from 2300, used to go half and half with another neighbor to pay someone to cut the grass. 
“To me, it was worth the investment,” she said. “I didn’t want the place looking as bad as it’s looking.” 
When her neighbor moved away, Walker couldn’t afford the landscaping on her own. That’s when Davis started calling the city, hoping they’d cut the grass. 
Informed that Miller said he could buy the property, Davis seemed puzzled. 
“Who, me?” he said. 
Every now and then, Davis will ask his lawn guy to mow a patch of grass by Viking’s for-sale sign. But until the overgrowth is addressed, Davis won’t let his 6-year-old granddaughter play outside when she comes to visit. He’s killed too many snakes in his yard. 
In November, the city council declared the home a public nuisance, the first step to tear it down. Jackson will have to hire a company to do the demolition, which requires attaching a lien, or a debt that must be repaid, on the property. Whoever buys it next will have to repay that lien.
On a recent Tuesday, Davis looked at the pink and yellow notices – orders condemning the home – that Brunson pinned inside the decaying carport. When he opened the carport closet, he realized the water heater had been stolen. The only items left were glass Coca-Cola bottles, silver tinsel and a Santa Hat. 
Walker said she hopes 2300 can become a park once the house is demolished: “It’s already tearing itself down.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/16132935/3X0A8393.jpg,,,2025-07-31 16:56:31.388655

Article Summary

A new Illinois law is scheduled to implement annual mental health screenings in public schools beginning during the 2027-28 school year.
The screenings would be available for students in third grade through high school, but parents can opt their children out of the requirement.
The screenings will not cost schools any money but will only be available in years when the state has given money to the State Board of Education to develop a screening tool.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Illinois public school students could soon receive free mental health screenings each year.
Gov. JB Pritzker signed Senate Bill 1560 Thursday, which would require the State Board of Education and a children’s behavioral health team within the governor’s office to develop procedures and make mental health materials available to school districts. The board will provide those materials to schools beginning in September 2026.
The tests would be provided to schools at no cost beginning in the 2027-28 school year, so long as the state has approved funding to develop screenings. Parents would be able to opt their children out of the screenings, which would be made available once a year to students in third grade through high school.
“This is a national first that’s worth celebrating about the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said at a news conference Thursday at an Evanston middle school.
The bill was approved by the Senate 52-0 but passed on a partisan 72-36 vote in the House.
Pritzker said it’s important to overcome the stigma around getting help for mental health issues and to treat mental health as a priority, like physical health. Illinois schools already offer screenings for vision and hearing problems and require students to have physical checkups with their pediatrician.
“We know how transformational these screenings can be for kids at this age,” Pritzker said. “They provide early identification and intervention so those who are struggling get the help that they need as soon as possible. They improve academic and social outcomes. They help us break down the stigma that too often is a barrier to seeking help.”
State Superintendent of Education Tony Sanders said mental health issues are one of the leading causes of hospitalization for children and teenagers and schools can play a role in preventing problems from reaching a point that requires more extreme intervention.
“Too often we recognize a student’s distress when it becomes a crisis, when they begin failing classes, when they begin withdrawing from peers or experiencing harm,” Sanders said. “Too often, we only recognize a student’s distress when it’s too late.”
The new policy would allow schools to focus on preventing mental health issues rather than only implementing plans that react to a student’s problem.
House Republicans opposed the bill, arguing it won’t be as effective as the governor believes and that it creates confidentiality problems.
“Universal mental health screenings are going to get us nothing except possibly finding things, finding reasons for denial of coverage of insurance,” Rep. Steve Reick, R-Woodstock, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.

,DC,2025-07-31 20:26:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump’s big proposed cuts to health and education spending rebuffed by US Senate panel,"Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-big-proposed-cuts-health-and-education-spending-rebuffed-us-senate-panel,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations Thursday largely rejected Trump administration proposals to slash funding for education programs, medical research grants, health initiatives and Ukraine security assistance.Instead, senators from both parties agreed to increase spending in the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education spending bill for fiscal year 2026, as well as the Defense bill, and rebuked the White House's move to dismantle the Department of Education.The pushback against President Donald Trump was significant as Congress heads toward a possible standoff and partial government shutdown when the fiscal year expires on Sept. 30.In response to the Trump administration’s separate cancellation of grants and freezing of funds approved by Congress, senators also included language in the Labor-HHS-Education spending bill to create deadlines for formula grants to be released to states on time.Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said the bill to fund the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education “prioritizes funding to make Americans healthier and supports life-saving medical research through targeted funding.”The measure provides $116.6 billion for HHS, an increase of $446 million in discretionary funding over the previous fiscal year. Included is a $150 million increase for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer’s disease research, as well as a ban on an administration cap on indirect costs at the National Institutes of Health, according to a summary from Democrats. The cap on how much NIH pays research universities and medical schools for indirect costs is the subject of a permanent injunction in an ongoing lawsuit.Trump’s budget proposal also cut funding for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to $4.2 billion, but senators voted to instead allocate $9.1 billion for the agency.Also included is $8.8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant and nearly $12.4 billion for Head Start.The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, said that while the bill rejects many of the funding cuts from the Trump administration, it’s “only half of the equation.”“We have an administration right now that is intent on ignoring Congress, breaking the law, and doing everything it can without any transparency, to dismantle programs and agencies that help families,” she said. “There is no magic bullet that will change that unfortunate reality.”Murray also expressed her disappointment that the bill did not fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Trump sent what is known as a rescissions request to Congress, approved by both chambers, that yanked $1.1 billion in previously approved funding over the next two years for the agency, which funds NPR and PBS.The Labor-HHS-Education spending bill for fiscal year 2026 passed out of the Senate committee with a bipartisan 26-3 vote.Senators also passed the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2026 on a 26-3 vote.Dismantling of Education Department spurnedThe bill text tightens requirements so that Education Department staffing levels must be sufficient to carry out the agency’s missions, and its work cannot be outsourced to other agencies or departments to fulfill statutory responsibilities, according to Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the spending panel dealing with Labor-HHS-Education spending. The agency saw a reduction in force, or RIF, earlier this year that gutted more than 1,300 employees and hit wide swaths of the department. The Supreme Court cleared the way earlier in July for the agency to temporarily proceed with those mass layoffs.The bill also provides $5.78 billion for School Improvement Programs — which support before- and after-school programs, rural education, STEM education and college and career counseling, among other initiatives.Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request had called for $12 billion in spending cuts at the Education Department but the committee allocated $79 billion in discretionary funding.Education Secretary Linda McMahon defended Trump’s sweeping proposals while appearing in June before the Senate Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee.During Thursday’s markup, Murray called the president’s proposal to defund the Department of Education “absurd.”“I still hope we can do more when it comes to demanding accountability, transparency, and that this administration actually follows our laws,” Murray said. “We all know President Trump cannot dismantle the Department of Education or ship education programs to other agencies. Authorizing laws prevent that.”The agency has witnessed a dizzying array of cuts and changes since Trump took office, as he and his administration look to dramatically overhaul the federal role in education and dismantle the department.The bill maintains the same maximum annual award for the Pell Grant from the previous award year at $7,395. The government subsidy helps low-income students pay for college.Trump’s budget request had called for cutting nearly $1,700 from the maximum award.Health spendingBaldwin said the overall bill is a “compromise.” She pointed to how Republicans and Democrats agreed to increase funds for the 988 Suicide hotline by $2 million and by another $20 million for substance abuse recovery.The spending bill will also provide $1.6 billion for State Opioid Response grants, which is a formula-based grant for states to address the opioid crisis.Senators rejected the Trump administration’s request to cut National Institutes of Health research by 40% and instead included a more than $400 million bump in funding for a total of $48.7 billion.Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff said that he was grateful that the committee worked on a bipartisan basis to reject major Trump cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in his home state.“I made (it) very clear that I would not accept the destruction of the CDC,” Ossoff said. “I am grateful that Republicans and Democrats on this committee are coming together to defend this vital institution based in the state of Georgia.”Advocates for medical research praised the legislation.“Chair Collins and Vice Chair Murray deserve special recognition for their leadership in making this a priority. Thousands of ACS CAN volunteers from across the country have been writing to their lawmakers on this issue and it’s deeply encouraging to see their voices have been heard loud and clear,” Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said in a statement.AmeriCorps, Job Corps funding sustainedTrump’s budget request also proposed $4.6 billion in spending cuts at the Department of Labor. The spending bill also maintains funding for Job Corps, a residential career training program for young adults, at $1.76 billion.Trump’s budget request sought to eliminate the program entirely.The administration says the program is “financially unsustainable, has an exorbitant perparticipant cost, risks the safety of young adults, and has often made participants worse off,” according to a summary of the budget request.The spending bill also includes $15 billion for the Social Security Administration, an increase of $100 million from the president’s budget request, to address staffing shortages.The administration also proposed the elimination of AmeriCorps.However, senators kept funding for AmeriCorps for fiscal year 2026 at $1.25 billion.Defense spending also increasedThe Defense appropriations spending bill for fiscal year 2026 that senators worked on represented an increase from the president’s budget request.“I think not only the prior administration, but this administration as well, have underestimated the level of challenge that we have,” said Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Defense appropriations panel.The Kentucky Republican said the bill provides $851.9 billion for fiscal year 2026.He said the topline is higher than the president’s budget request because “we cannot seriously address these challenges while artificially constraining our resources” — challenges such as the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East.The bill also rejects the Trump administration's effort to slash funding to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia.“Shutting off engagement with Ukraine would undermine our military's efforts to prepare for the modern battlefield,” McConnell said.During the markup of the defense spending bill, Sen. Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, introduced an amendment to require the Department of Homeland Security to reimburse costs to the Department of Defense for immigration enforcement.As the Trump administration aims to carry out its plans for mass deportation of people without permanent legal status, it’s intertwined the U.S. military and immigration enforcement, ranging from deploying the National Guard to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles to housing immigrants on the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba military base.Durbin said that so far, DHS has cost the Defense Department $900 million, from personnel costs to housing immigrants on military bases.Durbin said the cost to house 180 people on Guantanamo Bay cost the Department of Defense $40 million over three months.His amendment failed on a 14-15 vote.",,,,2025-07-31 16:56:31.388655

Only a dozen states have laws establishing suicide prevention offices or coordinators, and just 11 have task forces or committees dedicated to suicide prevention efforts, according to a new report.
The report comes amid sweeping cuts at federal agencies that offer mental health support. They include significant slashes in staffing and funding at the nation’s largest mental health and substance use agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to fold SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America.
Released last week, the report was conducted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials with support from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The analysis is part of an online resource breaking down details of suicide prevention efforts at the state level.

As of Jan. 1, just a dozen states had offices or state coordinators focused on suicide prevention: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Some states have these offices mandated by law and others were established through executive orders.
Eleven states (Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah and Washington) plus Puerto Rico have laws requiring a task force, commission or advisory group focused on suicide prevention.
The report notes prevention efforts are most effective when they are focused on higher-risk populations, areas, age groups and occupations. Suicide risk is higher among rural residents, older adults, American Indian and Alaska Native people, people with disabilities, veterans and groups that identify with a sexual minority. The federal administration recently pulled the plug on LGBTQ+ specialized supports under the national suicide hotline, 988.
About 60% of states — 29 states and Washington, D.C. — have laws that establish some form of fatality review committees that specifically include suicide deaths in reviews. Areas of focus varied among the states. Some had statewide teams and others were on the local level, according to the report.
The report notes that another 11 states assign prevention responsibilities within other offices. Minnesota law, for example, assigns such tasks to the state commissioner of health, rather than toward a special suicide prevention office or coordinator.
In 2023, the nation saw 49,000 deaths by suicide, according to the CDC. Firearms are involved in more than half of suicides.

Fey/for South Dakota Searchlight)The governor-appointed board overseeing the state’s technical colleges endorsed a $49 million state budget request for fiscal year 2027 on Thursday, which includes requests for increased student support and infrastructure funding across South Dakota’s four technical colleges.
The vote came during the South Dakota Board of Technical Education’s meeting at Western Dakota Technical College in Rapid City. Board Executive Director Nick Wendell presented the priorities, which he said were developed in collaboration with the state’s technical college presidents. It now heads to the governor’s administration for consideration during the state budget process.
Universities push to restore campus maintenance funding after $9 million legislative cut

The state’s four public technical colleges are Lake Area, Mitchell, Southeast and Western Dakota. The board is responsible for setting policy, approving budgets, and advocating for resources that support career-focused education and workforce development. The board is composed of nine members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate. 
The approved request of $49 million is up $2 million from the previous fiscal year.
About $41 million would go toward the per-student allocation, raising it to $6,992 (up $158) per pupil. The funds help cover the basic costs of running the technical colleges, including instruction, equipment and campus operations. The per-student increase accounts for a 2.5% inflation adjustment and a request to allocate $3 million for equipment funding into the ongoing budget, rather than relying on one-time requests year after year. 
The board also approved a request to nearly double maintenance and repair funding, bringing it to $3.84 million from $1.8 million. Wendell said the request aims to restore the state’s original 2018 plan to match 1% of the total replacement value of technical college facilities, with the system contributing the other 1% to meet a shared 2% investment goal.
The state’s fiscal year budget proposal will be developed by the governor and considered by legislators during the upcoming winter legislative session.

(File Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State Superintendent Ellen Weaver is seeking total control of Jasper County School District, citing a report that found potential fraud, conflicts of interest and mismanagement.
Many of the allegations involve the district’s largely absent superintendent who was living and running several businesses hours away from Jasper County, according to the inspector general’s report.
The decision by Weaver, which needs approval by the state Board of Education, came just over a week after the board agreed to take financial control of Marlboro County School District.
The state Board of Education is expected to vote Tuesday on whether to take control of Jasper County’s 2,600-student district.
The state Department of Education has controlled the district’s finances since December, two months after the local board voted to fire its superintendent.
If the state board approves the full takeover, the agency will assume full control of district decisions, including firing the local school board and appointing a superintendent.
SC takes control of rural school district’s finances

Doing so is “the only responsible path forward to safeguard the interests of (the district’s) students and ensure effective use of public resources,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver wrote in a letter addressed to Jasper County’s board Chairwoman Joyce Gerald.
“While I believe that the JCSD Board desires the best outcomes for the students of Jasper County,” it’s not addressing “ongoing and significant challenges,” continued the letter dated Monday.
Nearly 70% of the countywide district’s students live in poverty. The district received nearly $21,000 per student during the 2024-25 school year, with about a third of that coming from state taxes and 11% from federal aid, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Despite the help and resources that accompany state financial control, which included state-approved accountants and third-party consultants, “the 2023 financial records remain in such a condition that an audit is still not possible,” Weaver wrote.
Plus, the district is under investigation by the State Law Enforcement Division after the state inspector general found potential fraud and mismanagement by the district’s former superintendent, Rechel Anderson.
When previously reached by phone two weeks ago, Anderson hung up on a Gazette reporter. She did not respond to an email or voicemail Thursday.
Beyond eventually firing her, the Jasper County board did nothing to reprimand Anderson, according to the July report by Inspector General Brian Lamkin.
The district conducted its own investigation into Anderson in 2024. But when that found evidence of potential ethics and contract violations, the board took its time in firing Anderson and did not report anything to the state, Lamkin wrote.
Because of that, “the Board failed in its most basic duty to act, violating its oath of office, contributing to government waste, and potentially exposing the District (or its officials) to obstruction of justice claims,” Weaver wrote in Monday’s letter.
Gerald declined to comment Thursday to the SC Daily Gazette. A district spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Inspector general’s report
The inspector general got involved last August, when Weaver asked Lamkin’s office to review the district’s finances for potential fraud, mismanagement and/or wrongdoing.
Much of the investigation focused on Anderson, who led the district between 2018 and February of this year. The board voted to fire her in October but kept paying her as negotiations continued on her settlement. Approved in February, the agreement paid $361,566 and declared her departure a resignation, effective in May.
Over her tenure, Anderson repeatedly violated her contract, committed fraud and potentially broke state ethics laws, according to Lamkin’s report.
SC Board of Education OKs financial takeover of Pee Dee school district

A clause in Anderson’s contract allowed her to have a side job only if it didn’t interfere with her role as superintendent.
But employees told inspectors she was rarely in her office or in the schools. And when she was there, she wasn’t doing district work.
Her other jobs included two separate businesses that claimed to operate group homes for children — one in Florence and the other in Darlington.
Lamkin was unable to determine whether the license for the Florence home was legitimate, though the state Department of Social Services paid the company nearly $72,000 for its services between October 2023 and January 2024.
She appeared to buy the property in Darlington using an emergency loan from the school district to buy her own residence that instead went toward her business. Anderson hosted a grand opening for the children’s home in March, but it’s unclear whether it’s been operating since, according to the report.
The Pee Dee is where she apparently lived, also in violation of her contract. According to bank documents, her home was in Florence, at an address 155 miles from the district office in Ridgeland.
Anderson produced a lease suggesting she rented an apartment in the district, but that lease seemed to be fake, according to Lamkin’s report.
She also opened a Caribbean cafe in Myrtle Beach in 2020 and wrote a book, titled “Professional Walk: An Educator’s Perspective,” released in 2022, according to the report.
Also during her tenure, Anderson also worked for Cognia, the group that accredited Jasper County School District. She received about $48,000 from the agency over those seven years, working as both a direct employee and contractor, the investigation found.
Anderson failed to report those payments on her state-required financial statements. Instead, she incorrectly listed her superintendent’s salary as $205,000 — $60,000 more than the district was actually paying her, according to the report.
Anderson’s involvement with Cognia also presented a conflict of interest, since she was working for a group tasked with independently reviewing the district’s operations. On one occasion, she used her position to file a complaint against her own school board, which turned up no actual issues but cost the district nearly $4,600 in legal fees, the investigation found.
Because of that, the district’s accreditation process “was tainted with conflict,” the report read.
The state education department is reviewing the district’s accreditation to understand what sort of effect Anderson’s job might have had on it, Weaver wrote in her Monday letter.
Many of the district’s financial woes dated back to Anderson hiring an interim chief financial officer with a background in information technology instead of searching for a permanent employee with financial experience, the report found.
This “greatly impacted the district’s financial health and ability to properly manage the financial affairs of the district,” according to the report.
All the while, the district did nothing to stop Anderson’s actions or remove her from her position, according to the report and the letter Weaver sent Monday.
As the board negotiated a settlement agreement with Anderson during her termination process, Gerald personally sent her $1,000, then failed to recuse herself from votes about Anderson’s employment, according to the report. It’s unclear why Gerald sent the money.
Other issues went beyond Anderson.
The district paid nearly $112,000 for food at events from catering company NicNac’s.
The records of what that money bought were inconsistent. The caterer received a citation last month for selling food without getting a valid permit through the state Department of Agriculture after Lamkin’s office was unable to find previous inspection records, according to his report.
That created safety concerns, since the caterer had no oversight in its kitchens, the inspector general’s report found.
“These failures, among others, create a crisis of confidence in the Board’s ability to adequately manage and oversee the District’s fiscal dilemmas and provide a clear path forward for the future of Jasper students,” Weaver wrote in her letter.
The state department “has exhausted every less significant measure to rectify JCSD’s fiscal problems,” Weaver wrote.
“The failure to intervene would constitute a dereliction of my duty as State Superintendent to Jasper County’s students and taxpayers,” Weaver wrote.
Two other rural school districts taken over by former Superintendent Molly Spearman remain under state control, though Williamsburg County is in the process of regaining local decision-making powers.
That process hasn’t started for Allendale County, overseen by the state for a second time since 2017.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SC41-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 16:56:31.388655

(File photo by Emmett Gartner/Capital News Service)An attorney representing the Maryland State Board of Elections is asking a Circuit Court judge to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the legality of state-funded primary elections that exclude independent voters.
Five unaffiliated Maryland voters filed suit in May and asked a judge to declare that restrictions on primary elections are a violation of the state constitution. Elections officials, in a response filed Wednesday afternoon, asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed citing a lack of standing and a “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”
Primary elections in Maryland are considered partially closed. Voters are required to affiliate with the Democratic or Republican parties to vote in most primary contests. Nonpartisan races such as the election of judges or school board members are excluded.
In May, five unaffiliated voters, represented by Republican former Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, filed a challenge in court. The 15-page lawsuit asserts that the restrictions — paid for with tax dollars — violate their right to vote.
Rutherford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In his response on behalf of the board, Daniel Kobrin, an assistant attorney general, wrote that a challenge based “solely as taxpayers” is insufficient to establish standing for such a challenge.
The motion filed by Korbin also asks the judge to declare that the five voters have no right to challenge the restrictions on primary elections because of previous court decisions.
Kobrin noted two decisions by the Supreme Court of Maryland that said “voters have no right under the state constitution to vote in the primary elections of a party to which they do not belong.”
In another case, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld closed primaries and a political party’s First Amendment right “not to associate” and therefore cannot be required to allow unaffiliated voters to participate, according to the motion filed by the board’s attorney
Kobrin, in his motion, writes that “the merits of the unaffiliated voters’ challenge have already been rejected.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gartner_Silver_Spring_Voting_Center_inside-newsletter-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-31 16:56:31.388655

Food banks already face high demand and difficult choices about how much they can stay open and what food they can hand out. Many are also burning through reserves they built up during the COVID era, when more donations were rolling in to help people struggling to buy food. This comes as inflation and other factors have kept grocery prices high, worsening food insecurity. 
Temporary boosts to payments under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, that began during the pandemic ended in 2023.
And since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, his administration has cut hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shipments to food banks and funding for them to buy produce, meat, dairy and other food products from local farmers.
Aaron Czyzewski, advocacy and public policy director at Seattle-based Food Lifeline, likens the current circumstances to “going into another pandemic.”
“But this time without the disease, and this time without the federal government coming to help,” he said. “In fact, they’re running away and then taking things with them.”
The West Seattle Food Bank, for example, has had to offer cheaper ground turkey or turkey hot dogs as protein options instead of chicken thighs, as it navigates slashed funding and unprecedented need, said Robbin Peterson, the food bank’s development director. The organization also only provides milk every other week now.
Peterson’s food bank serves anywhere from 300 to 400 people on a normal day, to 650 on a busier day.
“We’re barely scraping by,” she said. “We need to be ready, because it’s going to be bad.”
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program previously required able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 54 without dependents to work at least 20 hours per week to access food stamps. The megabill signed by Trump on July 4 raises the ceiling to age 64 and adds work requirements for parents whose children are at least 14 years old. Previously exempt veterans, former foster youth and people who are homeless would also need to work.
In Washington in April, more than 906,000 people were enrolled in SNAP and received a total of $167 million in benefits. That averages out to about $6 per day per person.
The state says 137,000 people could lose their benefits under the work requirements, and in addition, 33,000 refugees and asylees would no longer be eligible.
Unlike changes to Medicaid, cuts to SNAP take effect this year. In Washington, the food assistance program is known as Basic Food.
The new law also potentially cuts benefits for those who keep them by an average of $56 per month, according to the state, while slashing federal spending on nutrition programs nationwide by an estimated $186 billion over 10 years. 
The White House has said “the mission of the program has failed,” while the GOP overhaul “promotes work, responsibility, and restores SNAP to serve the truly needy.”
What it means for a rural food bank
Many of the clients who frequent the Toppenish Community Chest on the Yakama Reservation are farmworkers. 
They come from across the surrounding rural communities, like Zillah, Wapato and Granger. Those towns have food banks, but people seeking food often visit several around the county to get enough.
About 800 families each month use the Toppenish food bank. In the summers, that usually drops to a couple hundred, as more farmworkers return to the fields, director Cecilia Chavez said. But not this year, as need has remained high. 
If even more people start coming in, the only solution Chavez sees is to reduce the amount of food each person can get. She then figures more people will go further and further away to other food banks to make ends meet.
“They have to find food for their families,” she said.
Food banks in rural parts of the state are also sometimes open just once or twice a month. 
Washington’s two congressional districts in central and eastern Washington have the highest share of residents on SNAP, at 18% and 16.5%, according to federal data. 
Each of those districts is represented by a Republican in Congress — U.S. Reps. Dan Newhouse and Michael Baumgartner. Both men voted for the legislation slashing SNAP to help deliver tax cuts. Newhouse hails from Sunnyside, just east of Toppenish.
The farming economy east of the Cascades does benefit area food banks, as they tend to rely much less on government programs to provide food than those in cities. 
The Community Chest gets food from local grocers and small-time farmers as well as a distribution center, among other sources. But Chavez says the food bank already has very limited supplies in reserve. 
Some clients at the Community Chest have also stopped coming due to fears of immigration enforcement. Peterson has also seen this in West Seattle.
“We have families who are fearful of coming in person, so neighbors will come and collect food for them and deliver it to them personally,” said Em Nitz-Ritter, of statewide hunger relief organization Northwest Harvest. “Oftentimes, those folks need the food support the most, and we’re seeing increasing barriers to their access.”
State support and the path forward
Hunger relief organizations made it out of a tough state legislative session this year largely unscathed. 
Despite a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall, lawmakers earmarked the requested $93 million for emergency food assistance. However, the budget crunch meant the Legislature didn’t deliver on providing free school meals to all of the state’s public school students.
With federal cuts to come, Czyzewski said state lawmakers will need to appropriate more money for food banks to ensure they keep enough food on the shelves. But under the new law, in the coming years, states will also shoulder more costs paying for SNAP.
Peterson fears now that community support won’t be able to fill the huge gaps potentially left by Congress and the White House.
“Most food banks rely on their communities to support them, and of course, those communities are suffering from high food prices too, so that means we’re going to need more donations,” Peterson said. “But is the public ready to do that? Are they in a position to be able to help? I just don’t see how this system is going to sustain the number of hungry people.”
Still, Czyzewski expects that, similar to the pandemic, Washingtonians will respond to food banks’ latest plight with generosity. And Nitz-Ritter already sees more people getting interested in doing what they can to help their neighbors access food.
“It really can’t be overstated how significant the impact of one person caring really does make,” Nitz-Ritter said. “It is extra important in this particular political moment to continue to empower people and for them to hear that, ‘Not all is lost. Things are bleak, but they’re not over, and the need remains, right? And so if the need remains, the work remains.’”

(Photo by Bob Wick/Bureau of Land Management, CC BY-SA)The U.S. Department of the Interior announced on Thursday that it will revoke three documents intended to form the basis for limits on oil drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.
Those documents, and the limits themselves, were issued in the last year of President Joe Biden’s administration.
Since his election, President Donald Trump has prioritized administrative moves that would reverse Biden decisions limiting oil and gas drilling in Alaska.
The latest move targets the Biden administration’s decision to prioritize subsistence hunting and fishing and traditional Indigenous uses in about 3 million acres of the 23-million-acre petroleum reserve that lies west of Prudhoe Bay.
That decision followed prior decisions by the Biden administration and President Barack Obama’s administration that put about half the reserve off limits to oil development.
Now, the Trump administration is planning to open 82% of the reserve to oil and gas drilling.
Thursday’s announcement, rescinding three planning documents, is a step toward that end.
On Wednesday, ahead of the official notice in the Federal Register, all three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation expressed support for the move and praised the Trump administration for taking action.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch) With the opening of a new 43-acre intermodal facility, Salt Lake City’s west side is now the home of two Class I railways, a move that Gov. Spencer Cox says will improve the city’s air quality and help lower prices of goods in the state.
The hub, located off Interstate 80 about 5 miles from Salt Lake City International Airport, is a collaboration between the Texas-based company BNSF Railway, Patriot Rail and the Utah Inland Port Authority, a project that has taken about a decade to come to fruition, state leaders said on Thursday at a ribbon cutting ceremony.
Cox listed the top benefits that such a facility brings to the state — it will get trucks off the road, helping clear the air and exposing roads to less damage; it will make shipping goods easier, lowering prices; and it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the future, he said.

“Smart infrastructure like this improves daily lives for every Utah. It means lower costs at the grocery store, more reliable delivery of critical goods, and a stronger economy rooted right here in our own backyard,” Cox said at the event. “By expanding our intermodal capacity, we’re doing more than just moving freight. We’re strengthening Utah’s role in the global supply chain and boosting our competitiveness for manufacturing and economic development wins.”
  Gov. Spencer Cox speaks at the ribbon cutting ceremony of the new BNSF Railway Salt Lake City Intermodal Facility on July 31, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)
The governor compared his excitement about this opening with how he felt when announcing that Salt Lake City had officially won the bid to host the Olympics in 2034, arguing that the project will be transformative for Utah. Seeing this come to reality is also reflective of the goal he shared with lawmakers in January in his State of the State remarks — the state must build for the future. 
“We knew that the future of Utah depended on a strong manufacturing sector. And to have a strong manufacturing sector, you have to be able to transport goods, and that’s what we’re doing,” he said. “Every shipping container that reaches Utah more efficiently means more opportunity for our rural producers, our urban manufacturers and the workers who keep our state running.”
With the inland port now focusing on “satellite ports” instead of a sole location, the state is studying expanding rail infrastructure in rural areas, Cox said. That’s in addition to the Uinta Basin Railway, which would connect northeastern Utah with national rail lines, facilitating the export of waxy crude oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast, which he added, if court rulings allow the controversial project to move forward “will be a game changer.”
What about rail crossing congestion?
“We can’t keep growing our road system. We have to grow using our rail system, which is totally underutilized right now,” Ben Hart, executive director of the Utah Inland Port Authority, said on Thursday. 
All kinds of goods will travel in those rail lines, from consumer goods to manufacturing and mining products. As discussions on tariffs are still ongoing, the Utah Inland Port Authority wants to capture as much supply chain work as possible in the state, Hart said. 
  New BNSF Railway Salt Lake City Intermodal Facility on July 31, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)
While trucks will be replaced by rail freight, easing congestion on roads, trains can bring other types of traffic disruptions. Railroads have been a well-documented issue for communities on the west side of Salt Lake City, who often spend hours at rail crossings waiting for nearly three-mile-long trains to pass. 
Now that Salt Lake City has tested road signs alerting commuters of crossing wait times, the Utah Inland Port Authority will provide an initial contribution of $150,000 to the city for sensors and equipment to expand the system.
Patriot Rail CEO Brandy Christian said the company will also work with the Utah Department of Transportation and Salt Lake City to deliver a grant to relocate Patriot Rail’s interchange to the new intermodal facility. That move would help decongest the Poplar Grove and downtown neighborhoods. Construction is scheduled for 2026.
“That’s going to be vital, not only to increase the fluidity with this expanded intermodal service,” Christian said, “but also all of the business that we have on the Salt Lake, Garfield and Western Railway.”

While many of the most severe provisions of the budget reconciliation law won’t take effect for another two years, hospitals and health care providers are already preparing for major revenue losses. According to three experts who spoke at a Thursday press conference hosted by national health care advocacy group Protect Our Care, the impact will be higher insurance costs, reduced access to care, and deep economic repercussions.
“The state of Maine will do the best we can and prepare to meet the challenge with what has been passed in Congress,” said Maine Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland). “But it’s going to be extraordinarily difficult for us to be able to make up and to keep the state of Maine moving in the right direction.”

Many low-income households, including unhoused people and veterans, will no longer be eligible for Medicaid, or will have to meet work requirements, which experts have said most people already meet, but the paperwork disincentivizes enrollment and increases the administrative burden on states.
The legislation signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, the so-called “one big, beautiful bill,” could blow a $430 million hole in Maine’s budget and lead to the loss of 4,300 state jobs, according to Protect Our Care’s Maine Director Toby McGrath. The law is also projected to cause a $450 million decline in economic output and a $750 million loss in state GDP. Hospitals are also expected to lose $700 million in revenue, with rural facilities most at risk, he said. 
Brennan emphasized that the damage will extend far beyond those who rely on MaineCare, the state version of the federal health care insurance program. The rollback of coverage will increase the number of uninsured Mainers who rely on emergency rooms for care, he said, services that hospitals often cannot recoup costs for.
Maine already ranks fifth in the country in terms of people using the ER for health care, Brennan said. “And that uncompensated care is going to be transferred and passed along to every person in the state of Maine,” he added.
Brennan noted that during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the expansion that allowed 100,000 people to sign on to MaineCare saved hospitals $125 million in uncompensated care. That expansion also helped improve access to substance use treatment and mental health services statewide — services now at risk under the new law.
Medicaid cuts could cost Maine hospitals $66 million a year, report finds

The Medicaid cuts threaten programs in schools, as well. Brennan, who serves on the Maine Legislature’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, said educators are already seeing rising levels of anxiety, depression, and disruptive behavior among students, and warned that the cuts for mental health services will only worsen those trends.
Charlie Dingman, chair of the Maine Democratic Party and a longtime legal advocate for community health centers, framed the new law as a regressive attack on decades of progress made since the enactment of Medicaid and Medicare under President Lyndon B. Johnson, which saw its 60th anniversary this week.
“We are at a terrible crossroads,” Dingman said. “We are going to see tremendous damage to Maine health care providers. I am impressed with how significantly we will lose access to care in this state.”
Dingman and Brennan both underscored the particular threat to elderly and rural Mainers. About 75% of nursing home residents in Maine rely on MaineCare, and the program is the primary funder of nursing homes statewide. Brennan cited this week’s bankruptcy filing by Genesis Healthcare, which operates 11 facilities in Maine, as a sign of what could become more common.
While some provisions of the bill are delayed until after the midterm elections, Dingman pointed out that some changes — such as defunding reproductive health care providers and reducing Affordable Care Act subsidies — are taking effect sooner.
And although the legislation includes $50 billion to support rural hospitals nationwide, Brennan said that figure falls far short of what is needed to stabilize struggling providers in Maine and elsewhere.

Nectar’s, a linchpin of the local music community and night life in Burlington, is officially closing its doors after a half-century on Main Street. The small, independent music venue served as a springboard for many acclaimed musicians over the years, notably the popular jam band Phish.  
First reported by Seven Days, the downtown staple announced its closure on social media Wednesday. An outpouring of comments offered stalwart support to Nectar’s. 
“Nectar’s will no longer occupy the space that helped shape the soul of Burlington’s music scene,” the company wrote in an Instagram and Facebook post. “While our time at this beloved address is coming to a close, the spirit of Nectar’s will live on.”
The decision came after Nectar’s took a summer hiatus starting June 8 amid waning foot traffic as a result of the ongoing Main Street construction project and public safety concerns in downtown Burlington, the company previously said.
The venue’s owners said they aimed to use the pause to envision a future course for Nectar’s.
“The energy has shifted. And for a small, independent venue like ours, that shift cuts deep,” the company said in Instagram and Facebook posts on May 8. “We believe in what Nectar’s stands for. And we believe Burlington still needs places like this — spaces that nurture creativity, foster community and keep the music alive.”
Nectar’s owners did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

(Montgomery County NY Facebook photo)A New York county legislator has been identified as the person who died after a plane crash at Block Island State Airport Wednesday afternoon.
Montgomery County Sheriff Jeffery Smith confirmed to Rhode Island Current Thursday afternoon that that the victim was Councilor Dan Wilson, who served as chairman of the county’s Physical Services Committee.  
Wilson was 77 years old.
In a Facebook post Wednesday morning, County Executive Pete Vroman described Wilson as “kind, smart, and patient.”

“He was always thinking of ways to assist others and truly defined what it means to be a community servant,” Vroman said in a statement. “He was always thinking of ways to assist others and truly defined what it means to be a community servant.”
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the single-engine Piper PA-28 plane crashed into trees after landing at Block Island State Airport around 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. Three people were on board at the time and all were taken to the Block Island Medical Center and were then flown out of New Shoreham, the Block Island Times reported.
The plane had originally departed from Albany, New York, at around 10:50 a.m. It was owned by Condair Flyers Flying Club in Latham, New York. The group has 75 members who jointly own five aircraft — three Cessnas and two Pipers, according to its website.
A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)investigator was scheduled to arrive on scene late Thursday, an agency spokesperson confirmed in an email. 
The NTSB said it will review flight track data, recordings of any air traffic control communications, aircraft maintenance records and weather reports from around the time of the crash.
The agency spokesperson said the NTSB will also conduct a 72-hour background check on the pilot “to determine if there were any issues that could have affected the pilot’s ability to safely operate the flight.”
​​A preliminary report of the NTSB investigation will be available within 30 days and can be accessed via the NTSB’s investigations database. The agency said it expects to release a probable cause report on the crash in 12 to 24 months.

Three of the people charged say they were working for and paid by Mayor Joe Ganim’s campaign.
The newly unsealed records allege that Robert Anderson, Elsie Mercado and Silvia Ramos illegally collected absentee ballots on behalf of Ganim ahead of the September 2023 primary, which the incumbent mayor won by just 251 votes. All three of those defendants told investigators that they were paid by Ganim’s campaign.
State prosecutors also claim that Maria Hernandez, who was running for a city council seat in the city’s 137th district, illegally collected two voters’ absentee ballots while working in conjunction with John Gomes, Ganim’s Democratic challenger.
Anderson and Mercado did not return phone calls for this story. The Connecticut Mirror could not contact Ramos and Hernandez. None of them have listed defense attorneys yet.  
Ganim and Gomes, who faced off in four consecutive elections in 2023 and 2024, did not return phone calls for this story.

The arrest warrants filed in court this week are the latest criminal charges to emerge out of a sprawling investigation into Bridgeport’s 2023 mayoral race, which was ultimately overturned in court due to widespread allegations of absentee ballot fraud.
Nine people have now been charged with abusing the absentee voting system during that primary, including several sitting city council members and the vice chairwoman of the city’s Democratic Party.
The new criminal complaints shine new light on Bridgeport’s municipal elections, which drew national attention after video surveillance footage emerged in the fall of 2023 depicting numerous campaign operatives depositing absentee ballots into drop boxes throughout the city.
In particular, the arrest warrants cite evidence about how some of these campaign operatives were financially compensated. 
The warrant filed in Ramos’s case, for instance, notes that she received at least $2,600 from Ganim’s campaign and that Ramos told investigators that city councilwoman Eneida Martinez recruited her to be a “chaser” for the Ganim campaign.
The allegations against Mercado similarly state that Ganim’s campaign paid her $8,620 for what they categorized as “consulting.” 
One of the voters who was interviewed by investigators alleged that Ganim himself went door-to-door with Mercado while she was signing up people to vote absentee ahead of the 2023 election.
That voter told investigators that Mercado “entered the apartment while Ganim simply said hello from the threshold of the apartment door and walked away presumably to greet other potential voters in her building.”
It is legal in Connecticut for candidates, campaign workers and political party members to distribute applications for absentee ballots.
But the arrest warrants allege that the actions of the political operatives in the city went beyond that.

Investigators with the Chief State’s Attorney’s office accused the four new defendants of returning to voters’ homes and apartments and illegally taking possession of their absentee ballots, which is commonly referred to as ballot harvesting. 
Mercado repeatedly denied taking possession of other voters’ ballots during an interview with state investigators. And Hernandez claimed she only handled absentee ballots that belonged to her family members, which can be legal.
But the two other defendants admitted to breaking the state’s election laws during similar interviews, which were recorded, the warrants state.
Anderson, who is a city employee, was captured on video surveillance footage alongside Wanda Geter-Pataky, the vice chairwoman of the city’s Democratic party, depositing ballots into a drop box outside the city government center, the warrants state.
When confronted with that video footage, investigators said, Anderson acknowledged depositing roughly 10 ballots into two of the drop boxes in the city.
Anderson did tell investigators that “he worked for, and was paid by the Ganim campaign during the 2023 Primary campaign,” the warrant states.
But he also said that “he was never told by anyone working in the Ganim campaign to pick up ballots.” 
Ramos made similar admissions during her interview.
According to the arrest warrant, Ramos initially said she didn’t pick up anyone’s ballots, but later told investigators that she picked up “one or two.”

She also told investigators that once she picked up those ballots, she would “give ’em to Eneida (Martinez).”
Ramos is not the first person to claim that they were working for Martinez when they harvested voters’ ballots. Margaret Joyce, who was charged previously with absentee ballot crimes, told investigators that she was also working on behalf of Martinez and Ganim.
Martinez has not been charged with any crime as part of the ongoing investigation, and when she was reached by phone on Thursday, she denied having any involvement with Ramos.
“That has nothing to do with me,” Martinez said before referring the CT Mirror to her attorney, John Kennelly.
Kennelly also denied that his client ever took possession of another voter’s absentee ballot. 
“Eneida Martinez has never violated any election laws in any election, and more particularly, has never taken possession of any absentee ballots, nor participated in the collection or return of any absentee ballots,” he said.
“The councilwoman unequivocally denies any inference that she has in any way been involved with any of this unfortunate conduct,” Kennelly said.
But, according to the warrant, city surveillance footage shows Martinez dropping materials into a ballot drop box.
“Ramos gave Eneida Martinez absentee ballots in violation of the law, which may be corroborated by video evidence … of Eneida Martinez’s multiple approaches to a ballot drop box during the 2023 Primary,” the warrant states. 
Martinez asserted her Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination when she was questioned about those videos in court in 2023.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240905_BridgeportDrone_JoeBuglewicz018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 15:57:02.815218
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-31 19:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Family and friends rally as hunger strike at Cheshire continues,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/31/ct-prison-hunger-strike/,A hunger strike at Cheshire Correctional Institution has been gaining supporters as the strikers go into their third week of protest.,"A hunger strike at Cheshire Correctional Institution has been gaining supporters as the strikers go into their third week of protest against what they say are frequent lockdowns, poor food and inadequate medical care. 
The strike, which began with nine people on July 7, has caught the attention of prison reform advocates, who protested outside Cheshire CI on Wednesday evening. According to the Department of Correction, 15 people were striking as of Tuesday, although some of the incarcerated strikers and advocates say the number is over 20. 
Department of Correction officials said they have been monitoring the hunger strike as it has gone on. Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the department, said officials met with the strikers not long after the strike began and that they “continue to meet with the individuals on a regular basis” to discuss their concerns. 
According to Banevicius, five of the original seven strikers have gone back to eating, although others have joined since. 
But Jose Ramos, one of the original members of the hunger strike, said during a phone call with the protestors on Wednesday that a group of the people on hunger strike were brought into the captain’s office on the first day of the strike. He said they were told that the captains did not have the authority to make changes in the facility, and that the inmates would have to speak to the warden or the commissioner. He said he had not spoken to anyone in the Department of Correction since then about the strikers’ demands.  
Ramos also described what he considered retaliation after the strike began, including being separated from the other hunger strikers (he said he was moved to three different units within a week’s time) and that his unit underwent a shakedown by correction officers.

Shyion Singleton, the sister of Rogeau Collins, one of the original hunger strikers, told CT Mirror that her brother was placed in restrictive housing the day after the strike and remained there for two weeks. She said she believed this was in retaliation both for the hunger strike and for a call she made to the Department of Correction the day before. 
“They are just treating the inmates that are on the hunger strike like crap,” she said. 
Singleton said she spoke to her brother and urged him to break his fast, saying she was concerned about his health. She said he is now on a list of incarcerated individuals waiting to be transferred to another prison. 
On July 26, a group of organizations including Stop Solitary CT, New Britain Racial Justice Coalition, Brothers and Sisters in Action, the Guided By Purpose Initiative and a professor from Yale Law School wrote a letter to Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros asking for updates on the condition of the strikers and requesting that the protestors not face retaliation for their actions. 
Banevicius told CT Mirror that all the strikers are being monitored by medical staff and that none have been placed in solitary confinement. He said the department does not “tolerate or engage” in retaliation toward protestors but said the strikers were “expected to adhere to the established rules and regulations designed to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals, including staff and the incarcerated population.”
“The DOC is working to address the grievances of the protesters in a constructive manner while maintaining a safe, secure and orderly environment,” Banevicius said. 
Chief among the reasons claimed for the strike are frequent facility lockdowns, which some say are in violation of the Protect Act, a 2022 law that requires incarcerated individuals to have at least five hours of out-of-cell time each day. 
DeVaughn Ward, the Correction Ombuds, told CT Mirror that Cheshire was on some kind of lockdown five of the seven days of the first week of July. Rashid Sellers, one of the people on the hunger strike, told CT Mirror that the facilities were on a “modified lockdown” from July 3 through July 6, when they received only an hour of recreation in the morning and an hour in the evening. 
The facility was on a modified lockdown for part of the day July 2 and July 3 for the wake and funeral of a corrections officer.
Joseph McCarley, a correction officer at Cheshire and representative of the local officer’s union, said the lockdowns are the result of severe staffing shortages combined with drug-related incidents, known as “code whites.” McCarley said the facility has a large amount of people out on worker’s compensation, as well as officers on administrative leave, sick leave or taking vacation time. He said staff members are pulling double shifts nearly every day or being mandated to work consecutive days.
“ I think staff are doing their best to come to work,” he said. “It’s just, statistically, we have burnout.” 
Banevicius said the department is still trying to recruit new officers. He said that 90 newly hired corrections officers began working in the facilities earlier this month and that an additional 150 will start their first day of training on Aug. 8. 
McCarley denied emphatically that corrections officers were retaliating against incarcerated individuals who were striking. He said the shakedowns were the result of the high amount of drugs present in certain blocks in the facility and the high number of medical emergencies related to drugs. He added that if correction officers have to accompany incarcerated individuals to the hospital because of a medical emergency, that can also leave them short-staffed, causing a lockdown.  
Banevicius said that keeping drugs and contraband from coming into the prisons was “an ongoing battle for correctional professionals.” He said the department “continually reviews its policies, procedures and training methods as part of its commitment to ensure safe facilities.” 
McCarley said he felt hunger strikes were “a form of self-harm” and that the strikers should be transferred to a facility with an infirmary so that they can be monitored more closely for health risks. 
According to McCarley, the 2022 Protect Act, because of its out-of-cell time requirements, has made it more difficult for correction officers to conduct systematic shakedowns and locate contraband. Barbara Fair, the executive director of Stop Solitary and one of the leading authors of the Protect Act, disagreed, saying that the Protect Act does not prevent shakedowns. And she said lockdowns continue to happen at facilities at around the same rate that they did before the law was passed. 
Banevicius told CT Mirror in an email that from July 7 through July 28, there were six full lockdowns, 12 “modified lockdowns” where social visits were still allowed, and five modified lockdowns where visits were not allowed. 
He noted that incarcerated individuals are still able to go to programs and attend medical appointments during modified lockdowns and can often have visits as well.
But several incarcerated individuals complained to CT Mirror about visits being canceled. 
“My family are all from NY and they take the time out [of their] day to drive 3 hours to come and see me. The jail that I’m currently in constantly has been going on lock down without notifying our families, so when my loved ones get here, they have to turn around and go back home without any justifications whatsoever,” said Solomon Taylor, who joined the strike on July 24. 
“Families come up here and are turned around because the amount of time used to clear the codes. It cut in to our visit time. Or most times, they’ll just lock us down and we’ll be kept from seeing our visitor,” said Jarviyan Williams, who joined the strike about a week ago. He added that for people who receive virtual visits because of physical disabilities or long-distance family members, the computers often have technical difficulties, forcing them to reschedule, which can take 1-3 weeks. 
Williams said the lockdowns also often mean the loss of recreational time or showers. 
David Shavers said he joined the strike because of the “obsessive lockdowns” and the fact that he hadn’t been able to access the library to do legal work for months. He also said he felt he’d been treated unfairly by prison staff. 
A handful of advocates, several of whom were formerly incarcerated, protested outside the prison on Wednesday evening in support of the people on strike. Several told CT Mirror that the demands of the strikers echoed their own experiences. 
Shakur Collins, who was released from the Department of Correction in December 2024 after nine years in Cheshire, said he remembers repeated lockdowns at the facility, said that the medical staff were overwhelmed and referred to the kitchen as “deplorable” — infested with rats and cockroaches. (Banevicius said that a pest control specialist has been coming to the facility twice weekly “for quite some time.”) 
J. Sheim Perry, co-founder of the organization Guided By Purpose Initiative, Inc., who was released about three years ago after nearly 30 years incarcerated, including multiple stints in Cheshire, said the inmates were asking for basic things, like recreational time, hot food and medical attention. He also said the facilities didn’t have access to updated legal material, which makes it difficult for incarcerated individuals who are trying to argue their case in court. 
Perry told CT Mirror he remembers being on a hunger strike himself at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institute 15 years ago. 
“Nothing has changed when it comes down to how inmates are being cared for, how they’re being fed, how the recreation is being run,” said Perry.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CHESHIRE-HUNGER-STRIKE-0731-SR-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 16:56:31.388655

(Pool photo by FOX 13)The man charged with murdering a Santaquin police officer last year is now being investigated for attacking deputies at the Utah County Jail, injuring several officers, including one who now has limited vision and requires an eye patch. 
According to an affidavit, 43-year-old Michael Aaron Jayne was being investigated Wednesday for having contraband in his cell, where he is awaiting trial for the murder of Santaquin Police Sgt. Bill Hoosier. If convicted, Jayne could face the death penalty. 
Prosecutors intend to pursue death penalty for man accused of murdering Utah police officer

Deputies escorted Jayne to an interview room, noting that he was originally “polite and respectful,” the affidavit reads. But as they questioned him about the contraband, Jayne’s demeanor quickly changed. 
He “became aggressive and threatening,” police say, jumping out of his chair, pushing the table towards the deputies and taking a fighting stance. As the officers attempted to place him in handcuffs, Jayne “threw a punch towards one of the deputies.” 
The deputy deflected the punch, according to the affidavit, and pinned Jayne up against the wall, where he made “verbal threats to kill” the deputy.  
That’s when Jayne “reached his hand up, knocking the prescription eyeglasses off the deputy’s face. Jayne began clawing at the deputy’s face until he got to his eyes. The deputy indicated that Jayne showed no intent to strike him with his fist, instead he was targeting the deputy’s eyes, attempting to gouge his eyes with his fingers. The deputy indicated that Jayne was able to dig his finger deep into his right eye socket, attempting to dig his eyeball out of his head,” according to court documents. 
After a short struggle, the deputies were able to pin Jayne to the ground. He then grabbed the eyeglasses and tried to stab a deputy in the ribs with the metal. Multiple deputies were soon able to restrain Jayne.

Two deputies were later treated at a hospital and released. The first deputy had skin ripped out from inside of his lower eyelid, a scratch that barely missed his cornea, and swelling and scratches around both eyes. He currently has limited vision in his right eye, and must wear an eye patch, according to the affidavit. 
Another deputy suffered a bone chip in his right elbow and several abrasions, while a third sprained several fingers. 
In May, Jayne was charged in the 4th District Court with nine felonies, including aggravated murder which is a capital crime. Prosecutors say Jayne hit and killed Hoosier, the Santaquin police sergeant, with his semitrailer on Interstate 15, after being stopped for blowing through a stop sign. 
Last fall, Utah County prosecutors announced their intent to seek the death penalty in Jayne’s case, which would require a unanimous decision from a jury — if the jury is not unanimous, a sentence of 25 years to life would be imposed. A hearing is set for Nov. 25. 
Now, following Wednesday’s incident, Jayne could face additional charges, including aggravated assault by a prisoner, a second-degree felony, assault by a prisoner, a third-degree felony, and criminal mischief, a class A misdemeanor, according to the affidavit.

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)New Mexico climate groups struck a defiant tone in the wake of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to dismantle federal authority to reduce one of the drivers of climate change: greenhouse gases.
On Tuesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in Indianapolis that the agency would scrap what’s called the “endangerment finding” established in 2009 under the Obama Administration. In that finding, the agency determined climate change was a threat to human health, which allowed the EPA the power to regulate greenhouse gases.
After the proposal is published, the EPA will solicit public comment over the next 45 days and finalize the rule, most likely within the next year.
The 2009 finding formed the basis for a number of ensuing EPA regulations, including a 2024 rule requiring increasingly strict tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks. In his announcement this week, Zeldin contended the framework established in 2009 hurt the wider economy.
“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in a written statement, claiming that under the Obama and Joe Biden administrations, the EPA “twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year.”
Trump’s EPA proposes rollback of basis for climate change rules, sparking Dem outrage

New Mexico’s top environmental official said the Trump administration’s proposal “ignores decades of established climate science,” and threatens New Mexicans’ health and economy.
“Clean energy means good jobs — thousands of them already here in New Mexico, with more on the way,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement provided to Source NM. “We’ll continue working with lawmakers to ensure New Mexico has the tools we need to keep reducing emissions and growing our clean energy economy, regardless of what happens in Washington. New Mexico will continue standing behind the science and leading on climate action because it protects our families, our economy, and our future.”
In recent years, New Mexico has adopted laws and rules to lower state emissions, including the 2019  Energy Transition Act requiring more renewable energy for electricity generation, and a 2022 law requiring oil and gas producers to lower methane emissions.
New Mexico adopted rules from California to phase-out gas-powered cars and ramp up sales of electric vehicles available for purchase starting in 2026. President Donald Trump blocked the rule in June, prompting a lawsuit from New Mexico and 10 other states that enforce California’s emissions rules.The state is also moving forward in September with rule-making to reduce pollution over time from “cleaner fuels,” following the adoption of the law in 2024.
Currently, the state government is acting under Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s 2019 executive order setting reduced emission goals through 2050. Several lawmakers have introduced measures to enshrine these goals into state law, which have thus far stalled out at the Roundhouse.
‘We’re going to need to see action’ 
New Mexico conservation and environmental groups said the decision, which is not yet final, will roll back progress on clean energy and worsen risk from disasters linked to climate change, and said local governments have to work to fill the gaps.
“The idea that we are turning back 16 years of progress and turning our backs on the detrimental effects of climate change on human existence is heartbreaking,” Carlos Matutes, executive director of GreenLatinos, told Source NM. “We know full well that climate change is impacting the lives of New Mexicans, look no further than the Rio Grande running dry while we have floods in the Southeastern part of the state.”
While New Mexico’s regulations can still continue, the federal government’s move will have a “ripple effect” throughout climate policy, said Kyle Tisdel, an attorney and the Climate & Energy program director at the Western Environmental Law Center.
“This is an abandonment of EPA’s fundamental duty to put the U.S. in the lead in terms of our emissions and our economy going forward, but also to put people first before the oil and gas industry and before the coal industry,” Tisdel told Source NM. “It’s this abdication of the federal government’s fundamental role to do what’s in the best interests of the public.”
The policy will likely be challenged in the courts, said Conservation Voters New Mexico Climate and Energy Advocate Justin Garoutte.
“The Trump EPA’s plan makes blatant climate denial official U.S. policy,” Garoutte said in a statement. “Let’s be clear: eliminating the endangerment finding and methane regulation is a Polluters’ First agenda, allowing the industries responsible for more than 50% of climate pollution in the country to evade regulation.”
The EPA decision to scrap endangerment is “a direct attack” on the health and futures for young people, said Zoey Craft Communications Manager Youth United for Climate Crisis Action.
“The endangerment finding is really one of the few protections that at the federal level acknowledges how harmful these emissions actually are to our health and our futures,” Craft told Source NM. “Rolling it back doesn’t just weaken policy, it ultimately is giving polluters more power, and our communities simultaneously less protection.”
Craft said focus will have to include local responses to extreme-weather disasters.
“When our government won’t step up to protect us, we’re going to have to continue to step up to keep protecting each other,” Craft said.
New Mexicans can participate in local rulemaking hearings and upcoming legislative sessions to put more urgency into reducing emissions, said Nini Gu, the Environmental Defense Fund’s western regulatory and legislative manager.
“New Mexicans should tell their policy makers very clearly how they have been impacted by climate pollution, oil and gas emission and that they are really looking to their governor and state regulators to step in and fill that void left by the federal government,” Gu told Source NM. “The state does not, and should not, wait for a mandate from the federal government in order to step in and protect New Mexicans.”
The decision should spur further action in the governor’s last 30-day session in 2026, said Camilla Feibelman, the director of the Rio Grande Chapter of Sierra Club.
“We are going to need to see action in this coming legislative session, this last 30-day session with this governor, real action, because we’re being left so exposed by the federal government,” Feibelman told Source NM.
Feibelman noted that New Mexico has worked to implement its own methane rules and car  emission even as the second-largest producer of oil and gas and that New Mexico has to “be a leader on climate.”
“People need to remember that we have the power to change things,” she said. “We have the power to change things at home by picking better products and by picking better candidates, who are willing to act on climate.”

The Iowa woman accused in a state audit of stealing close to $400,000 in taxpayer money between 2015 and 2022 has yet to be criminally charged in the case.
In January, Auditor of State Rob characterized the matter as a case of “embezzlement” that involved programs funded by the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by the state agency called Iowa Workforce Development.
The federal money was routed from IWD to the Central Iowa Workforce Development Board, and then to the so-called “subrecipient” of the funds, Children and Families of Iowa, Sand said. At Children and Families of Iowa, administrator Jodi Spargur-Tate headed a program tasked with distributing the funds to Iowans for job-training opportunities.
The auditor’s investigation identified $436,180 worth of improper and unsupported disbursements by Spargur-Tate, some dating back to May 2015.

The questionable spending included $324,586 in payments that were routed to Spargur-Tate herself, according to the auditor’s report. “And then there was about another $100,000 that was diverted to Spargur-Tate’s family members for things like rent, utilities and cellphone service,” Sand said in January.
The alleged embezzlement was uncovered in 2022 when a worker who was filling in for Spargur-Tate during the latter’s vacation noticed one recipient of the funds didn’t have a car but was claiming expenses for auto repairs.
Children and Families of Iowa investigated further and then alerted IWD to the potential issues. That led to the special investigation by the auditor.
Some of the improper payments the audit found were made by Spargur-Tate at Children and Families of Iowa are alleged to include $77,730 that was routed to a relative, Dee Dee Millard, for day care services that were never rendered; $10,014 that went to U.S. Cellular; and $6,167 in payments to MidAmerican Energy.
At the time of Sand’s January announcement, the auditor’s office stated that it had shared its findings in the matter with the Polk County Sheriff’s Office, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, the Polk County Attorney’s Office, and the Iowa Attorney General’s Office.
Since then, no state or federal criminal charges have been filed in the case.
Representatives of the Polk County Attorney’s Office and the Iowa Attorney General’s Office said this week their offices had not received any criminal referral in the case.
Sonya Heitshusen, public information officer for the Auditor of State, said that’s because the matter is in the hands of federal prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Iowa.
It appears charges have not been filed by federal prosecutors because they have yet to make a decision as to whether the case should go to trial, Heitshusen said.
“As I understand it, they’re now finished with their investigation and they are in the process of deciding whether this will be pled out or they will go to trial,” she said.
When asked about the status of the Spargur-Tate case, MacKenzie Benson Tubbs, public information officer for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said that with regard to “any substantive questions, it is safe to assume our office has no comment.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-31 15:57:02.815218

A recently signed New Hampshire law will require doctors to follow patients’ wishes with regard to voluntary sterilization. (Photo by Getty Images)New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.
It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.

Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-31 19:15:23+00:00,Mississippi Today,Son like father: Vernon Dahmer Jr. was a patriot,Jerry Mitchell,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/31/son-like-father-vernon-dahmer-jr-was-a-patriot/,"Column: Vernon Dahmer Jr., the son of a voting rights maryr, was, like his father, a patriot.","The Vernon Dahmer family is one of the most patriotic families in America.
Six of his seven sons served a total of 78 years in the armed forces, and on Wednesday we said goodbye to Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Vernon Dahmer Jr., one of the finest men I’ve ever known.
The first time I met him in 1994, I thought I was gazing at a ghost. He had his father’s distinctive features — a barrel-chested frame, closely cropped hair and a narrowly trimmed mustache across his upper lip.
The more we talked, the more I marveled at the similarities we shared. We had both been named after fathers we admired, and we both had family nicknames. His was “Bo,” and mine was “Boo.”
He led me to a table where he showed me a photograph taken by Chris McNair, whose daughter and three other girls had been killed in 1963 when the Ku Klux Klan bombed a Birmingham church.
The picture showed Vernon Jr., and three brothers, George, Martinez and Alvin. They were dressed in their uniforms, staring at the ashes of what had been their family home.
On Jan. 10, 1966, two carloads of Klansmen launched firebombs into the Forrest County home and the family’s grocery store, where Vernon Sr. had volunteered to let Black Mississippians pay their poll taxes so they could vote. (The state had adopted these taxes in its 1890 Constitution in hopes of barring Black Mississippians from voting.)
Another firebomb hit the family’s 1964 Ford Fairlane, setting it ablaze and causing the horn to stick. Dahmer’s wife, Ellie, stirred to the blare of the car horn, smelling smoke. She yelled out, “Vernon, I believe they got us this time.”
He jumped out of bed and grabbed a shotgun, loaded with double-aught buckshot. He fired back at Klansmen so that his family could escape safely out a back window. Unfortunately, the flames of the fire seared his lungs, and he died later that day.

Vernon Jr. was in the Air Force at the time, defending his country. He flew back home to find his father dead and his family home burned to the ground. “To come home and see what happened was totally devastating,” he said.
He had to handle the horrible details, such as the funeral and finding a new place for the family to live while the curious press swarmed around the cinders. “I didn’t have time to cry,” he told me.
He drove me to the Shady Grove Baptist Church, which his ancestors had started before slavery ended, and led me to a rose-tinted headstone that read, “Vernon Dahmer Sr., March 10, 1908—January 10, 1966.”
“If my dad hadn’t been killed by the Klan, he would have had an opportunity to see his grandkids grow up and enjoy the life that those who killed him are still enjoying,” he said. “He was killed for no reason, no valid reason other than hate.”
Despite that hate, the family had endured. Ellie Dahmer served for a dozen years as election commissioner in a mostly white county, and Vernon Jr. helped found the African American Military History Museum.
Not long after our meeting, he began to get calls from a mystery man who wouldn’t identify himself but said he had information on his father’s case. In 1997, we met that man, Bob Stringer, in a motel room on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. 
Vernon Jr. asked what prompted him to come forward, and Stringer replied, “I saw you and your family on TV. You were saying how that you were sure there were some people out there who knew something vital that could help get the case reopened.”
Those words resonated with Stringer, who shared how he had overheard Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers give the order to kill Vernon Dahmer Sr. “It’s been a deep, dark secret for 30 years,” he said. “It took me so long to handle it.”
Stringer began cooperating with the Forrest County District Attorney’s office and the Mississippi attorney general’s office, which managed to get a copy of the unredacted FBI file on the case. The more than 40,000 pages enabled authorities to piece the case back together.
They met with the Dahmer family, whose quiet courage inspired them to work even harder. After then-Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore spent the day with the Dahmer family, he tucked a photograph of the family in his car visor, a reminder that justice had yet to be done.
In spring 1998, authorities arrested Bowers, who went on trial before summer ended. In previous trials, all-white juries refused to convict, but this time would be different. Vernon Jr. was sitting in the balcony, watching the trial unfold when he finally heard the words he longed to hear: “Guilty.”
He covered his face with his fingers, tears streaming behind his calloused hands. He finally had time to cry.
Back at their home, the family gathered on the front lawn beneath the shade of the towering oaks. Friends drove by. They honked their horns and yelled out in victory.
Before darkness fell, he drove to a quiet cemetery and stared at a familiar rose-tinted headstone that read, “Vernon Dahmer Sr. Husband, Father, Community Leader, Voting Rights Activist.” He fell to his knees, telling his daddy that he could rest in peace now because justice had finally come.
On Wednesday, the man I admired and loved so much was buried in the same cemetery with his father.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/30165018/AP177155159573.jpg,,,2025-07-31 15:57:02.815218

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Brown University recovered its access to more than $50 million in federal grant funding for health and life science research frozen since April by signing a deal with the federal government Wednesday. 
The several strings attached to the bargain include codifying definitions of “male” and “female” in university athletics and housing, aligning with the binary view of gender preferred across President Donald Trump’s administration and executive orders.
“I know there will be immediate questions about the agreement,” Brown University President Christina H. Paxson wrote in a letter to the campus community on Wednesday. 
The Providence Ivy League school struck the agreement to conclude a set of three federal probes over race-conscious admissions, Title VI civil rights violations, and the university’s response to allegations of antisemitism on campus. 
During the probes, Paxson wrote that about eight of the school’s federal contracts were canceled and more than 30 National Institutes of Health grants halted. The school was missing out on about $3.5 million in grant money per week, according to Paxson, which had accrued to over $50 million before the deal was made.  The money will now be reinstated within 30 days, per the agreement. 
The U.S. government will preclude any “civil action or other adverse agency action” related to the claims that spurred the investigations, according to the agreement’s text, but it is still allowed “compliance reviews, investigations, or litigation into Brown’s future admissions practices.” 
Both parties’ “desire to avoid the burdens and risks of protracted litigation” motivated the agreement, according to its text. The handshake also nullifies any admission of fault, wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the university. The Trump administration began investigating in February over a 2024 commencement protest at Brown’s medical school, and expanded to larger civil rights violation claims across the university in April, the Brown Daily Herald reported. 
But to rescue its funding, the typically progressive-leaning university had to make several concessions. Among the agreement’s terms:

A promise that Brown “shall not maintain programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets” or other “unlawful DEI goals.” 
Compliance with Title IX regulations through locker rooms for female student athletes “strictly separated on the basis of sex,” with similar stipulations surrounding dorms and living spaces.
A prohibition on “perform[ing] gender reassignment surgery or prescrib[ing] puberty blockers or hormones to any minor child.” 
A commitment to “support a thriving Jewish community” and strengthen antisemitism prevention efforts, including a new campus climate survey — set to launch by the end of 2025 — that will examine whether students of Jewish ancestry experienced harassment on campus or on social media by their peers or Brown faculty or staff
Annual submissions of admissions data every October to the federal government, including “race, color, grade point average, and performance on standardized tests” for applicants, admitted students, and current enrollees
Student course evaluations collected anonymously at the end of each semester, and then reviewed “to identify any reports of antisemitism,” which will be redirected to the school’s equity office for further action

The full agreement is available on Brown’s website.

Commitment to local workforce development
The agreement does not call for any fines or payments to the federal government. It also specifies that the feds will have no authority over “Brown’s curriculum or the content of academic speech.”
Brown also needs to pay $50 million over 10 years to local workforce development groups, which Paxson wrote “is aligned with our service and community engagement mission.” 
The frozen research funding comprised about 70% of the school’s overall research budget. Paxson wrote that the school would have continued to face “enormous challenges for Brown’s research mission and financial sustainability” if funding had  not been restored. 
The university, Paxson wrote, needed to balance its “legal and ethical obligations” while maintaining academic freedom. 
“By voluntarily entering this agreement, we meet those dual obligations,” she wrote. 
The Trump administration is pleased with the deal. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon wrote in a statement Wednesday evening that the resolution means “aspiring students will be judged solely on their merits, not their race or sex” when applying to Brown.
“The Trump Administration is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions,” McMahon wrote.
Speaking to Laura Ingraham on Fox News Wednesday night, McMahon echoed the sentiment that academic freedom wouldn’t be harmed: “This is no way the administration trying in any way to control what’s taught on campuses…or to in any way impact freedom of speech.”
The Brown deal follows a similar, $200 million bargain last week with Columbia University. Another $175 million pact made earlier this month with the University of Pennsylvania over Title IX violations saw the school’s funding restored and its athletics records updated to remove a transgender athlete’s record. Harvard University, meanwhile, is battling the Trump administration in court over a $2 billion funding freeze over claims that the school failed to protect Jewish students from harassment.   
Trump offered his own take Thursday morning on his platform Truth Social, congratulating Brown on the settlement.
“There will be no more Anti-Semitism, or Anti-Christian, or Anti-Anything Else!” the president wrote. “Woke is officially DEAD at Brown. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said Thursday he received a copy of the letter from Brown Wednesday but had yet to review the agreement reached with the Trump administration.
“We’re going to take a close look at it and make sure it doesn’t raise any issues with Rhode Island law,” Neronha said. “My instinctive reaction is always to fight the president. I think he’s a blackmailer, frankly. Once he goes down that road, like any blackmailer, he could be back.”

Earlier this summer, the Trump administration froze more than $6 billion in education funding, including money for migrant education, after-school programs, English-language programs for non-native speakers and other grants. Congress had already approved the money, but the administration said it wanted to conduct a review of the programs.
The administration announced last Friday it would release the remaining $5.5 billion of the money, after unfreezing $1.3 billion earlier this month.
But for Gomez de la Torre’s program, the damage had already been done: Without the money, it had to shut down this summer.

“We didn’t have enough money left over to carry the program,” said Joram Rejouis, the director of program development for the public schools in Alachua County, which includes Gainesville and is the largest of the 12 counties. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage.”
The program came to a complete halt when Gomez de la Torre’s 11 staff members were offered other positions in the school district. Throughout July, about five dozen migrant children across the 12 counties were without summer services. The funds were supposed to go out before the start of the month.
“It’s going horrendously,” said Gomez de la Torre. “Migrant families depend on us, rely on our system and our help.”
The Alachua County program serves about 1,000 to 1,200 children of migrant workers throughout the year, many in rural farming communities. Each year, roughly 17,000 migrant children are served by programs across Florida.
“It is a very valuable program for a very vulnerable population,” Rejouis said. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.”
Migrant children are less likely to have regular primary care and are more likely to face health conditions such as anemia and high blood pressure. Many migrant families who harvest food in the fields don’t have enough food themselves.
The program also helps with communication and translation among parents, teachers and guidance counselors. “We were their go-to for whenever they needed something,” Gomez de la Torre said. “Now, they don’t have us.”










Stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.

The freeze in funds added to the uncertainty and fear created by the Trump administration’s broader moves to target benefits for immigrants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently announced it had added Head Start to the list of public programs that would be closed to immigrants who are here illegally. After the funding announcement earlier this month, a senior official said the administration had established “guardrails” to ensure the funds are not used “in violation of Executive Orders.”
“It’s anybody’s guess when we’ll come back,” Gomez de la Torre said. “If we’ll come back. If people who chose to retire will return, if their retirement can be rescinded. … Nobody knows exactly how it’s going to play out.”
A similar story is unfolding in California.
The statewide Mini Corps program, run by the Butte County Office of Education, north of Sacramento, connects migrant children at schools and labor camps with bilingual tutors who help them during the school day. Many of the tutors are former migrant children themselves, said Yvette Medina, who oversees the program.
The funding freeze forced the office to lay off around 400 workers statewide, according to spokesperson Travis Souders. Despite Friday’s announcement, the organization is waiting for official word — in writing — before reversing layoffs.
“There’s going to be many students out there who are just going to have another disadvantage to the disadvantages that we already have,” Medina said.
In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, the program was forced to shut down altogether, according to Medina.
Medina grew up in migrant labor camps, following her parents to the fields at 4 a.m. as they picked cherries and grapes before she went to school. Her parents worked throughout the Central Valley, back in Mexico and up and down the West Coast, all the way to Oregon.
“It is devastating,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the migrant program, I know for a fact there’s no way I would have graduated high school.”

Migrant families already are gripped with fear as the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids and arrests, which President Donald Trump insists are focused on those with criminal histories.
“They are terrified,” Gomez de la Torre said. “We had families stop sending kids to school and others who fled the country.”
Ruby Luis, a consultant who helps school districts across Florida identify and enroll migrant students in school, also was a migrant child. Her parents worked in orange groves, at strawberry and Christmas tree farms and produce-packing houses.
Program tutors read books with her and gave her school supplies. The program took her on college tours and she enrolled via a scholarship for migrant children — a first-generation college student. She eventually graduated with a degree in biology.
“Just having even somebody to talk to you about going to college — because you don’t have anybody to talk to about [that],” she said. “Having that support was really impactful.
“To take that away, and then now they just have to navigate it themselves, it creates these barriers,” Luis said. “And it can ultimately leave these children not having access to education.”

MONTPELIER — Economists told Vermont legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Scott that state revenues and forecasts have remained relatively level despite the uncertainty and tumult generated by President Donald Trump and his administration. 
Tariffs and federal budget cuts dominated the conversation at Thursday’s meeting of the Emergency Board, composed of Scott and four state House and Senate committee chairs in charge of the state’s budget and financial policy. 
Overall, state economists increased their expectations for the state’s coffers by about 2%, driven by higher than expected income tax revenues. Vermont’s Transportation Fund, which pays for roads and bridges, was downgraded by just over 2%. 
The relatively cheery outlook took some at the meeting by surprise, given the news coming out of Washington, D.C. The Trump administration’s tariffs have fluctuated constantly, fueling booms and busts in the stock market. The passage of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, with its cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs, has further fueled concerns.

Plus, in this year’s state budget, lawmakers and the administration agreed to plan for contingencies if — or when — federal funding cuts arrive. 
“I feel like we should be preparing differently,” Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, chair of the House’s tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said at the meeting. 
“That’s pretty much what the report says, ‘Don’t get comfortable,’” Tom Kavet, an economist for the Legislature, responded. 
Looking beyond the state’s tax revenue, Jeffrey Carr, an economist for Scott’s administration, addressed the labor market, particularly concerns about what could happen if the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement.

“I don’t know how we’re going to do a roof in this state if we get rid of all the illegal immigrant labor,” he said. 
Agriculture, construction and health care are all economic sectors in Vermont with high rates of undocumented immigrants in the workforce, according to the economists. 
On housing, the state financial experts highlighted some signs that the market could finally be cooling. Five out of 14 counties saw median home listing prices drop year-over-year, Carr said. The number of listings increased in all but one county during that same time period. 
“Maybe the world isn’t going to continue to go quite so crazy in the housing markets,” Carr said.

House Speaker Jason White, one of the most vocal school choice advocates in the state, said under the pavilion at Founder’s Square that his caucus plans to craft legislation in response to the Republican-controlled federal government’s efforts to incentivize “school choice” or “education freedom” – policies that proponents say empower parents to have more control over their children’s education. Opponents say such policies undermine public schools and exacerbate inequality. 
White has said that he favors “universal school choice”, which often refers to policies that allow all households — regardless of income level — to use public education dollars to send their children to private schools or other institutions of their choice, rather than being assigned to public schools based on where they live. 
But his own Republican caucus likely doesn’t support some of those efforts. Instead, legislative efforts to expand school choice will likely center on making it easier for students to transfer between public schools, opting into newly created federal tax credits awarding scholarships to private school students and potentially closing some underperforming schools.

Republican Gov. Tate Reeves also told reporters at the fair that he agrees “wholeheartedly” with White’s school choice push and is generally supportive of any policy that allows parents to become more involved with their children’s education.  
“He’s on the right track in trying to get more opportunities and more options for students,” said Reeves of White’s plans.
The speeches from the two state leaders set the stage for school choice to be a central priority in the 2026 legislative session. Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and other leaders of the 52-member Senate have expressed support for some school choice policies, but the upper chamber has been reluctant to agree to more sweeping proposals. 
Hosemann said at the fair on Wednesday that he personally is in favor of allowing public school students to transfer to other public school districts, a policy commonly called portability. He said he also believes students in F-rated school districts should have the option to transfer to any other district. 
But it’s unclear if the Republican-majority Senate would support the measure. Earlier this year, during the legislative session, the Senate Education Committee killed those two measures. 
Before the next session, White plans to use a select committee on “education freedom” to build consensus for a “big, beautiful bill” that will include the House’s education priorities. 
Last month, White announced that his caucus will propose one sprawling education reform package containing many of the school choice provisions that died last session. 
This is a departure from the piecemeal strategy House Republicans undertook last session, where the chamber passed a series of standalone education bills. Many of the House’s bills either died in the Senate or, in the case of a proposal that would have allowed some Mississippi parents to use taxpayer money to pay for private schools, didn’t come up for a vote on the House floor.
In his Thursday speech, White called for Hosemann to adopt his “education freedom” agenda, which he said aligns with President Donald Trump’s agenda just as much as the lieutenant governor’s newly proposed tax rebate plan.

“Yesterday, I heard the lieutenant governor and some of our folks on the other end of the building wanting to maybe copy President Trump with this idea of tax rebates with some of our surplus,” White said. “Maybe we’re all for that in the House. But I certainly hope we find that same copycat agenda when it comes to what President Trump wants to do on education freedom as well.”
Reeves, when asked by reporters whether he supported Hosemann’s tax rebate, said the lieutenant governor spoke to him about the idea before unveiling it publicly and that it highlights Mississippi’s budget surplus. 
Aside from education and tax policy, Secretary of State Michael Watson said his office next April will roll out a new website where the public can search campaign finance reports and individual donors online, similar to info available to the public in most other states and how the Federal Election Commission’s website operates. 
State law currently allows candidates for state office to file PDFs, or pictures of reports, and handwritten reports on the website. The files are not searchable, and sometimes are illegible, making it difficult for the public to examine who is funding their campaigns. County and municipal candidates are not required to file reports online. 
Watson, the chief administrator of state elections, is pushing for the Legislature to adopt a law that requires all candidates running for office, “from dog catcher to governor,” to file reports online. 
State Treasurer David McRae said that the treasury will begin accepting cryptocurrency in September. McRae told reporters that the state will only be accepting bitcoin for now. 
“This is going to be a great investment opportunity for us,” McRae said to reporters. He’s recently indicated that he’s become more open to crypto due to its decentralized structure.
Attorney General Lynn Fitch announced that recent efforts from her office led to 72 arrests in connection with human trafficking, fentanyl and sex offender crimes. 
Several justices on the state Supreme Court in fair speeches called on the Legislature to improve youth courts across the state. 
When asked about a recent Mississippi Today investigation unveiling allegations from an ex-state corrections department official alleging widespread medical neglect and mismanagement in Mississippi’s prison system, Reeves said he was “comfortable” with the leadership of Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain, but would hold VitalCore, the system’s private medical contractor, accountable if the company fails to meet the terms of its contract.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31120431/3X0A0380.jpg,,,2025-07-31 15:57:02.815218

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)When ticking through the statewide ballot in November, Maine voters will first see a question about changing election procedures before being asked about implementing a red flag law.
This order was determined Thursday when Secretary of State Shenna Bellows held a public lottery to determine the order of the two citizen-initiated referendum questions for the upcoming election.
Maine law requires that questions on the ballot be arranged in a specific order, with carry-over measures from a previous election listed first, followed by people’s veto questions, initiated measures, bond issues, constitutional amendments and then other legislatively proposed referenda. The questions within each of those categories must be arranged in a random order.
Voter ID question
The first question will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?” 
The campaign for this question was launched in April 2024 by the Dinner Table PAC as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at the polls. However, the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January seeks to change additional aspects of Maine election law, such as absentee voting. 
The question posed to voters encompasses the multitude of election law changes included in the petition. Though there was pushback on the wording from the campaign and its proponents, Maine’s highest court gave it the OK in mid-July. 
In addition to legal action, the referendum has also drawn big spending on both sides. 
The “Voter ID for ME” ballot question committee has raised more than $550,000 with half a million of that coming from the national Republican State Leadership Committee PAC, which typically focuses on electing Republican candidates in down-ballot races.
Dinner Table PAC was founded by state Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) and Alex Titcomb, who now serves as “Voter ID for ME” campaign manager, with the goal of electing local conservatives to the Maine Legislature.
Those opposed to the voter ID referendum have collected even more with a group named “Save Maine Absentee Voting” having raised more than $600,000. Additionally, the Democratic Governors Association and the Maine Democrat’s House of Representatives campaign arm each contributed $50,000 to a progressive Washington-based law firm that specializes in voting rights. 
Red flag question
The second question on the ballot will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
The question asks voters if they would like to implement a red flag law, officially called an Extreme Risk Protection Order, which would make it easier to temporarily confiscate one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members. Both gun safety advocates and owners in Maine have emphasized the need for such a law.
The Maine Gun Safety Coalition spearheaded the efforts for this question by collecting more than 80,000 signatures in less than two months. 
Maine currently has a so-called yellow flag law, a weaker provision that allows law enforcement officials to take away guns from someone considered a safety risk to themselves or others after an evaluation from a mental health professional. If the referendum passes, it would not replace Maine’s current law, but would be an additional tool police or the general public can use to temporarily confiscate weapons.
A group opposed to the referendum connected with the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine reported it raised more than $12,000 as of mid-July. 
Currently, 21 states have adopted a red flag policy. A red flag proposal introduced in the Maine Legislature in the wake of the 2023 Lewiston mass shooting advanced out of committee but never was voted on by the full House or Senate.
Though the question hasn’t raked in as much cash as the voter ID initiative, it caused somewhat of a kerfuffle late in the legislative session. Before sending it to voters, lawmakers were required to hold a public hearing on the bill associated with the referendum. As adjournment neared, Republicans pushed for the hearing that was eventually held the final days of the session. 
Some gun rights proponents, including the Sportsman’s Alliance, wanted to put a competing measure on the ballot that could potentially have drawn some voter support from the red flag question. However, that proposal, which sought instead to beef up the current yellow flag law, required a work session to be introduced, which the Judiciary Committee declined to hold before adjournment.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.
It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.
Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts, and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women, and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

State Rep. Houston Gaines, an Athens Republican, announced a bid for Congress Thursday, aiming to replace Congressman Mike Collins, who is running for U.S. Senate.
First elected in 2018, Gaines represents part of liberal Clarke County, home of the University of Georgia, as well as portions of more conservative Barrow, Jackson and Oconee counties. If he is successful in next November’s election, the 30-year-old will inherit Congressional District 10, which reaches farther into central Georgia and west into a piece of metro Atlanta.
  Rep. Houston Gaines. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Gaines is vice chair of the House GOP caucus and of the House Appropriations Committee.
“I’ve been on the frontlines in Georgia taking on the far left – now it’s time to take the fight to D.C. and help President Trump continue to deliver for the American people,” Gaines said in a statement announcing his candidacy.
The Athens native pushed for bills targeting so-called sanctuary cities in the wake of Laken Riley’s murder on the UGA campus in 2024 and to punish cities that lower police budgets in response to the social justice movement that followed the murder of George Floyd in 2020.
Gaines’ most recent financial disclosure with the Georgia State Ethics Commission shows his campaign with more than $900,000 cash on hand.
Gaines is the first Republican to announce for the seat and a strong contender, but with no incumbent in the race, it could become a crowded field.
Democrat Lexy Doherty, an education consultant from Athens who challenged Collins in 2024, announced her candidacy in May with a platform emphasizing affordability and protecting government services.
The district was drawn to favor a Republican – Collins beat Doherty 63% to 34% last year and defeated Democrat Tabitha Johnson-Green in 2022 without the advantage of incumbency.

The “batch and build” installation of saturated buffers and bioreactors, led by Heartland Co-op, will help to improve the Middle Cedar watershed by keeping nutrients in the fields, according to IDALS. 
IDALS has worked with Heartland Co-op, based in Clive, on a number of water quality improvement projects, including two that are also under construction and two more that are being planned, with a slated construction start of 2026.

The “batch and build” model means multiple projects, in the case of the latest project 14 saturated buffers and four bioreactors, are designed and built at once rather than individually. It is more efficient and allows more water quality projects to get done at once.


Edge-of-field practices:
— Saturated buffers: an area of vegetation between cropland and waterways, usually where a tile line drains, that helps absorb nutrients from water before it drains into a stream.
— Bioreactors: a trench buried on the edge of a field at a tile outlet and typically filled with woodchips that allow microorganisms to remove nitrates from the water and instead release them as nitrogen gas.


Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said it shows how “more water quality progress” can be made, and more efficiently, when partners work together. 
“We’re proud of this project and we want to keep building the momentum by adding even more farms, practices and project partners in the years ahead,” Naig said in a statement. 
Naig said the Iowa Seed Association and the Iowa Nutrient Research and Education Council were also partners on this project, and others targeting priority watersheds in the state. A spokesperson for the department said the construction contract, with Laser Precision, totals around $200,000. 
The department recently launched another project in Beaver Creek watershed, with an estimated total cost of $1.9 million. 
IDALS is providing technical support and cost-share assistance for installation of the practices. According to a release from the department, there are no out-of-pocket costs for landowners participating in the project.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)University of Florida attorneys are asking the Florida Supreme Court to rehear a student’s legal demand for the flagship university to rebate all or part of student fees charged while campus was on COVID-19 lockdown.
After a trial court and First District Court of Appeal disagreed about the extent of the university’s sovereign immunity from suit, the Supreme Court in its first look at the case on July 17 quashed the decision, concluding the parties hadn’t presented “arguments sufficient to provide a basis for a decision regarding the scope” of the legal shield.
UF is asking the Supreme Court to set a fresh hearing so the parties can speak to that specific question at hand. If the justices aren’t ready rehear it, UF is asking the case be sent back to the First District.
Anthony Rojas, then a graduate student at UF, filed a class action in 2021 seeking to reclaim the fees he and other students paid during a virtual learning period. 
The case originally hinged on whether Rojas reasonably could’ve expected to receive the services allegedly promised — in other words, whether paying the fees created a legally enforceable contract. 
But the justices said they needed more information about the scope of the university’s sovereign immunity. Earlier, the state argued that state entities enjoy sovereign immunity “unless general law clearly and unequivocally provides otherwise. Even then, language allegedly constituting waiver is to be construed narrowly and in favor of the state.”
The university asks the Supreme Court to rehear it because “cases similar to this one from nearly all district courts of appeal currently pend before this court or in the district courts of appeal” and “because this issue implicates sovereign immunity and separation of powers, this court should address it at this stage of the litigation.”

Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media website, Tuesday that Grassley “could solve the ‘Blue Slip’ problem we are having with respect to the appointment of Highly Qualified Judges and U.S. Attorneys, with a mere flick of the pen.”
The “blue slip” process has been used in the Senate Judiciary Committee since at least 1917 to give senators the ability to weigh in on U.S. circuit and district court nominations from their home states, signing off on the nominees using a piece of blue paper before they can advance. If the senators do not sign off, they can effectively block the nominee from being appointed.

Trump said the process has caused “ironclad stoppage of Great Republican Candidates” from Democrat-led states like California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Because of this process, the president said, he has to nominate a Democrat or “a weak and ineffective Republican” for these positions in order for their appointment to advance.
“Senator Grassley must step up, like Crooked Joe Biden did, when he openly broke, at least two times, the “Blue Slip” SCAM, and like others have done over the years, and let our Great Republican Judges and U.S. Attorneys BE CONFIRMED,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He should do this, IMMEDIATELY, and not let the Democrats laugh at him and the Republican Party for being weak and ineffective. The Democrats have broken this ridiculous custom on us, it’s time that we break it on them. Chuck, I know you have the Courage to do this, DO IT!”
But in Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee meeting, Grassley said he was “surprised” by Trump’s comments. While “the people in real America don’t care about what the ‘blue slip’ is,” the process is something that deeply impacts their state’s judicial systems, he said.
“I was offended by what the president said, and I’m disappointed that it would result in personal insults,” Grassley said.
A spokesperson for Sen. Grassley’s office released a statement saying Grassley, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has used the process to advance nominees from states represented by Democrats in the U.S. Senate.
“Chairman Grassley has already successfully moved U.S. Attorneys through committee who have received blue slips from Democrats, including Senators Warner and Kaine of Virginia and Klobuchar and Smith of Minnesota,” the spokesperson said. “When a nominee comes out of committee all 100 senators have a say on the nomination and part of their consideration is based on the home state senators’ input.”
Democrats have also defended the process. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, who chaired the committee during former President Joe Biden’s tenure, had also resisted 2023 calls from to end the “blue slip” process so more nominees could be appointed. Durbin, now ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, thanked Grassley for also defending the custom, saying “I hope it continues to be the case.”

A recently signed New Hampshire law will require doctors to follow patients’ wishes with regard to voluntary sterilization. (Photo by Getty Images)New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.
It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

Stephanie Bice attends a remembrance ceremony on April 19, 2025, on the 30th anniversary of the Murrah Building bombing in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma Republican U.S. Rep. Stephanie on Wednesday night defended her use of remote town halls after a constituent on the call confronted her and accused her of dodging voters.
The question came during a telephone town hall event featuring Republican Reps. Jason Smith, of Missouri, and Bruce Westerman, of Arkansas, who each chair a House committee.
“Without dodging my question or giving me the okey doke, can you tell me why you are not holding in-person town halls, where you can look your constituents in the face, eye-to-eye, and answer tough questions?” the caller said.
“These town halls, telephone town halls, are a joke, and are screened, carefully screened. I had to pretend to be asking another question. I would have never gotten this question in,” the caller added.
Bice was quick to respond, saying this is the 30th telephone town hall she has hosted, and that she speaks with her constituents in the district and in Washington, D.C., all the time.
“Let me make this very clear: I can reach several thousand constituents when I dial out for these telephone town halls. I am never going to get that kind of engagement if I’m doing in-person town halls. I am lucky to get a couple hundred, and that’s on a great day,” Bice said. “I do not dodge my constituents.”
She said the telephone format also allowed her to have “expertise,” such as Westerman and Smith, join in to help answer questions about the reconciliation bill that Republicans recently passed.
“I take offense to the idea that you think I’m dodging questions, because that’s not the case, and frankly, I’m glad you asked,” Bice added. “Especially for my senior citizens that are across the district, they have the opportunity to sit in their homes, listen to the answers that are being given and understand what’s happening in D.C., other than having to drive to a location, especially in the evening during the winter months in the dark.”
Republicans faced backlash and angry crowds this year at both remote and in-person town halls due to Department of Government Efficiency cuts underway in Washington. It prompted the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Rep. Richard Hudson, to advise Republicans to host online events instead. Democrats used the opportunity to host town halls in states and districts dominated by Republicans, which they plan to continue doing to speak against the reconciliation bill.
But the bit of criticism Wednesday night isn’t deterring Bice from hosting more telephone town halls.
“I do these because they are effective, and I will continue to do them,” Bice said. “You will see me doing many more every month as long as I can do them.”
Bice, Westerman and Smith spent most of the hour-long event answering questions about what was included in the reconciliation bill and how it may affect Americans. The first question, however, was from a constituent curious about Bice’s stance on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files.
Bice called Epstein a disgusting individual whose conduct was morally reprehensible and clarified that she had not voted to block the release of the files. Her line in the sand, she said, is ensuring the victims of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell have their identities protected in any files that are released.
“These young girls who were victimized by these horrible individuals deserve privacy in this situation, and for me, that’s paramount,” Bice said. “However, we can provide transparency to the American people and still protect those individuals that were victimized in these horrible acts.
“I think that you will see us discuss this when we return to Congress in September, provided that Secretary Bondi or others don’t already release this information,” Bice added.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.

“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)Only a dozen states have laws establishing suicide prevention offices or coordinators, and just 11 have task forces or committees dedicated to suicide prevention efforts, according to a new report.
The report comes amid sweeping cuts at federal agencies that offer mental health support. They include significant slashes in staffing and funding at the nation’s largest mental health and substance use agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to fold SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America.
Released last week, the report was conducted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials with support from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The analysis is part of an online resource breaking down details of suicide prevention efforts at the state level.


As of Jan. 1, just a dozen states had offices or state coordinators focused on suicide prevention: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Some states have these offices mandated by law and others were established through executive orders.
Eleven states (Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah and Washington) plus Puerto Rico have laws requiring a task force, commission or advisory group focused on suicide prevention.
The report notes prevention efforts are most effective when they are focused on higher-risk populations, areas, age groups and occupations. Suicide risk is higher among rural residents, older adults, American Indian and Alaska Native people, people with disabilities, veterans and groups that identify with a sexual minority. The federal administration recently pulled the plug on LGBTQ+ specialized supports under the national suicide hotline, 988.
About 60% of states — 29 states and Washington, D.C. — have laws that establish some form of fatality review committees that specifically include suicide deaths in reviews. Areas of focus varied among the states. Some had statewide teams and others were on the local level, according to the report.
The report notes that another 11 states assign prevention responsibilities within other offices. Minnesota law, for example, assigns such tasks to the state commissioner of health, rather than toward a special suicide prevention office or coordinator.
In 2023, the nation saw 49,000 deaths by suicide, according to the CDC. Firearms are involved in more than half of suicides.

Two separate school cell phone bans are in the works, one in the Senate spearheaded by state Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) and a House version crafted by state Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester).
Polehanki’s bill has already passed in the Senate, while Tisdel’s bill died on the floor last week. Several members of the House Republican caucus were either absent or voted against the bill, leaving House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) to rely on the chamber’s Democrats to save it.
They did not, with each member of the House Democratic caucus voting against the bill. Hall fumed afterward, claiming he had been working with House Democrats on a deal to get bipartisan votes on the measure. He then removed state Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) from his post as the minority vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Days later, Tisdel told Michigan Advance that he was rewriting the bill and taking out some of the concessions he claimed he made with House and Senate Democrats to soften it, and would instead seek a total bell-to-bell school day ban on the use of cell phones or other wireless devices.
Polehanki, however, said Thursday that there was never a deal and that placing blame on the Democrats for the bill’s failure in the House was inaccurate. She said the issues with the bill had more to do with its content than politics.
“Despite his comments to the contrary, Rep. Mark Tisdel does not have a ‘deal’ with the Senate on his legislation to address cell phones in schools,” Polehanki said in a statement. “He and I have an agreement on the need to address the issue and are trying to work together on it. But we differ on the details and more work is needed to find common ground.”
  State Sen. Dayne Polehanki (D-Livonia) speaking on the Senate floor. June 26, 2025 | Screenshot
In a statement to the Advance, Tracy Wimmer, chief communications strategist for House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton), said that when Tisdel’s bill came up for a vote last week, it was the caucus’ understanding that Polehanki expected movement on her legislation and not the House version.
Wimmer said Polehanki’s bill was far less restrictive and had the endorsement of school groups.
“We are absolutely supportive of helping schools develop policies that can mitigate the damage cell phones are demonstrably doing to the learning experience, and look forward to an opportunity to take up the Senate version of the bill,” Wimmer said. “It is unfortunate that Rep. Tisdel is choosing to point fingers at the minority party for the failure of his bill instead of at his own caucus leadership, who put up a bill they knew did not have enough support in or outside of the chamber to pass.”
On the alleged broken deals with Democrats, Wimmer echoed Polehanki in saying that the caucus was responsibly vetting Tisdel’s bill, and that when it became clear that school groups had ongoing issues with his House Bill 4141, members made the decision to oppose the bill unless a compromise was reached.
A deal was not reached, and House Democrats changed their minds.
“Changing one’s mind after receiving new information isn’t political – it is the backbone of rational, mature thinking,” Wimmer said. “Anyone who thinks otherwise should perhaps consider a less complex and nuanced career field.”
Polehanki on Thursday also detailed what was different between her Senate Bill 234 and Tisdel’s bill.
“His legislation aims to set different parameters for different grades – complicating the implementation, takes away flexibility and independence from schools, and most importantly, disregards exceptions for emergencies,” Polehanki said. “My bill has passed the Senate, and with strong bipartisanship, and I am committed to reaching an agreement on this topic in both chambers.”
That said, a spokesperson for Tisdel’s office told the Advance that his bill did include an exemption for emergencies.
One of the main holdouts on the House version of the cell phone ban was state Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers). 
In an interview with the Advance on Tuesday, Carra said he thought the policy is great for a local community to pass on its own, but he didn’t agree with a one-sized-fits-all mandate for the state.
“I’ve applauded many of the school districts in my community who have already made that decision, and they have seen good results from the decision they have made,” Carra said.
As it stands with the politics of the House, Carra, who is routinely cited as one of the most conservative members of the chamber, said there was certainly a dynamic of trying to gridlock or stifle some members if the Republican caucus didn’t have 56 votes to pass a measure on its own.
“I just want to focus on what we think is best and constitutional, and keeping it straightforward,” Carra said. “I think voting what is right, as opposed to what the caucus wants me to vote for, is what I’m called to do as a legislator.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2158370531-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 14:56:46.069916

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The city of Miami’s proposal to delay its general municipal election scheduled for this November until next year without voter approval has been ruled unconstitutional by Florida’s Third District Court of Appeal.
In its ruling Thursday, the court upheld a lower court’s ruling that the city had violated both its own charter and the Miami-Dade County Home Rule Charter when it voted last month to postpone the November 2025 mayoral and commission election.
On June 26, the Miami City Commission passed an ordinance delaying the balloting for one year, until November 2026, on a 3-2 vote, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez signing the ordinance into law. The move extended the terms of Suarez and a sitting commissioner beyond their term limits.
Advocates argued the change would align with statewide elections, lowering costs and increasing voter turnout. But critics, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier, maintained it was a power grab giving elected officials an extra year in office without accountability to the voters.
Mayoral candidate Emilio Gonzalez filed a lawsuit on June 30, and Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Valerie Manno Schurr ruled in his favor on July 21.
“[T]he City may not enact an ordinance which effectively amends its Charter without submission of the issue to the will and vote of its constituents by referendum, as required by both the City and the Miami-Dade County Charters. Therefore, as the trial court properly declared, the Ordinance is unconstitutional,” the court wrote in its opinion.
Making the same points that Miami officials made about saving money and increasing voter turnout, the city of St. Petersburg changed the date of its municipal election from November 2025 until November of 2026, but only after that change was approved by the voters in a charter amendment in 2022.

Sanders’ goal in Israel, a country she has visited multiple times, is “to meet with government officials and business leaders and deepen Arkansas’ economic ties,” she said in the announcement. In the UAE, she plans to “continue our effort to bring more foreign investment and jobs to Arkansas,” she said.
Sanders’ father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, is the U.S. ambassador to Israel.
The trip, from Aug. 3 to Aug. 9, will be Sanders’ fifth international trade mission since she took office in January 2023. Most recently, she visited France and Switzerland in June, and her meeting with American technology company L3Harris in France resulted in the company’s six-figure investment in a rocket motor production campus in Camden, a South Arkansas hub of defense contracting.
According to the news release, expanding Arkansas’ defense industry will be a primary focus of Sanders’ trip to both Israel and the UAE. In Israel, she will “host roundtables with Israeli companies focused on agritech and defense, and meet with several companies that already have investments in Arkansas.” She also plans to meet with aerospace companies in the UAE.
Sanders will also visit Israel’s Western Wall and Judea and Samaria, according to the news release. A new state law requires state agencies to use the term “Judea and Samaria” instead of “West Bank” in official government documents.
Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories, including Gaza and the West Bank, has recently drawn backlash from members of Congress as starvation has spread throughout the occupied land and the Palestinian death toll has continued to grow.

The state’s annual tax holiday runs from Friday through Monday night. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced this year’s tax holiday during a news conference Wednesday at the Meadowbrook Mall in Bridgeport, West Virginia. 
“The upcoming sales tax holiday period is a chance to put hard-earned dollars back into the pockets of West Virginians,” Morrisey said in a news release. “I hope everyone gets the chance to get out, support local businesses, and get ready for the upcoming school year.”
The tax holiday will cost the state about $3.4 million, according to a news release from the governor’s office. 
Morrisey said the tax holiday should be just the beginning and that the state should do a lot more “as we’re getting our financial house in order.”
“We need to keep returning money back to the people,” he said in a video message posted to social media. He said during the news conference Wednesday the state’s income tax should be lower than all its surrounding states. 
According to the state tax division, the following items are exempt from the state sales and use tax during the weekend:

Certain clothing with a purchase price of $125 or less
Certain laptop and tablet computers with a purchase price of $500 or less
Certain school instruction material with a purchase price of $20 or less
Certain school supplies with a purchase price of $50 or less
Certain sports equipment with a purchase price of $150 or less.

More information and a more detailed description of items eligible for the tax holiday is available online at the tax division’s website. 
The tax holiday begins at 12 a.m. Friday and continues until 11:59 p.m. Monday.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
Americans haven’t saved for retirement. States are creating automatic savings plans.

“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

,California,2025-07-31 17:46:32+00:00,CalMatters,The Supreme Court criticized California development fees. A new court ruling just upheld them,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/07/homebuilding-development-fees/,"An El Dorado County property owner for years has fought a $23,400 traffic mitigation fee that he was charged for building a single home.","In summary
An El Dorado County property owner for years has fought a $23,400 traffic mitigation fee that he was charged for building a single home.


A panel of California appellate judges just pumped the brakes on what could have been a revolution in municipal budgeting and building fees across California.
The constitutional skirmish dates back to 2016 when George Sheetz, proposing to build a house on his property, sued El Dorado County over a $23,420 traffic mitigation fee.
Sheetz and his attorneys argued that the county needed to prove that the five-digit traffic impact fee matched the financial toll his new home would actually leave on local roads. 
The case made its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, which sided unanimously with Sheetz — at least in principle. The court ruled that local governments, including county boards of supervisors, need to justify their impact fees. But it stopped short of saying how detailed they need to be. 
In a ruling published Tuesday, a three-judge panel at California’s 3rd Appellate District took up that question and ruled that the county’s fee passed muster, even under the higher degree of scrutiny demanded by the Supremes. 
El Dorado County “used a valid method for imposing the (traffic) fee” and “established a reasonable relationship between the fee charged and the projected burdens,” the judges wrote. 
Translation: Good enough. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last year, construction boosters heralded a possible new dawn of lower impact fees, while local government groups warned of slashed budgets. This latest ruling has put all of that on hold for now. 
Locally imposed impact fees in California are nearly three times the national average, according to a UC Berkeley report that used data from 2015.
Brian Hodges, attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which represented Sheetz, said they were still weighing whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
But he also stressed that though the ruling didn’t deliver the outcome he and his client were hoping for, the U.S. Supreme Court’s order from last year still makes a wide swath of locally imposed requirements on builders in legal jeopardy. That includes impact fees, but also inclusionary zoning rules, in which cities require developers to set aside a certain share of new units for lower-income tenants.
“We won the war but lost the battle,” Hodges said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Housing-Crocker-Village-MG-CM-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-31 13:57:37.218996

He played in the orchestra, and he advocated for health care for all, regardless of immigration status, on Connecticut’s biggest political stage.
“I helped Esdras build his testimony when talking about Husky 4 Immigrants’ campaign. I helped him write all of it,” said Melany Yunga, fellow CT Students for a Dream member. “When he wrote it, I know he felt inspired.”
Esdras’ testimony urged health care access for everyone in Connecticut, and it was submitted to the state legislature’s appropriations committee.
“He was the kind of person that just cared for everyone and wanted to fight for everyone,” Yunga said. “He just wanted the world to be fair and right. He wanted justice.”

Now, just months later, Esdras is being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In a statement, federal immigration officials confirmed to CT Public that Esdras was detained by ICE last week while working at a car wash in New Haven — something the Trump administration says is part of its immigration crackdown.
“Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to protect public safety, national security, and economic stability while rescuing individuals who may be victims of labor trafficking or exploitation,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in the statement.
Yunga said these tactics had been top of mind.
“He was worried when everything started. Everyone was worried. It was not just him,” Yunga said. “Every member of the organization was worried, and yeah, he lived in fear, just like almost everyone here … in Connecticut.”
CT Students for a Dream and its partner organizations have created a deportation defense fund to help with Esdras’ legal fees. Yunga and other members of the student-led organization also rallied at Esdras’ high school campus Wednesday to bring awareness to his case.
In addition to the students, teachers and faith leaders came and spoke to the crowd of more than 100 people in the high school parking lot. Rev. Josh Williams is the lead pastor at Elm City Vineyard Church.
“Looking at the scriptures that I believe in, that I care about, and seeing on the pages, it says, ‘Care for foreigners, and care for them as if they were citizen-born,’” Williams said.
Esdras first came to the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor from Guatemala during the Biden administration, according to ICE. Now, the 18-year-old has been moved from ICE holding facilities in Massachusetts to Louisiana.
“We’re talking about a high school junior. We have to have that sink in,” Williams said. “Do you remember what it’s like to be a junior? What were your problems then? What were your worries? Was it being picked up by ICE and not knowing where you would be — that day, days later, almost a week later? Remember what it was like and have compassion. That’s what we’re asking for: common sense compassion.”

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez visited the Otero County Processing Center on Wednesday, where U.S.Immigration and Customs Enforcement incarcerates the majority of its detainees in New Mexico.
His visit occurred as Democratic members of Congress push for more access to and oversight of ICE detention facilities. While Vasquez was allowed access inside Wednesday, according to a news release from his office, he said he was not allowed to speak with ICE detainees despite his “lawful right to congressional oversight” and submitting privacy reports ahead of his visit. 
In a statement, Vasquez said he is “all for measures that keep our borders and communities secure, but after my visit to the Otero Processing Center, it is only more clear that ICE is not making our communities safer.”
Convicted criminals make up less than half of ICE arrests under Trump

According to the latest data compiled by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, Otero’s average daily population is 843 ICE detainees,an increase of about 35 inmates since January.
Vasquez’s office said more than 80% of detainees at Otero have no criminal charges or convictions. The national average of ICE detainees without criminal charges or convictions is 71%, according to TRAC data. 
In addition to not being allowed to speak to detainees, Vasquez reported that ICE officials were “unwilling and unable” to provide clear answers about their treatment of detainees.
He also said inmate phones were broken and toilets would not flush. 
Two other New Mexico centers hold ICE detainees. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich visited the Torrance County Detention Center in June and reported “inadequate” and “inappropriate” conditions there. 
The Cibola County Detention Center in Milan is also in Vasquez’s district. He last visited in January 2024, where he decried “privately-run immigration centers” that “have a history of abuse and neglect that must be addressed.” 
U.S. Sen. Heinrich: Torrance ICE lockup ‘inadequate’ and ‘inappropriate’

Vasquez’s spokesperson Delaney Wehn told Source New Mexico in a text message Thursday that Vasquez has not tried to enter the facility yet during President Donald Trump’s second term in office. She declined to comment on whether he intended to.
All three New Mexico detention centers are detaining rising numbers of ICE detainees, according to TRAC. The recently enacted “Big Beautiful Bill” act greatly increases the ICE budget for immigration enforcement and detention, so immigrant advocacy groups in New Mexico expect the numbers to continue to rise.
Torrance’s average daily population of ICE detainees is 435, and Cibola’s is 227. That figure represents a rolling average based on the average number of detainees held each day divided by the number of days since Oct. 1, when the federal fiscal year began.
While no members of the New Mexico delegation have reported being turned away at ICE detention facilities, other members of Congress have said they’ve been denied access.

Concerns about detainee conditions and lack of transparency prompted Democratic lawmakers to sue the Trump administration on Wednesday.

The supposed distinction is sometimes equated with “legal” or “illegal” entry into the U.S. It’s sometimes likened to waiting in line versus cutting the line.
This framework does not reflect reality. The experience of countless immigrant families in the U.S. shows there is no unambiguous division between right and wrong ways to immigrate.
Certain individual cases might map onto a straightforward conception of good and bad. Some people have filled out paperwork and waited years for authorization before crossing the border. Others have snuck across with criminal intent. It is also true that a country has a right and obligation to control the flow of immigration across its borders.
But for millions of immigrants, whose journey to America involved extreme hardship, outmoded laws, dysfunctional bureaucracies, complicit American employers and life or death decisions, reality refuses to fit into tidy policy abstractions, and it defies simple notions of right and wrong.

For years, U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans has told the story about how his grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico “the right way … the legal way.” The Fort Lupton Republican, who represents Colorado’s 8th Congressional District in Congress, leveraged the story to boost his credibility as he endorsed President Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportations. He contrasted his own family’s purported “right” immigration story with the “wrong” one of millions of U.S. residents to argue they deserve to be deported.
“You need to go stand in that line and do it the right way, do it the legal way, so you are not leapfrogging over those folks like my grandfather, who did it the right way and did it the legal way,” he said in January.
But as Chase Woodruff, Newsline’s senior reporter, discovered through a search of public documents, Evans’ grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, entered the U.S. with his family without authorization and lived unlawfully for many years in El Paso. He was once arrested for an immigration violation and faced deportation proceedings.
Woodruff’s investigation was news because Evans had made the false story about his grandfather, who died in 2014, central to his support for a cruel federal policy that is causing immense harm to families and communities across the country. But the real falsehood was not that Chavez had immigrated the wrong way. It was that it was ever so easy to define what the wrong way even is.
Immigrating to America is very hard to do. Even immigrants who follow strictly legal paths to U.S. residency face a monster bureaucracy of restrictions and complexity, and even those legal paths are part of a system that American lawmakers of all stripes admit has been broken for decades.
For too many migrants, the journey is more than hard — it’s fatal. The U.S. southern border is among the deadliest land migration routes in the world. Last year almost 1,300 migrants in the Americas died or went missing, most of them at the U.S.-Mexico border. A stretch of the border along New Mexico and west Texas is especially deadly for migrants, according to a joint investigation by Source New Mexico and The Texas Tribune. From January 2023 to August 2024, 299 human remains were reported in the region, known as the El Paso sector.
But many people decide that the journey is worth risking, because conditions in their home country are too difficult or impossible. They might be motivated by economic destitution, political violence, crime or a natural disaster, against which points of administrative rectitude can appear petty or misplaced. The way that a representative in the U.S. House labels “wrong” could be the only way an immigrant has found to keep loved ones alive. Sometimes the choice is not between right and wrong but between wrong and death, which is hardly a choice.
Chavez was 5 years old when his mother took him and five siblings across the border to El Paso in December 1929. Chavez’s father had died only two months earlier, records obtained by Woodruff show. The family settled in El Segundo Barrio, an El Paso district that one resident, Chicano poet Lalo Delgado, described as a “square mile of poverty and misery.” But despite difficulties the Chavezes immigrated based on the same factors immigrants must weigh today.
“My family fought tooth and nail for the American dream so that future generations like me could have a better life,” Evans himself has said.
Cuauhtemoc Chavez went on to serve honorably in World War II and earned U.S. citizenship in 1946. He was later president of a union representing civil service workers at Fort Bliss in Texas. America is better off for his presence in the country.
After Newsline published Woodruff’s investigation last week, Evans — who declined to speak with Newsline about the story — seemed to acknowledge that rigid moral categories resist application to human beings struggling to survive and thrive.
“I think I’ve always talked about doing it the ‘right way,’ which is in reference to the fact that (my grandfather) joined the military and served his country,” Evans said when questioned by a CPR reporter about Woodruff’s findings.
In other words, what immigrants contribute to their adopted country can outweigh the infractions of their arrival, and the totality of their experience can overcome particular episodes of blame. The Trump administration’s immigration policy would be a lot more humane, and it would better serve America, if it operated under the wisdom of this insight.

“In 1929, my grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, arrived in the United States from Mexico,” Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, said in a 2022 statement to the Spanish-language newspaper La Prensa de Colorado, made when he was a first-time state House candidate. “Together with his mother and siblings, they came in search of the American dream.”
The statement to La Prensa stands out as a rare instance in which Evans publicly referred to his great-grandmother, Luz Garcia Chavez. It was with Luz that the Chavez family’s pursuit of the American dream began, nearly two decades before Cuauhtemoc’s naturalization in 1946. He was just 5 years old on Dec. 9, 1929, when Luz, a young widow, crossed the border into El Paso, Texas, with Cuauhtemoc and his five siblings, documents show.
Interviews, archival research and government records requests from Newsline help illuminate the multigenerational saga of Luz Chavez, her children and their many descendants, dispersed across the country today in California, Colorado, Georgia, Texas and elsewhere. It’s a story that begins tragically, with the October 1929 death of Evans’ great-grandfather, José Vicente Chavez, in the Mexican border town of Guadalupe, and continues with the hardships of the Great Depression; military service and sacrifice in World War II and Vietnam; and eventually the election, nearly a century later, of one great-grandson to Congress.
The story is also far more complicated than the version that Evans has told on the campaign trail. Luz, Cuauhtemoc and the other Chavez siblings belonged to a generation of immigrants who faced obstacles and prejudices closely resembling the ones faced by immigrants today. The “strong immigration policies” that Evans supports would have led to his grandfather’s deportation a century ago, and many of Evans’ statements in support of those policies distinctly echo the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the 1930s stigmatizing young Mexican Americans like Cuauhtemoc as gangsters, freeloaders and drug peddlers.

As first reported by Newsline last week, Immigration and Naturalization Services documents show that Evans’ grandfather entered the country illegally in 1929, and lived without lawful status for at least the following 12 years; was arrested for violating immigration laws and subjected to deportation proceedings in 1941; and had previously been arrested for attempted burglary. The documents contradict Evans’ previous claims that his grandfather immigrated “legally” or the “legal way,” and other misrepresentations he has made about key dates and details in Cuauhtemoc’s biography.
Evans has refused to answer questions about those documents from Newsline and other news outlets. In comments to CPR News last week, he said he had spoken of his grandfather immigrating “the ‘right way’ … in reference to the fact that (he) joined the military and served his country.”
His office again ignored interview requests for this story, and declined to answer additional questions about why Evans supports policies that treat immigrants today differently than the way his grandfather’s family was treated. His spokesperson, Delanie Bomar, provided a short statement describing Evans as “laser-focused on cracking down on the cartels, eliminating the flow of fentanyl into our communities, and putting public safety first.”
In a previous statement to Newsline, Bomar contrasted “the right way” to immigrate with “the ‘wrong way’ like we saw during the Biden admin with lawlessness at the border, peddling drugs or joining illegal gangs like (Tren de Aragua), folks cutting in line, and being entitled to resources above and beyond what hardworking immigrants who are trying to do it ‘the right way’ are entitled to.”

But the documented history of the Chavez family’s immigration saga — beginning with their unlawful border crossing in 1929 and ending with the naturalization of all of Luz’s surviving children by 1950 — offers little support for any such distinctions.
“Looking at immigration (in terms of) who did it ‘the right way’ versus ‘the wrong way,’ and taking this black-and-white approach, I think is extremely harmful,” said Keilly Leon, the north regional organizer for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient.
“I come from a generation where we’re proud about our background, and we’ve learned to be empowered in our story, and (are) discussing immigration as it is, not trying to hide it under the rug,” Leon said. “I was brought up with that knowledge — always centering the struggles, and understanding, since I was a little kid, the realities and the harshness of this broken system we have.”
Depression-era immigration politics
After falling to nearly zero during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization reached record highs in 2023. The vast majority were refugees fleeing political and economic instability in South and Central America, and many were allowed by former President Joe Biden’s administration to remain in the country while awaiting the outcome of immigration court proceedings, or through a variety of humanitarian parole programs. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that at least 5.7 million people who illegally crossed the border were granted these temporary authorizations — a “significant” number, but far below the figure of 20 million or more routinely claimed by President Donald Trump and other top Republicans.
A similarly sharp rise in immigration preceded Luz Chavez’s arrival with her children in El Paso, where they settled on the city’s south side in a neighborhood known as El Segundo Barrio. A yearly average of about 50,000 Mexican immigrants were granted legal entry to the U.S. in the 1920s, but twice as many others likely entered unlawfully, according to government estimates compiled by historian Lawrence A. Cardoso. This wave of immigration — though largely supported by employers in the Southwest who relied on Mexican workers, known as braceros, as a source of low-wage labor — stoked the fires of nativist backlash across the country.
Supporters of harsh immigration restrictions successfully pressed for measures including the creation of the U.S. Border Patrol and passage of the so-called Undesirable Aliens Act, which expanded federal deportation powers and, for the first time, made crossing the border without authorization a misdemeanor criminal offense. Anti-immigrant rhetoric used today by Trump and his allies bears a striking resemblance to statements made by the bill’s supporters at the time.
“Hordes of undesirable immigrants from Mexico are coming into the United States,” Rep. Charles Edwards of Georgia said in support of the act during a House floor debate in 1929. “As a rule they are not the better or higher-type Mexicans, but generally of the less desirable type … Something must be done to stop this.”

The Undesirable Aliens Act went into effect on July 1, 1929, about five months before records show the Chavez family arrived in El Paso. Together with the new law, pressure from the anti-immigrant lobby forced the federal government to sharply curtail the lawful entry permits granted to Mexican citizens by the Department of State.
The existence of large numbers of immigrants residing in the country unlawfully — known as “deportable aliens” under U.S. law — was well understood at the time, and policymakers and political commentators publicly wrestled with the question of how, as the El Paso Herald-Post put it in 1935, “to humanize treatment of law-abiding aliens, who are technically deportable but whose presence here is not socially harmful.” But immigration restrictionists, still a powerful force in American politics, defeated multiple attempts by President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration to establish pathways for immigrants to legalize their residency.
As the Great Depression set in during the 1930s, some Mexican Americans were rounded up and returned to Mexico in deportation raids, while many others — as many as half of them U.S. citizens, according to one estimate — were pushed out through a coercive campaign that became known as the “repatriation” movement.
“As a result of the crash, there is a kind of binational effort (from) both the U.S. and Mexico, to get folks to go to Mexico,” said Romeo Guzmán, an assistant professor of history at Claremont Graduate University. “There’s a lot of fear tactics and fear campaigns. … There is a whole series of ways in which folks are being encouraged to go back, and that includes folks that are U.S. citizens.”
Depression-era benefits programs became a particularly bitter flashpoint in immigration politics — especially in El Paso, where local officials estimated that noncitizens made up nearly 40% of people on relief rolls. In a 1933 editorial headlined “Feed Our Own People,” the El Paso Times attacked the local relief board’s practice of not discriminating between citizens and noncitizens in handing out free groceries.
“Let this go on, and soon — very soon — there will be a strange filling up of south side tenements, and at the same time a horde of hungry peons will be besieging relief headquarters and carrying away armloads of groceries,” the Times wrote. “We shall be feeding part of Chihuahua and Sonora if there is not some check on aliens. … And there will be that much less for American citizens.”

El Paso’s Catholic charities were among those who rejected such sentiments, and fought deportations of noncitizens whom officials accused of having become a “public charge.” One member of the city’s relief board argued that Mexican immigrants who had been “brought over here and bled to death on low wages” were no less deserving of help. In California, Gov. Culbert Olson, who vetoed a measure to throw noncitizens off the relief rolls, similarly argued that immigrants had “worked for low wages to help create (the state’s) wealth and are entitled to share in it.”
Trump has made false claims about immigrants receiving public benefits at least 270 times, according to an analysis by The Marshall Project. Evans has adopted similar rhetoric to justify the deep cuts to social programs pursued by Trump and congressional Republicans in 2025, including by defending his vote this month in favor of more than $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts on the basis of misleading claims that the program is burdened by the obligation to provide “free handouts to illegal immigrants.”
Immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully are not eligible for Medicaid or most other federal benefit programs, despite paying a total of $100 billion in federal, state and local taxes annually — including $33 billion in payroll taxes that fund Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
Like several other states, Colorado has established a state-funded program to provide health coverage to about 15,000 undocumented children and pregnant people, at a cost of about $50 million a year — a small fraction of the annual loss of more than $1 billion the state faces under the GOP’s Medicaid cuts.
‘We were always hungry’
For the Chavez family, life in El Segundo Barrio during the Great Depression was hardly the realization of the American dream. Lalo Delgado, a Chicano poet who grew up in the neighborhood in the 1930s, called it a “square mile of poverty and misery.”
In a 1993 letter to the editor of the El Paso Times, Cuauhtemoc Chavez — by then 68 years old and retired in New Mexico — praised another writer’s vivid reminiscences of “the lifestyle some of us grew up with in El Segundo Barrio.” They had belonged, he wrote, to a small fellowship of south-siders “who lived it and, thank God, outlived it.”
Work was hard to come by, and sanitary conditions were poor. The 1930 census shows the Chavez family shared an address at a small two-story tenement building with 15 other households. Luz — and from a young age Cuauhtemoc and his brothers and sisters, too — scrounged for work as maids and delivery boys.
“We raided the Japanese farmers’ fields (east of Tornillo Street) for melons, corn, etc., because we were hungry,” Cuauhtemoc recalled in 1993. “We were always hungry.”
El Segundo Barrio “functioned as the city’s vice district,” wrote historian Benjamin Marquez, and reform-minded journalists and judges accused police and municipal officials of taking bribes to allow its gambling and prostitution rings to operate. During Prohibition, the neighborhood was a well-known haven for smugglers, and after its repeal in 1933, local newspapers filled up with lurid stories of the “marihuana” trafficked by young Mexican Americans on the south side: “Nine more boys nabbed in drive on dope,” read an El Paso Herald-Post headline in March 1941. “Police blame marihuana for (El Paso) ‘gangs,’” the El Paso Times reported later that year.
Like Trump and other Republicans, Evans has consistently linked the fentanyl crisis and other drug issues to unauthorized immigration, despite the fact that the “vast majority” of fentanyl entering the U.S. is smuggled through ports of entry by U.S. citizens or other people lawfully crossing the border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
  Headlines from the El Paso Times and the El Paso Herald-Post from the late 1930s and early 1940s focused on waves of petty crime and the influence of “marihuana” and other drugs, with young Mexican Americans often singled out for blame. (Images via Newspapers.com, illustration by Colorado Newsline)
Surviving documents shed little light on the circumstances of Cuauhtemoc’s arrest as a teenager for attempted burglary, beyond the fact that he was subsequently released.
If he had committed no crime, he would have been far from the only one of his peers to have been wrongfully accused of such an offense; when waves of petty crime hit El Paso in the Depression years, suspicion often fell on young Mexican Americans, who were liable to be rounded up in heavy-handed dragnets. After one jewelry store heist in 1940, the Herald-Post reported, 17 boys were arrested by police for “thorough questioning,” and all but four were released days later.
Merely being charged with a property crime is enough to be held in detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement under a new law enacted by Republicans and a handful of Democrats in Congress this year. With Evans’ support, the Laken Riley Act was passed despite widespread concern that its detention requirements violated due process principles.
When asked by CPR News about his grandfather’s attempted burglary arrest, Evans said it was “something that happened 80 years ago” and that authorities had “looked at the totality of the circumstances” in granting him citizenship.
“Every single case is different in its own unique individual and the facts of that case,” Evans said.
Such a case-by-case approach would be a shift from Evans’ long history of support for “immediate deportation for criminals.” In recent months, as the share of people in ICE detention without criminal convictions has risen sharply, he has repeatedly defended the detention of anyone “arrested and charged with a crime.”
Fewer than half of ICE arrestees under Trump are convicted criminals

“We have to aggressively target those individuals who are illegally in our communities, committing crimes, and those are the folks that we have to deport,” he said in an October 2024 debate. “I’ve never wavered from that.”
On social media, Evans frequently highlights crimes allegedly committed by immigrants in the country unlawfully while attacking Colorado’s “sanctuary” policies, a habit that hasn’t been interrupted by the revelation that his grandfather was accused of a crime as a teenager. ICE announced on July 23 that it had arrested 243 immigrants lacking permanent legal status in the Denver area during a nine-day enforcement operation. Though the agency released the names of only four detainees, and only claimed that about 50 of the 243 had been charged with or convicted of a crime, Evans praised the operation’s removal of “240+ dangerous illegal immigrants” from the streets.
“Sheltering these criminals makes our entire state unsafe and Colorado Democrats are to blame,” he wrote.
In March, Evans falsely claimed that crime rates rose following an influx of migrants to Denver in 2023. Studies have consistently shown that U.S. immigrants broadly, and undocumented immigrants specifically, commit crimes at substantially lower rates than the U.S.-born population.
Service and citizenship
On July 25, 1941, Cuauhtemoc and at least two of his sisters were arrested by federal agents for violating immigration laws, INS documents show. All three were accused of “illegal entry” and “made the subject of deportation proceedings” in El Paso. The outcome of those proceedings is not known. Deportation records from El Paso and most other ports of entry “were destroyed years ago,” according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Cuauhtemoc next appears in the historical record on Dec. 18, 1942, two months after his 18th birthday, when he was cited in El Paso traffic court for operating a commercial vehicle without a license, receiving a $10 fine. On the same date, he filled out a registration card with the county draft board. He was drafted into the U.S. Army three months later, becoming one of more than 15,000 Mexican American noncitizens to serve in the armed forces during World War II before his honorable discharge in October 1945.










My dad would have had zero, and I mean zero, tolerance for someone like (Trump).


– Jennifer Chavez, Cuauhtemoc's daughter


Cuauhtemoc’s naturalization petition, submitted in January 1946, indicates that he received citizenship under a 1944 law that eliminated proof of “lawful entry” as a requirement for naturalization, if the petitioner had “serve(d) honorably in (the armed) forces beyond the continental limits of the United States.” On his petition form, references to “lawful entry” are blacked out, and next to fields for listing his dates of service, the phrase “And during such service I served honorably beyond the Continental U.S., to wit: Europe” was added. He was granted citizenship on April 1, 1946.
All five of Cuauhtemoc’s siblings eventually attained legal status, according to INS records. One, a sister named Greda, died at age 23 in 1946, but court records show that each of the other four became naturalized citizens through various means by 1950. A half-brother, Augustin, was born a U.S. citizen in El Paso in 1932.
In the postwar years, Cuauhtemoc — who went by “Cuate” or “C.E.” — went on to serve as president of a union representing civil service workers at El Paso’s Fort Bliss. After Greda’s death, he helped raise her son, Alfredo Reyes, who served in the Marines and was killed in action in Vietnam in 1967.
Though Cuauhtemoc died in 2014, his union service and the death of his nephew top the list of reasons why Jennifer Chavez, Cuauhtemoc’s daughter and Evans’ aunt, is certain that he would have strongly opposed Trump’s presidential candidacy two years later.
“I can’t even begin to imagine what my dad would have thought of Trump — being that, you know, he was a coward and a deserter,” Jennifer said in an interview, referring to Trump’s five draft deferments during the Vietnam War. “My dad would have had zero, and I mean zero, tolerance for someone like that.”
“When Gabe started to misrepresent our father in his campaign,” she added, “by portraying my dad as being in support of everything that Gabe is in support of — (that) would have pissed my dad off.”

(Powered by People)Beto O’Rourke, a former presidential candidate and U.S. congressman, is back on a national tour and he’s stopping in Indiana this weekend. 
O’Rourke will host a free town hall meeting at 3 p.m. Sunday, Aug.3, at VisionLoft Stutz in downtown Indianapolis to hear directly from Hoosiers. The event is open to the public and attendees can RSVP at PoweredxPeople.org. 
During the town hall, the former U.S. Representative from Texas, plans to take questions from audience members on state and federal issues, as well as discussing the future of American democracy with Hoosiers, according to a press release. 
The veteran campaigner nearly unseated Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate race in 2018. He also ran for president in 2020 but after nearly eight months of campaigning, he stepped out of the race and endorsed President Joe Biden. Most recently, he ran for governor of Texas in 2022 but lost to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Although he didn’t seal any recent victories, he’s remained active in national politics through voter engagement and his grass-root organization. 
O’Rourke launched his voter mobilization group, Powered by People, in 2019. Since the group’s founding, he has been on the road to hear directly from individuals and to register voters. The group has run one of the largest progressive voter mobilization efforts in Texas history and has registered thousands of Texans to vote, according to the release. 
He has held more than a dozen town halls across Texas, including more than 10 public meetings in congressional districts served by Republicans. He has also led more than 20 events across the country, organizing college students to register to vote and visiting states that have been “taken for granted.”
The Indianapolis stop is part of O’Rourke’s ongoing tour. Before arriving in Indiana, he will hold town halls in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and Wisconsin. During previous meetings he has sparked speculation about potential U.S. Senate run in the 2026 election and called on Democrats to launch gerrymandering campaigns. 
This town hall meeting isn’t his first visit to Indiana – he previously held a town hall during his presidential campaign at J’s Breakfast Club in Gary.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TownHall-Beto.avif,,,2025-07-31 13:57:37.218996

Bernie Sanders, shown speaking in Tempe, Arizona, on March 20, 2025 at a “Fight Oligarchy” rally, will speak at three events in West Virginia Aug. 8 and 9. (Jerod MacDonald-Evoy | Arizona Mirror)U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, a one-time candidate for president, will bring his “Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here” speaking event tour to three West Virginia locations next weekend. 
Sanders will speak in Wheeling Friday, Aug. 8 and in Mingo County and Charleston on Saturday, Aug. 9. 
Sanders’ website describes the tour as “real discussions across America on how we move forward to take on the Oligarchs and corporate interests who have so much power and influence in this country.
The tour will target “deep red” districts held by Republicans, including West Virginia and North Carolina, according to a news release.
“Red state, blue state — the people of this country are opposed to an economy that works for the 1% and not for working class Americans.” Sanders said in a news release. “I’ll be heading to West Virginia and North Carolina to discuss the need for decent paying jobs, health care for all, and the end of a corrupt campaign finance system in which billionaires buy politicians. Together, we can defeat the oligarchs who have taken hold of our country.”
Sanders ran for president as a Democrat in 2016, losing in the primary to Hillary Clinton. 
He won the Democratic primary that year in every county in West Virginia, the West Virginia Democratic Party noted in a news release Thursday. The party said they welcome Sanders to the state, calling the visit a reminder of what public service should look like. 
“While Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, Sen. Jim Justice, Congressman Riley Moore, and Congresswoman Carol Miller continue to avoid public town halls and shield themselves from accountability, Senator Sanders is once again doing what they refuse to do: meeting directly with the people of West Virginia,” they said in the statement. “We are thankful for his continued advocacy on many issues, especially on behalf of health care access, a strong and solvent Social Security system, quality public education and most importantly, reducing the influence of money in politics. 
“While perspectives may vary on some of Senator Sanders’ positions, his commitment to economic fairness and opportunity resonates deeply with West Virginians,” they wrote.

Clothing and shoes under $100 are exempt from taxes during the annual three-day event. 
The state reimburses cities and counties for lost revenue. 
Last session, Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond, introduced a bill that would add sportswear and school items like art supplies, instructional materials and computer items to the list.
But Senate Bill 231 did not advance.
The overall impact on state revenue if more items were added to the tax-exempt list was unknown, but would cost at least $12.6 million, according to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.
According to the Tax Foundation, 19 states have held or will hold sales tax holidays in 2025.
Oklahoma’s back-to-school sales tax holiday was created in 2007.

The campaign targets two initiatives that aim to make proof of citizenship and other checks a requirement before registering to vote or casting a ballot. Ads for the effort are running statewide on digital platforms, but the campaign plans to move to in-person organizing and more direct advertising if needed.
One of the ballot initiative efforts is being led by state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) through the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights, while the other committee, Americans for Citizen Voting, is being backed by some segments of the Michigan Republican Party, including state Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake), who is also serving as the party’s chair.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Both initiatives have received approval from the Michigan Board of State Canvassers, and are eyeing the 2026 ballot.
Americans for Citizen Voting committee was the first to launch its signature drive on Wednesday in Oakland County. The Posthumus-led initiative plans to launch soon and once funding is in order, Gongwer News Service reported.
Either way, Common Cause is asking Michiganders to decline to sign both petitions when they encounter signature gatherers through the rest of summer and into the fall.

If approved, the measures could mean some eligible U.S. citizens could also lose their right to vote in Michigan, Common Cause said in a news release.
“The vast majority of Michiganders believe our elections are fair, but an extreme minority wants to take away our right to vote and is misleading us on their targets. It’s a trap. Don’t fall for it,” Quentin Turner, executive director of Common Cause Michigan, said in a statement. “Both of these poorly named ballot initiatives would take away U.S. citizen’s right to vote unless they slogged through tons of costly red tape. This is not abstract; we know from our members directly that some would lose their right to vote as U.S. citizens.”
Turner said the group will aim to educate as many Michiganders as needed that their friends and neighbors would be affected if this makes the ballot.

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)New Mexico’s Public Education Department will hold a series of regional community meetings across the state next month to help inform the remedial action plan ordered to improve educational equity for at-risk New Mexico students.
The education department’s August meetings are part of the process of meeting First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson’s orders in the long-running Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit, which identified in 2018 that the state had failed to provide equitable learning opportunities for Native American and low income students, English Language Learners and children from low-income families.
Wilson found in April that the state had failed to address the concerns of the court and ordered the Public Education Department to assemble a remedial action plan. He gave the state until Oct. 1 to complete a draft of the plan and until Nov. 3 to file the final plan with the court. 
The PED recently met the first deadline – identifying an outside expert to assist with the plan’s development – by July 1. The department partnered with the Northern New Mexico-based Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation.
According to a news release from the nonprofit, LANL Foundation President and CEO Gwen Perea Warniment said the foundation is devoted to “completing a transparent, trustworthy, and inclusive Action Plan that reflects the priorities of communities across the state.” She added that they intend to work with “students, families, tribal governments, educators, and advocates to ensure the Action Plan is not only comprehensive but also grounded in lived experience.”
Twelve community meetings are scheduled from Farmington to Carlsbad throughout August. Members of the public are invited to attend and provide their feedback, which will help inform the remedial plan. 



Meeting locations include:

Aug. 5 – Farmington, Española, Las Cruces
Aug. 6 – Raton
Aug. 7 – Santa Fe, Mescalero, Clovis
Aug. 14 – Silver City, Zuni, Carlsbad
Aug. 20 – Albuquerque
Aug. 26 – Virtual Community Meeting

More details are available online.



According to the PED, the plan will address five areas including access to high-quality instruction; high-quality and linguistically-informed teachers; support services; effective funding; and accountability systems.
“The New Mexico Public Education Department is making steady progress toward developing the Martinez/Yazzie Action Plan,” PED spokesperson Janelle Taylor Garcia told Source NM in a written statement.
Transform Education NM Executive Director Loretta Trujillo told Source that her organization is “satisfied” with the progress made so far by the PED and LANL Foundation.
“They invited organizations who have demonstrated relationships to communities to be involved as facilitators of these different stakeholder meetings around the state. And so we have been invited to the table, so to speak,” Trujillo said. “We’ve always said, in our work as a coalition, that if community voices were at the center, that we could move the needle.”
Trujillo said she was particularly delighted that students themselves are invited to the meetings and will have the chance to share feedback on their own education. She said her organization has gathered groups of young New Mexicans in three parts of the state over the past year and a half and gathered feedback as well.
“What has manifested over six years or seven years now, is a lot of year-to-year initiatives that are not connected by a shared vision that everybody has in common,” Trujillo said. “This call for a comprehensive plan is, with that understanding in mind, in order to make funding decisions in any particular legislative session, we need our legislative body to understand that this depth of vision is all in one place. They’ve contributed to it, stakeholders have contributed to it, youth have contributed to it and we’re not just making one-off decisions.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/preschoolchildren-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 13:57:37.218996

(Matthew White/Getty Images)Liquefied natural gas vessels are fueled by their cargo—they’re built specifically to make use of the gas boiling off from their tanks.
But Cheniere Energy, the largest U.S. exporter of LNG, is seeking “alternative fuel” tax credits for that. The claim has baffled shipping experts because what Cheniere Energy is doing isn’t, in any real sense, an alternative. It would also provide little climate benefit over fueling the vessels with diesel and seeks to use the credit in a way that tax specialists say was never intended.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Yet if approved by the Internal Revenue Service, the claimed tax credits could yield a payout for the company exceeding $140 million, an Inside Climate News analysis found.
In its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February, Cheniere disclosed that it is “actively pursuing” alternative fuel tax credits for its use of LNG in its shipping vessels from 2018 to 2024, the year the tax credit expired. The IRS is reviewing those claims, the filing said.
The alternative fuel excise tax credit was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2005. It was intended to incentivize the use of fuels other than gasoline and diesel—including biofuels, LNG and liquid fuels derived from coal—for use in motor vehicles, and it set no requirements for the relative cleanliness of these fuels.
Cheniere noted in its financial report that LNG is a cleaner-burning fuel than diesel or heavy-fuel oils and that the use of LNG was part of an ongoing effort to mitigate emissions from the company’s shipping operations. However, critics point out that fueling LNG tankers with diesel would be absurd, given that the gas continually boiling off from the refrigerated liquid cargo would have to be burned off anyway, or re-liquefied, if it wasn’t used for propulsion.
“It makes no sense not to use the fuel that you already have because of boil-off,” said Kirsten Sinclair Rosselot, an environmental performance analyst who runs the consultancy Process Profiles and was the lead author of a 2023 study that assessed fuel use and emissions from LNG vessels. “It’s not an alternative fuel.”
Cheniere declined repeated requests for comment from Inside Climate News. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association representing the U.S. oil and gas industry, also declined to comment.

Cheniere’s eligibility for the tax credit may hinge on how the IRS interprets one word: motorboats. The statute states that tax credits can be claimed for the use of LNG and other alternative fuels “in a motor vehicle or motorboat.”
“It’s a very aggressive tax position,” William Henck, a former IRS tax attorney and agency whistleblower, said of Cheniere’s alternative fuel tax credit claim. “It just seems like they’re pushing the envelope here.”
The tax law doesn’t define what constitutes a motorboat. However, federal shipping regulations state it is a vessel no more than 65 feet long. LNG tankers typically extend nearly 1,000 feet.
“They’re talking about a tanker,” Henck said. “Does that sound like a motorboat to you?”
If the IRS approves Cheniere’s claim, the company would be eligible for a 50-cent tax credit for each diesel gallon equivalent of fuel used. Cheniere declined to reveal the size of the tax credit it is claiming. However, according to calculations by Inside Climate News, it could exceed $140 million. 










It just seems like they’re pushing the envelope here.


– William Henck, former IRS tax attorney


From Jan. 1, 2018, to Dec. 31, 2024, Cheniere used company-chartered vessels to export LNG on more than 750 departures from its terminals in Sabine Pass, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas, according to shipping data from Kpler, a global trade analytics firm. The data was analyzed by Data Desk, which conducts investigative research on the oil and gas industry, and Inside Climate News.
Adapting methods used for an earlier Inside Climate News investigation of emissions from LNG tankers, ICN calculated that those export journeys burned about 770,000 metric tons of LNG in the vessels’ main engines and generators. Applying the conversion factor approved for the tax credit, that corresponds to more than 280 million diesel gallons equivalent or a credit of roughly $140 million. These calculations do not include LNG used on the subsequent return journeys by the same vessels, which are fueled from a small quantity of the cargo retained for that purpose. If Cheniere is also claiming credits for these journey legs, the payout could nearly double.
ICN also calculated the total greenhouse gas emissions using LNG fuel, compared to a hypothetical situation in which ships were powered by the 280 million diesel gallons equivalent and simply flared the LNG boiling off from their cargo. Using LNG did reduce total carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions compared to the hypothetical diesel-fueled journeys, but only by about 12.5%. (LNG tankers have relatively high total emissions because of the methane that slips unburned through their engines.)
Companies should only assume the effects of a tax position in their financial projections when there is a 50% or more likelihood that their claims will be sustained after the IRS weighs in, according to guidance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards for companies, and accounting firm PwC.
Cheniere stated in its SEC filing that it hasn’t included the tax credits in its projections. The company added that “we believe we qualify and are entitled to claim such credits” but acknowledged “there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the final determination of our eligibility.”
Anthony Burke, a spokesperson for the IRS, declined to comment, stating that “by law, federal employees cannot disclose tax return information.”
Burke did not respond to follow-up questions about whether the IRS has received requests for guidance on the use of LNG in export vessels related to alternative fuel tax credits or whether the agency has provided such guidance to companies.
Lukas Shankar-Ross, deputy director of the climate and energy justice program at Friends of the Earth, said approval of the tax credit by the IRS would raise red flags.
“If the IRS decides that Cheniere’s globe-spanning charter vessels the length of a city block are equivalent to 65-foot motorboats, then the independence of the IRS is obviously in question,” said Shankar-Ross, who drew Cheniere’s claim to the attention of ICN.
Fuel tax credits have long been a focus of controversy. Henck’s whistleblowing involved a situation in which the IRS began approving alternative fuel tax credits to paper mills for their use of something called black liquor.
That byproduct from pulp manufacturing has been burned as fuel in paper mills for nearly a century. Adding in a small amount of diesel—as little as a few drops—qualified the blend for alternative fuel mixture credits that resulted in the use of more diesel, rather than less, and were ultimately worth $8 billion, according to The Washington Post.
“It was aggressive enough that they got the credit in the first place,” said Henck, who at the time advised teams of IRS agents examining tax returns for larger companies. “But what went way over the line, and the reason why I spoke out, is they didn’t even have to report that stuff as taxable income.”
The IRS approved the paper mills’ tax refund amid lobbying by the paper companies. Shankar-Ross said he worries something similar may be happening now with Cheniere, whose claims may get a sympathetic hearing from the fossil-fuel friendly Trump administration.
Company CEO Jack Fusco attended a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April 2024, when then presidential candidate Donald Trump urged oil and gas executives to donate $1 billion to his campaign, according to reporting by The New York Times. Trump said the money would more than pay for itself in saved taxes and legal expenses, The Times reported.
Two months later, Fusco donated a total of nearly $500,000 to a Trump political action committee, and the Republican National Committee, according to Federal Election Commission data.
“If Cheniere is looking for a return on investment in its very generous contribution to the Trump campaign, this is certainly an excellent opportunity,” Shankar-Ross said.
Shankar-Ross said he worries that if Cheniere receives tax credits for its use of LNG, others will follow. That happened with paper mills, Henck said.
“You can rest assured that if Cheniere gets approved, anyone else in the same situation will file refund claims,” Henck said. “I guarantee you that.”
Cheniere spent just over $1.7 million lobbying Congress and the administration with its in-house team in the first half of 2025, according to federal lobbying reports. Part of that sum was spent on lobbying the Treasury Department, of which the IRS is a part, and the Executive Office of the President on “tax issues impacting businesses and the LNG industry.”
Lobbying on tax credits, Henck has found, can make all the difference.
“I hate to say this, but the actual law or common sense has nothing to do with this,” Henck said.
“If they can get inside access, one-on-one meetings with the decision makers in the IRS national office, they can get this thing through.”

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Bacterial infections from coastal waters and seafood are abnormally high in Louisiana so far this year, with 17 hospitalizations and four deaths so far, according to the Louisiana Department of Health. 
This is a jump up from the average of seven cases and one death over the same period in previous years. Of the 17 people hospitalized, 75% reported their open wounds were directly exposed to seawater. 
State health officials advise against swimming in brackish or salt water with open wounds, including small cuts and scrapes. The department also encourages people to wear gloves when handling shellfish and to use caution when eating raw or undercooked seafood, especially if you have a weakened immune system, are pregnant or have certain medical conditions such as liver or stomach disorders. 
Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria commonly found in warm, coastal waters, grows faster between May and October as waters get warmer and more hospitable to the microbes. The bacteria can cause blood poisoning, wound infection and stomach illness.
 Common symptoms include fever, chills, vomiting, wound discharge and pain, and blistering skin lesions depending on the type of illness. 
About one in five people who get this type of infection die, and many require serious medical treatment, such as the amputation of an infected limb, according to the health department. 
While anyone can contract this kind of bacterial infection, those with preexisting health conditions – such as diabetes and liver disease – or who are otherwise immunocompromised are more prone to getting sick and having higher risk for complications. 
Precautions if you are at a higher risk include washing hands with soap and water after handling raw shellfish, wearing clothes and shoes that can protect you from cuts and scrapes when in brackish or salt water, and using caution around raw seafood.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4366-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 13:57:37.218996

The 10% out-of-state tuition raise at the two institutions follows the University of Florida, Florida State University, and Florida International University in doing the same. 
FIU joins FSU, UF in raising out-of-state tuition; more schools may follow

The difference, however, is that UF created a one-year waiver allowing students who can prove a “significant” financial hardship to not pay the increase. 
“Obviously, this was not a banner year for universities as it relates to recurring funds from the state,” USF trustee chair Will Weatherford said during a virtual special meeting. 
UCF is expected to increase its revenue by $9.5 million next year with the tuition increase, and USF by $9 million. 
Florida universities are required by law to limit the number of out-of-state students enrolled, even with the increasing price that non-Floridians will pay. 
“It’s not cheap to run a public university and we’re heavily subsidizing out-of-state students,” Weatherford, a former Florida House speaker, said, adding that trustees are trying to “find a balance.”
UCF trustees expressed a desire to make clear to students the financial aid options they will have after the tuition increase. 
The Board of Governors approved last month a rule allowing universities to raise out-of-state tuition this academic year and next. 
The maximum increase this year is 10%. Next year, institutions may vote to increase out-of-state tuition by 15%. 
Out-of-state tuition had not increased at a Florida institution since 2012. In-state tuition has not increased since 2013.

This story originally appeared on Georgia Recorder.
A conservative political action committee associated with the family at the heart of the ongoing First Liberty Building & Loan scandal illegally influenced elections to the tune of more than $220,000, according to a complaint filed Wednesday by the Georgia State Ethics Commission.
The ethics complaint alleges that the Georgia Republican Assembly PAC failed to register as an independent committee before making expenditures to affect the outcome of recent elections. The complaint also alleges the PAC failed to file 24 required disclosure reports between Dec. 31, 2021 and June 30.
The complaint also lists three dozen expenditures made around that time frame totaling more than $220,000. The allegedly improper expenses include payments to entities like consultants, printing shops, doorknockers and canvassers.

According to campaign finance records, Frost, members of his family or his businesses made at least $132,000 in contributions to Alabama politicians and political action committees (PACs). Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell, who is running for secretary of state, received $71,000; a PAC he controlled later made a $29,000 loan to Frost’s businesses. Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont, received $21,000 and Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long received $40,000. Sorrell and Harrison have both said they plan to return the donations.
“The ethics complaint filed today represent our initial charges against the Georgia Republican Assembly – PAC,” said ethics commission Executive Director David Emadi in a statement. “Our investigation remains ongoing and additional charges may be coming at a future date, but we intend to aggressively pursue all violations of Georgia law committed by the GRA which illegally influenced elections in 2022 and 2024.”
The PAC’s articles of organization, filed with the Georgia Secretary of State’s office in 2017, list former Cobb GOP chairman Jason Shepherd as registered agent and Brant Frost V as organizer.
In a phone call, Shepherd said he broke ties with the Georgia Republican Assembly in 2021.
Georgia man accused of running $140M Ponzi scheme contributed to 3 Alabama officials

Frost is the son of Brant Frost IV, who was implicated in an alleged Ponzi scheme in which Frost IV allegedly bilked evangelical conservative investors out of millions of dollars to spend on jewelry, a vacation home and other luxury goods. First Liberty and the Frosts also allegedly made more than $1 million in donations to political candidates and causes with scammed money, and the Georgia Republican Assembly PAC was a major recipient.
Politicians had returned more than $130,000 of the donations as of Monday, according to the court-appointed receiver tasked with trying to recoup victims’ money.
In an email, Nathaniel Darnell, president of the Georgia Republican Assembly, emphasized that his organization is a separate legal entity from the GRA PAC.
“As we have mentioned before, the Georgia Republican Assembly PAC was a completely separate legal and financial organization from the regular Georgia Republican Assembly. Only the Frost family had control and oversight of the PAC. About ten years ago, the then-GRA Board had granted Brant Frost V a license to use the name. When the Frosts publicly resigned from the GRA last month, Brant Frost V sent us a message saying that he was planning on shutting it down at the conclusion of June, which he did. We have also messaged him telling him to cease and desist the use of the name in the PAC’s LLC.”
The GRA has come under the spotlight for political infighting, and a number of members, including Frost IV and his son as well as four other Frosts were among the dozens who publicly signed a document last month resigning from the GRA.
Shepherd said it is a common tactic for political organizations to keep their PACs separate from the main body to prevent legal issues that could spring up surrounding political donations, but he suggested the Georgia Republican Assembly has skirted that rule, including by featuring the PAC on the main GRA website and discussing PAC business during regular GRA meetings.
“It’s the same thing with the National Rifle Association, they have a separate PAC that if there’s ever an issue like what the GRA PAC is facing right now, if they’ve potentially missed filings or filed things wrong, where they could potentially be fined, that the main organization is not bearing the brunt of this,” he said. “But it was clear from the get-go that the GRA PAC was affiliated, it was sanctioned, it was approved, it was promoted by the Georgia Republican Assembly itself as the political financing arm of the organization.”

(File Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)A new legislative audit is casting doubts on hundreds of millions of dollars in savings claimed earlier this year by Gov. Wes Moore.
In June, the Democratic chief executive and his staff announced budget cuts of $400 million — exceeding a goal of $50 million promised by Moore. On Thursday, the office of Legislative Audits released a report casting doubt on those claims and a lack of transparency in how the Department of General Services presented those deals to a state panel led by Moore.
“Our audit disclosed that DGS could not support that $410.9 million in leases to relocate state agencies to downtown Baltimore were in the State’s best interest,” Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen wrote in the report.
Tanen added that the department, which handles state leasing, “did not perform an analysis of the cost-benefits of purchasing property instead of awarding leases to private entities and the lease awards were not always presented to the Board of Public Works in a transparent manner.”
The audit of the Department of General Services, released Thursday, also includes criticism of an unusual 20-year lease agreement that bakes in $10 million in renovations. The deal for office space for the Maryland Department of the Environment severely limits the state’s ability to cancel the lease.
Moore vowed to find at least $50 million in savings as part of a fiscal 2026 spending plan he proposed earlier this year. The effort was a small part of attacking what was then a projected $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.

He convened a panel, led by Chief Performance Officer Asma Mirza, and charged it with finding efficiencies in procurement, real estate, and fleet management.
Mirza told reporters in June that the effort represented a “data-driven approach to modernizing state government operations.”
In June, they declared they had exceeded the target by identifying more than $400 million in savings. Of that, more than 80% of the announced savings is projected to come from moving departments from state-owned buildings into leased commercial space in downtown Baltimore. The projected savings would not be immediate but over a 20-to-25-year period.
The plan appeared to capture some savings already expected from a decision to move thousands of state employees out of the decaying State Center property in Baltimore.
At one point, the plan was to partner with the private sector to redevelop the 25-acre state office complex, which sits on a Metro stop and is adjacent to the light rail.
The plan, approved in 2009, fell apart after officials balked at the excessive rents and parking rates that would be charged to state agencies moving back into the new facility. Later, then-Gov. Larry Hogan (R) filed a lawsuit to terminate the $1.5 billion project. The developer countersued. The Board of Public Works, led by Moore, voted unanimously in November to settle with developer State Center LLC for $58.5 million.
At the time of the settlement, there were fewer than 5,000 employees from seven state agencies at the center. The state plans to move all remaining employees to other locations by the end of 2026.
The future of the State Center property is undetermined. Options include turning over the midtown property to the city or selling to a developer.
In a written response to the auditor’s findings, the department called the conclusions on State Center “not factually accurate.”
“DGS conducted cost-benefit analyses for the State Center campus in order to determine the most cost beneficial option for the state agencies located on this site,” the agency wrote in its response.
The department added that two cost-benefit analyses were conducted on the State Center move and determined the move to leased space was in the best interest of the state.
“While DGS could not explore every conceivable option for relocating State Center, DGS was deliberate in considering relevant, realistic, and viable options,” the department wrote in its response to the auditor.
Purchasing new properties to relocate state agencies was “determined to not be a viable option.” The department cited concerns about “extensive capital funding” for renovations and “extensive maintenance costs.”
Auditors, in a footnote, wrote that the department could not provide documentation including formal analysis that showed efforts to maximize the state’s purchasing power. Auditors added that “the response does not contradict the facts presented in the finding.”
Negotiating “aggressive lease rates”
One official, in a June briefing with reporters, said the state would take advantage of the large amount of available commercial office space and negotiate “very aggressive lease rates.”
The recent audit cast doubt on some of those claims.
In one case, auditors noted that the state was spending nearly $278 million over 15 years for office space for the Maryland Department of Health. The space is leased in a building that the current landlord purchased for $16 million in 20216, the report notes.
“Given the significant amount of space being leased by certain of these agencies, we question whether the decision to lease was the most cost-beneficial alternative,” auditors wrote.
Auditors also noted that the Department of General Services could not document how much consideration was given to consolidating leases into a single location. Auditors could find only one example where two departments relocated under a single lease.
Auditors wrote that while the department said it did consider multiple agencies in a single lease, it “did not formally analyze whether agencies should be co-located to maximize the State’s purchasing power to achieve operational efficiencies.”
Additionally, auditors noted that the department failed to determine fair market rates for the leases “resulting in a lack of assurance that the leases were at or below market rates.”
Again, officials at the department disagreed with the findings.
In a response to auditors, the department said it “contracts with independent commercial real estate brokers to accurately determine the fair market rates for all leases in order to ensure that leases are procured at rates that are either at, or below, market rates for the area.”
Hidden costs
Another concern for auditors was the lack of transparency in how lease deals were presented to the Board of Public Works. The three-member panel led by the governor reviews and approves billions in state contracts annually.
A review of board agendas, minutes and other documents raised concerns that the total costs of lease awards was not always disclosed.
Auditors looked at eight agreements. They found that the department reported only the first year of the cost of the lease to the board but not the full cost over agreements that lasted 10-15 years. Excluded from those costs were annual rent escalations.
In one case, a lease for the Department of Human Services was presented as a $3.7 million deal. Not disclosed was that the lease costs grow to $5.8 million by the tenth year and cost nearly $50 million over the life of the deal.
Also excluded were other costs such as parking. The eight leases reviewed included nearly $5 million in annual parking costs that were not reflected in presentations to the board.
Auditors added that the department “did not properly evaluate lease proposals, raising questions as to whether the lease awards were the most advantageous to the state.”
In its response, the department said its presentation of leases was “legally sufficient”
However, the department signaled that it would change how it presents leases in the future.
“DGS acknowledges that additional clarification can be obtained by reporting the total rent value for the rental term, which can meet best practices,” the agency wrote in its response. “Accordingly, DGS will begin including a line item for the total rent value for the term of the lease and a line item for parking costs when parking is a component of the lease, on all lease transaction items beginning with the July 2, 2025, BPW agenda.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_statecenter6_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 12:38:00.205060

“In 2021 and 2022, I was hospitalized on multiple occasions due to a condition called Rhabdomyolysis,” Weil said in a written statement. “In the last few weeks traveling across the state, I noticed an increase in symptoms associated with my hospitalizations. After discussion with my family, I have decided to focus on my health first and foremost.”
Rhabdomyolysis is a rare condition in which the muscles break down following an injury or excessive exercise without rest, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It can be life threatening.
“Florida deserves a US Senator who can fight for them 100% of the time,” Weil said. “I do not wish to hold that seat if I cannot give them that 100% that they deserve. My hope is by bowing out this early in the cycle, another staunch progressive enter the race and be successful [sic]. I trust that both my run for the special election and for Senate has demonstrated to everyday working Americans that they can make a difference by running for office in their communities.”
Weil, 40, announced his candidacy for the Senate seat last month. An Orlando educator, he made national news for raising around $15 million in a special congressional election against Republican Randy Fine in Florida’s Sixth District in April. Alhough he lost to Fine by 14 points, the result surprised political observers, who noted that Republican Mike Waltz had won the same congressional seat last November by 33 points.
Weil had boasted that not only would he run a competitive race and raise tens of millions of dollars needed to compete against Moody next year, but also that he intended to raise $10 million for voter registration efforts across the state, with a particular interest in Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties.
“We are committing to invest $1 million in the field, for every congressional district in this state, to make sure that we carry the message to voters where they are, in every district in every county, in ways that our party has been unable to cycle after cycle,” he said in Clearwater in May.
Weil’s withdrawal focuses attention on former Brevard County School Board member Jennifer Jenkins, who told the Phoenix last week that she was “seriously considering” entering the race.
“Josh made the choice that felt right for him,” Jenkins told the Phoenix Thursday in a text message. “It doesn’t change the conversations I’ve been having or the work I’ve been doing. I’ve been seriously weighing this because I believe Floridians deserve a Senator who actually shows up and I won’t stop fighting for what this state could be. It definitely makes the path smoother.”
Another potential candidate is retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, whose testimony before Congress helped lead to President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial. He’s now a resident of Broward County and has told reporters recently that he is considering entering the contest.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters). Auditors panned a $167.1 million lease deal for the Maryland Department of the Environment in a report released Thursday afternoon, arguing the state overpaid to secure a $10 million office renovation budget from its landlord.
The Department of the Environment lease was one of several that auditors determined could not be justified by the Maryland Department of General Services — which handles state leasing — including $410.9 million worth of leases to relocate state agencies to offices in downtown Baltimore. The Moore administration had upheld the Baltimore deals as a cost savings.
The audit, previously reported by Maryland Matters, pointed to several “questionable” aspects of the Department of the Environment’s lease, including its 20-year term, a 3.45% annual cost escalation and the omission of a key termination right for the state.
Auditors wrote that the $10 million renovation may have skirted state budget law, after General Services revealed that it pursued the strategy in part because the environmental agency didn’t have the budget for renovations to its offices.
Auditors wrote that, because of an elevated rental cost, the state would be paying an extra $12.6 million, essentially funding the largely cosmetic renovations to privately held Montgomery Park, a converted warehouse building in West Baltimore along Interstate 95.
They argued the agreement was out of the ordinary in “numerous aspects,” and cast doubt on whether it was in the best interest of the state’s finances. Meanwhile, state government is in the midst of a historic budget pinch, with an effort to slash payrolls through a $20,000 buyout offer to employees, and to axe real estate costs wherever possible.
The Department of General Services disputed many of the audit’s findings, and argued that the lease actually saved the state money, because the escalation rate decreased compared to the 4% escalator in the previous lease at Montgomery Park, where the environmental agency has been since 2002.
  An early conceptual rendering shows a mock-up of new employee office space at the Maryland Department of the Environment. DGS officials said the renderings are “not the most current,” adding that updated renderings are being prepared by the landlord’s architect. (Screenshot of renderings provided through a public records request)
The agency fiercely defended its strategy of rolling the renovation budget into the lease, arguing that the practice “allows the state to strategically leverage its buying power by having landlords design and construct leased space to the State’s exact specifications.”
In its response, the agency stated that the Department of the Environment was “unable to consider directly paying $10 million to reimburse the landlord for renovation costs due to budget constraints.” So the agencies sought it from the landlord, “due to the facility having no prior major renovations for cubicles.”
Auditors said that this line of defense — that the agency obtained the renovations through the lease because it didn’t have sufficient capital funds — “raises new concerns that the structure of this lease may have circumvented State budget law.”
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore’s administration has embraced leases, arguing that the state shouldn’t be saddled with large office buildings with potentially costly repair needs, with the example of the deteriorating State Center office complex in Baltimore looming large.
When it came to the Department of the Environment lease, auditors from the Department of Legislative Services noted that $7.9 million of the $10 million renovation budget “primarily consisted of cubicle enhancements.” And because the cubicle changes were not procured through a competitive bid, auditors could not determine whether the price was fair.
“DGS could not document that it assessed whether this work was necessary and that the costs were reasonable, or that it considered separately procuring the Services,” reads the audit.
The Department of General Services also could not show that it ever considered using furniture from the Maryland Correctional Enterprises, which sells a variety of products through a program that trains state inmates. State regulations “generally require agencies to procure goods and services from MCE when available,” the audit reads.
In its response, the department argued that the building’s owner Himmelrich Associates offered a plan to refurbish and renovate the existing cubicles” for the roughly 900-person agency “at a significant cost discount from purchasing new cubicles,” adding that cubicles from the correctional enterprise, on average, were “significantly” more expensive.
But auditors said the agency couldn’t show any documentation to prove that it assessed the cost of the correctional enterprise cubicles in advance, and the agency submitted “an email from June 2025, more than a year after the lease was awarded.”
Because furniture enhancements made up a majority of the costs, auditors argued that state officials “did not accurately represent” the deal when they brought it to the Board of Public Works, which ultimately approved it.
Before the Board, Maryland Secretary of the Environment Serena McIlwain praised environmental upgrades that were part of the lease, including a new solar panel array for the building and electrification upgrades. Board members, including Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) and Moore echoed her praise.
But auditors found that the solar panel cost was actually included in the base rent, meaning the agency will pay for it over the 20-year term.
“Almost all the costs were unrelated to energy savings,” reads the audit.
In a response to auditors, the Department of General Services, led by Secretary Atif Chaudhry, argued that it didn’t mislead the Board by leaning on the energy-related upgrades, since the “summary of items listed in the agenda was meant to highlight the significant portions of the new renovation project,” whether they were paid for by base rent or the $10 million improvement allowance given to the agency.
Auditors also reviewed a similar 20-year lease for the Maryland Energy Administration, which is also headquartered at Montgomery Park. But they did not issue any findings specific to the Energy Administration.
The far smaller agency will pay about $11.5 million over the term of its lease, approved shortly after the lease for the Department of the Environment. It is also moving to a renovated space in the building in coordination with the environmental agency’s larger renovation.

Auditors also disputed the rental rate for the Department of the Environment’s space at Montgomery Park, which includes several floors in the historic building. Between the end of the agency’s previous lease at the building in 2022, and the start of its current lease, the rental rate climbed from $20.84 per square foot to $22.54 per square foot, an 8.2% jump, auditors wrote. That resulted in the $12.6 million increase in least costs, auditors wrote.
The Department of General Services, in its response to the audit, argued that the lease was in a two-year “holdover period” while the current lease was being negotiated, during which Himmelrich Associates would have received a 4% rate increase ($0.84 per square foot), had the original rate increase from the prior lease stayed in effect.
“DGS negotiated a rent increase of $1.65 per square foot and reduced the escalation rate from 4% to 3.45%,” reads the agency’s response.
The agency added that its real estate broker determined the fair market rental rate was $26.06 per square foot, on average.
The lease’s two-decade length, escalating 3.45% each year, also attracted scrutiny in the audit, which noted that the other leases auditors reviewed “were generally for 10-year terms and none of the escalation rates exceeded 3%,” though auditors noted that the agency did not have a policy setting maximum lease terms or escalation rates.
In response, the agency argued it had the freedom to negotiate a longer-than-usual term, and the agency “has seen similar requests and need for extended lease terms for larger leased space requirements.” But the agency noted that the renovation budget factored into the lengthy term, noting that “the landlord was unable to obtain financing to provide the $10 million renovation budget without a 20 year lease.”
According to the Department of General Services, the landlord also had issues financing the renovation effort if the state had the right to terminate the lease for “convenience,” or if cancellation was in the state’s best interest. The agency wrote that nixing the clause was the “only option,” to get the renovations, noting that the space hasn’t been renovated since 2002.
Auditors said that the department failed to show a good enough reason for excluding the clause, a common provision for state leases.
“The only documentation DGS provided to us was a letter from the landlord’s bank ‘respectfully requesting’ that the clause be removed from the lease agreement,” auditors wrote. “Given the length of the lease and the significant increase in the lease costs, we question whether the exclusion of this provision was in the State’s best interest.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_1028-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-07-31 12:38:00.205060

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
 State regulations

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.
The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
 What do these programs look like across the country?

FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

Statehouse Democrats across the country are aiming to link their Republican counterparts to President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending cuts package. (Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)PITTSBURG, Kan. — Amid a summer swelter last week, more than 80 people crowded into a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburg, Kansas, for cold drinks and hot talk.
The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.


– Justin Mcelwain, Pittsburg, Kan., resident


Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
‘Not a bumper sticker bill’
The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
  Prof. Chris Cooper (Photo: wcu.edu)
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
Democrats ‘fight back’
This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

The governor’s office said the order would examine the highest-point tariff rate in 115 years.
“I have heard from countless Michiganders alarmed by the way Washington Republicans are handling tariffs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Tariffs have weakened Michigan supply chains, increased costs for family budgets, and caused major firms to scale back operations in Michigan.

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who is a candidate for governor, added that those rising prices are also hurting Michigan families, in addition to the business community.
“To protect Michiganders’ pocketbooks and grow our economy, we’re signing an executive directive to investigate how tariffs will affect our economy, including our factory workers and farmers,” Gilchrist said in a statement.
Within the next 30 days, the order directs various agencies to report to Whitmer’s office on current and future tariff impacts. Reports will be required from the departments of:

Agriculture and Rural Development;
Environment, Great Lakes and Energy;
Natural Resources;
Technology, Management and Budget;
Transportation and
the Michigan State Housing Development Authority

Additional departments, agencies and offices will be encouraged to also review data that might shed light on how tariffs would affect them and the economy writ large.

Whitmer’s office cited numerous examples of how Trump’s tariffs have hurt Michigan since returning to the Oval Office this year, with Stellantis and General Motors noting significant losses due to tariffs and Ford taking out a new line of credit due to economic uncertainty.
Coupled with the Michigan budget hole created separately by Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tariff hit could have wider consequences for the Great Lakes state. Food assistance and Medicaid programs were already on track for major cuts, and consumers will be among the hardest hit while companies pass on 60% of their tariff costs to average Michiganders.

(File photo by Abraham Kenmore/South Carolina Daily Gazette)This story first appeared on the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Whether South Carolina high school students have a constitutional right to take an advanced course on Black history was the central question in federal court Wednesday.
It was the first hearing on a lawsuit filed in January on behalf of students, educators, an author and the state NAACP that challenges a state law banning eight concepts from classroom lessons. The list of what can’t be taught includes that any race is inherently superior or automatically racist, that anyone is responsible for past atrocities because of their race, that someone’s worth is determined by race, and that traits such as hard work are oppressive and racist.
The concepts have been banned since 2021, when legislators inserted a directive titled “partisanship curriculum” into the state budget. While technically a one-year law, the clause has carried over to every budget since.
Education department officials pointed to the law last summer as among the reasons African American Studies wasn’t included on the state’s roster of Advanced Placement courses for the 2024-25 school year — the course’s inaugural year following a two-year pilot.
The lawsuit doesn’t directly challenge the omission of AP African American Studies, but the class was central to attorneys’ arguments.
NAACP attorney Charles McLaurin asked U.S. District Judge Sherri Lydon to strike the clause from the state budget while the lawsuit plays out. Education department attorney Miles Coleman asked Lydon to dismiss the case entirely, arguing students’ rights aren’t being violated.
Lydon made no decision Wednesday. She said she would decide as soon as possible whether to let the case continue and, if she does, whether to temporarily strike the budget clause.
AP African American Studies
McLaurin argued the state’s decision discriminated against Black students by removing a course showcasing their history.
Attorneys for the state noted some schools still offer an honors course in African American history, and students can still take the end-of-course AP exam to potentially earn college credit.
“There is nothing preventing districts from continuing to offer AP African American Studies as a locally-approved honors course should they choose to do so, in addition to continuing to offer other approved African American courses as districts have already done for a number of years,” reads a June 2024 memo written by Matthew Ferguson, then a deputy state superintendent, to local superintendents.
For students, the differences include dollars and GPA weightings.
The state doesn’t cover AP tests’ $98 cost for courses not on the Department of Education’s roster, meaning either students or their district must pay if they want to pursue college credit. And AP is a step above honors courses in GPA weightings, which matters for students competing for class rank and scholarships.

While AP African American Studies was open to any student in the pilot schools that offered it, the course was especially popular among Black students, NAACP attorney Maia Cole said. Because the classes focused on Black history, removing that option was a form of discrimination against Black students, she said.
In 2022-23, the first year the College Board tested its new AP course, one high school in South Carolina was picked for the pilot. As part of the pilot’s national expansion in 2023-24, 244 students in South Carolina took the AP African American Studies test, according to data from the education agency.
Not giving that option to students statewide once the College Board officially launched the course for 2024-25 violated students’ due process and equal protection rights in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, according to the lawsuit.
But students don’t necessarily have a constitutional right to learn about specific topics in schools, Coleman said.
Lydon seemed to agree. For instance, if a school decided not to teach students about Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech, that would be within the school’s rights, she said.
“That’s a knuckleheaded idea,” Lydon said. “It’s not smart. But they can do it.”
Coleman called the honors course an acceptable alternative for interested students. But McLaurin said the two are “dramatically different,” arguing the AP version is “far more in-depth and far more interdisciplinary.”
Some students also don’t have access to the honors course, which isn’t offered in every district, McLaurin said.
Not all AP courses on the state’s roster are available in every district either. Since 1984, state law has required high schools to offer the college-level courses, which can provide college credit for students who pass the end-of-course test. But which courses are available differs by high school, largely depending on the school’s population and number of teachers. Ten are available online through the state’s Virtual SC program, aimed at providing the opportunity for students in schools where those aren’t offered.
Since the state’s decision on AP African American Studies applied to all students, no single group lost out more than others, Coleman argued.
How much of a role the law actually played in that decision remains unclear, attorneys said.
Other factors, including a scheduled review of the state’s social studies standards, were also part of the considerations last year, Coleman said. He noted President Donald Trump’s executive order in January with similar requirements could affect decisions going forward.
Lydon said striking the budget clause wouldn’t guarantee students the right to enroll in the class.
If she instructed the education department to offer the course code again, school districts would not be obliged to offer the class, and some may decide to wait until the social studies review is complete anyway, she said.
To attorneys on both sides, Lydon asked what the limits might look like: Could schools remove any class with a semblance of controversy around it? Could students indefinitely sue their districts to add whatever classes they wanted to take?
For instance, the same June 2024 memo explaining the state’s decision on AP African American Studies noted the AP pre-calculus course didn’t make the state list either.

Lydon questioned whether siding with the NAACP’s arguments meant she might have to later rule that schools must offer AP pre-calculus as well.

“I may have a lot of cases before me,” Lydon said. “Forever and ever, am I going to have to approve the department’s decisions on social studies?”
The law’s line on students’ feelings
The lawsuit also claimed the budget clause led to the removal of books from lesson plans and school libraries.
Specifically, “Between the World and Me,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, was removed from a teacher’s curriculum in the Lexington-Richland 5 School District in 2023, and “Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You,” by Ibram X. Kendi, was removed from school libraries across the state, the lawsuit claimed.
Coleman argued Kendi, who is named as a plaintiff, had no constitutional right guaranteeing all of his books would be available in public school libraries. A review board cited factual errors as the reason to remove “Stamped,” while allowing other books by Kendi to stay, Coleman said.
Kendi didn’t lose out on money or have his reputation damaged because his book was no longer offered in the libraries, McLaurin said. Instead, his argument was based entirely on his First Amendment right to not have his books removed because of the viewpoint expressed in them, McLaurin said.
Teacher Mary Wood, one of the plaintiffs in the case, faced no real repercussions from the district after being asked to remove “Between the World and Me” from her curriculum, said Edward Bradley, an attorney representing the school district where she teaches. The district has renewed her contract every year since, and while she sat down with administrators to review her lesson plan, she has not faced any formal disciplinary action, he said.
The harm to Wood is primarily to her credibility as a teacher, McLaurin said. The debacle undermined her professional standing to colleagues, students and teachers, and she faced anxiety and fear over whether she might lose her job for breaking state law, he said.
The clause is too vague to actually enforce, McLaurin said.
Of the eight banned concepts, the one cited as the most troublesome says lessons can’t make anyone “feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race or sex.”
Teachers don’t know what lessons may get them in trouble based on students’ feelings, McLaurin said.
Legislators of both parties agreed that line in the budget clause could stifle instruction.
That’s why it was purposefully excluded from legislation that sought to clean up the law while creating a uniform complaint process.
As passed by the Senate in May 2023, the bill specifically protected “historically accurate” discussions on slavery, Reconstruction, the Jim Crow era, segregation, racial lynchings, and any “historical oppression of a particular group of people based on race, sex, ethnicity, class, nationality, religion, or geographic region.”
If the measure had passed, it would have superseded the budget clause.
But opponents who packed hearings argued it would create fear among teachers about what they could teach, censor lessons, and discriminate. They succeeded in killing the bill, which officially died with the end of the 2024 session.
Many perhaps did not realize that what they fought was already state law through the budget. And the bill’s defeat kept that directive intact — with the line on students’ feelings and without clarifications for teachers on what’s allowed.

The 20 workers at Boise Cascade’s Billings, Montana, facility walked off the job early Tuesday evening, citing management’s refusal to offer a fair contract. The strike follows a  breakdown in talks after the company failed to address workers’ concerns over stagnant pay and inadequate health care coverage.

“Boise Cascade has enjoyed strong profits year after year, yet those gains have not been reflected in the wages of the very people who keep operations running,” said James Soumas, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Union Local No. 190. “Our members are standing up to demand wages that reflect the rising cost of living and competitive environment and health care that won’t bankrupt families.”
Teamsters Local No. 190 has been engaged in contract negotiations with Boise Cascade for several months. Despite efforts to reach a fair agreement, the company has not made a serious offer addressing core issues, according to union officials representing the employees.
About a half-dozen employees were on the picket line Wednesday afternoon, pointing out the lumber yard on the West end of Billings was silent.
“Look at that one truck,” said one union member, who declined to give his name out of fear of retribution. “There’s more than $50,000 of lumber sitting on it, idle. I think they can offer fair wages.”
Officials at Boise Cascade’s headquarters were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.
However, according to the end-of-the-year report to investors, Boise Cascade showed that sales decreased 2% from $6.83 billion to $6.72 billion, and earnings per share fell 21%, driven in large part by a cooling in the U.S. residential housing market. CEO Nate Jorgensen noted that many uncertainties surrounded the beginning of 2025, including an uncertain housing market as well as global trade issues.
“We don’t want to be out here on the picket line, but we won’t accept a deal that sells us short. We deserve respect, stability and a future,” said Zeb Plovanic, a longtime employee at the facility.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)This summer the Trump administration’s Department of Justice sent letters to election officials in several states, including Nevada, asking them to provide lists of registered voters and other information, part of the Trump administration’s threat that states better fall in line with the DOJ’s quest to discredit elections in the U.S. or else.
At least two states have told the DOJ to buzz off.
New Hampshire’s secretary of state, a Republican, informed the DOJ that state law “authorizes the Secretary of State to release the statewide voter registration list in limited circumstances not applicable here.”
Maine’s secretary of state, a Democrat who is running for governor, responded slightly less formally, suggesting the DOJ can “Go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
In Nevada, the statewide voter registration list is public information, so Nevada Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar sent it the DOJ.
The DOJ’s request to Nevada also asked Aguilar’s office to describe processes for making sure deceased registrants, noncitizen registrants, and voters who have moved out of the state aren’t voting.
Those requests echo unproven allegations routinely but unfoundedly tossed around in Nevada over the years by Trump’s campaign and his minions, especially after Trump lost the state to Joe Biden in 2020.
The Nevada SOS office’s response, sent to the DOJ last week, referred the DOJ to state statutes and described procedures to safeguard the accuracy of voter registration lists — the sort of procedures state and local officials have described in forums, panels and such on multiple occasions in recent years. In other words, more stuff that is already public information in Nevada.
Meanwhile, the DOJ’s Criminal Division sent a separate request via email to the Nevada SOS office on July 10 seeking “a potential information-sharing agreement” on ineligible voters or voters who “may have” committed fraud or “engaged in unlawful conduct relevant to the election process.”
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” reads the email to the state from the DOJ’s Criminal Division.
Both the June and July requests to Nevada from the DOJ stem from an executive order Trump issued in March on “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” 
Reminder: Over the last decade, each and every one of the thousands upon thousands of times Trump has spoken about election integrity, his aim has not been to preserve and protect elections, but to undermine and delegitimize them and disenfranchise voters.
Those are Trump’s goals now, in ordering (executive ordering, to be precise) U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice to meddle in elections in Nevada and other states.
Like the DOJ’s request to Nevada — and like Trump’s demagoguery over the last ten years — Trump’s March executive order suggests voter fraud is rampant. Voter fraud is in fact exceedingly rare. But unlike delegitimizing democracy and disenfranchising voters, truth and accuracy have never been Trump priorities.
“The White House tried to overhaul our election system through an unconstitutional executive order,” said Joanna Lydgate, CEO of the nonprofit States United Democracy Center, in a statement this week. 
“As federal agencies like the DOJ push to implement it, they’re reaching past their authority and furthering the same lies about our elections that the order is based on,” Lydgate said.
Nice little democracy you got there…
Under Trump’s order/threat, if states don’t do as the DOJ asks (no matter how unconstitutional) U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is ordered to…
…prioritize enforcement of Federal election integrity laws in such States to ensure election integrity given the State’s demonstrated unwillingness to enter into an information-sharing agreement or to cooperate in investigations and prosecutions.
The underlying premise of Trump’s executive order and the DOJ letters is that U.S. elections can’t be trusted. Like so much of what Trump has said or posted on social media over the years, that’s a lie. 
Nevada Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford and his California counterpart, Ron Bonta, are co-leaders of a suit filed by multiple attorneys general that claims Trump’s executive order on elections is unconstitutional.
A joint press release announcing that suit in April included quotes from Aguilar calling Trump’s executive order “an unlawful attempt to grab power from both the states and Congress.”
“The United States Constitution is clear: states have primary responsibility for the administration of elections,” Aguilar said in the release. “Even worse, the order is backed by threats to take away funding for election security and integrity.”
Aguilar was referring to the executive order’s promise to take federal election money away from states that don’t comply with its commands and directives.
Nevada needs to tell Trump where he can put his election order

Federal spending on elections is pitifully small, and from the moment Trump issued his order the obvious thing for states to do, along with suing him, was to tell him to shove it.
Aguilar’s office has not responded to the DOJ’s cheeky July 10 email asking the Nevada secretary of state’s office to voluntarily cooperate with a scheme (some of which has already been halted by courts) to assault voting rights and further erode public faith in democracy — the Trump objectives driving the DOJ’s correspondence.
Pollsters and the Democratic consultants who love them tell us most voters don’t really care about democracy all that much. That may be true. A critical mass of today’s voters seem likely to be more enthusiastic about the prospect of a WWF show on the White House lawn than free and fair elections.
But Aguilar’s job doesn’t (or shouldn’t) afford him the luxury of whistling in the dark while U.S. democracy continues its backslide into a “competitive authoritarianism” where there are still elections, but just for show.
Since his election in 2022, Aguilar had demonstrated a (not always welcome) fondness for comity and good manners. If and when he responds to Trump’s bullyboy threats, the appropriate thing for Aguilar to do would be to jettison the politeness, and tell Trump and the DOJ stooges to to go jump in the Gulf of … oh, let’s say … Mexico.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2195033504-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 11:58:44.916800

(Photo courtesy USFS)On Wednesday, the Santa Fe National Forest announced continued progress on the Laguna Fire burning in Rio Arriba County, saying the blaze is more than three-quarters contained and that increased humidity and low temperatures “reduced fire behavior to creeping and smoldering.”
Yet even while the fire nears containment, it continues to draw controversy and criticism due to how it developed in the first place. Internal U.S. Forest Service documents reviewed by Source reveal an attempt this week by the agency to disseminate talking points about the situation.
Based on the Forest Service’s previous statements, the fire was never supposed to be greater than 13,000 acres, and it was supposed to stay within a designated “focus area” with a boundary west of the ridgeline of Laguna Peak. 
Instead, the fire footprint grew about three miles northeast of that boundary. As it grew uncontrolled, the blaze  “killed and maimed the livestock of local ranchers,” according to U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM). It also imperiled the lives of two firefighters, according to Forest Service documents. 
Source New Mexico compiled Forest Service maps showing exactly how far outside of the management zone the fire spread. It also reviewed internal guidance documents provided to firefighters after the blaze escaped its “focus area.” 
The internal documents Source reviewed include the firefighters’ daily briefing from July 29, which contains “talking points,” alongside weather forecasts and instructions for filing expense reports. The talking points include:
“The fire was successfully managed until July 12 when the fire grew significantly, driven by an unpredicted change in weather,” and;
“The two firefighters cleared a large area with the dozer and deployed their shelters. No significant injuries were sustained, and the dozer remained completely intact.” 
Dear President Trump: NM delegation calls out federal administration

Around 2:30 p.m. on July 12, according to the Wildfire Lessons Learned Center, two firefighters were actively suppressing the fire near the escape boundaries when “strong outflowwinds from a passing thunderstorm caused rapid fire growth in the area.” The growth “entrapped” two firefighters who were working in a dozer, who then deployed their fire shelters to escape injury. 
While the firefighters emerged without significant injuries, the “potential gravity of the situation” will result in more intensive review than is typical, according to the center. The review, called a “facilitated learning analysis,” does not result in punitive actions but is designed for incidents that have “implications for a broader audience and are rich with organizational learning opportunities,” according to Forest Service guidance.
The fire’s escape comes amid cuts to Forest Service personnel and as Northern New Mexicans “have completely lost trust in the agency’s wildfire decision-making given the Forest Service’s recent history,” according to a letter Leger Fernandez wrote to Forest Chief Tom Schultz last week. 
She was referring to the Forest Service’s accidental ignition of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire in 2022, which became the biggest wildfire in New Mexico history. The letter seeks answers from Schultz about whether the agency was short-staffed and if the agency intends to compensate ranchers for their cattle, which she said provide the “livelihood of our rural communities in New Mexico.”
“I hoped that the Forest Service could make strides in the long process of restoring the community’s trust. This incident indicates the Forest Service is failing,” she wrote.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screen-Shot-2025-07-31-at-9.21.57-AM-1024x683.png,,,2025-07-31 11:58:44.916800

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Supreme Court proceeding)TOPEKA — A Kansas woman owes more than $21,000 in late fees for failing to pay her rent in 2020, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled last week.
Sherri Foster rented a Prairie Village house in November 2018, paying $1,900 per month in rent to John Schutt. Schutt also employed Foster to work on renovations of rental properties, attorney Jadh Kerr told Supreme Court justices. 
“The lease had a late-fee provision that $20 for each day was due for rents that remain unpaid after the due date, which is the first of the month,” Kerr said. 
Foster did not pay rent for three months in early 2020, but she and Schutt agreed to bring her current as of June 2020, Kerr said. Foster again missed three months of rent, which ultimately brought the two before the Johnson County District Court. 
“Normally, under a landlord-tenant action, you would go to trial within 14 days,” Kerr said. “That did not happen here. It took from September of 2020 to March 2 of 2023 for this case to get to trial.”
The district court ruled that Foster owed $5,700 in unpaid rent and $21,240 in late fees, which was calculated by assessing $20 per day for 1,062 days between the first missed rent payment and the judgment date.
However, Schutt also owed Foster $545 for failing to pay her for managing construction work on his rental properties, according to court documents.
Foster’s attorney Eric Kraft appealed the district court ruling to the Kansas Court of Appeals, claiming that $21,000 in late fees was “unconscionable,” a legal term meaning a contract is so unfair or oppressive for one party that it offends the conscience of the court. In Kansas, the Consumer Protection Law focuses on “misleading, deceptive and unconscionable trade practices.”
The appeals court agreed with Foster and lowered the late fee assessment to $1,700, which covered the days between when Foster failed to pay her rent and when the case went before the district court. But Schutt then appealed that decision to the Kansas Supreme Court.
Kraft said the district court judge, John McEntee, was new, and Kraft believed the former judge in district court would have limited the late fees.
“As much as we try to protect the tenants in the landlord and tenant act, this smacks that completely upside down,” Kraft told the Supreme Court. 
While Supreme Court justices peppered Schutt’s lawyer with questions about the fairness of late fees accruing through an unusually long court proceeding, they ultimately found in favor of Schutt.
The unanimous decision from the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court’s decision. It said that Foster did not appropriately raise the issue of unconscionability, and the Court of Appeals should not have taken that into account when reversing the district court’s initial decision.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kansas-renter-1024x525.png,,,2025-07-31 11:58:44.916800

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Investigate Midwest)Jack Link’s, the world’s largest manufacturer of meat snacks, has spent years integrating itself into the country’s cultural and political arenas.
Riding a wave of protein-crazed consumers and a booming snack industry, the company’s iconic Sasquatch marketing campaign has helped its products become a staple in gas stations, grocery checkout lines and school vending machines.
The company has also spent years cultivating deep political ties, funneling millions to Trump and nurturing a relationship with the president that has led to White House access.
Trump has been a strong supporter of the meat industry and welcomed Jack Link’s officials to a White House event during his first term. However, the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement is currently pushing for healthier eating standards and for states to restrict processed foods in their nutrition programs.
Now, Jack Link’s and the processed meat industry are caught between conflicting ideologies within the Trump administration and a battle over the future of food policy.

“There’s very much a conflict within this administration about the role of corporate power and public health,” said Judith McGeary, executive director of the Texas-based sustainable agriculture and farmer advocacy group Farm and Ranch Freedom Alliance.
In May, the federal MAHA commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recommended in a new report that Americans consume fewer sugary drinks, snacks and processed foods.
While the report didn’t specifically mention processed meat snacks, it grabbed the attention of snack giants like Jack Link’s and other corporate agriculture groups, which are opposed to any additional regulations or changes to the food industry, McGeary said.
The report did note that low-income children and families consume more processed meat than their peers and that these products have been classified as carcinogens linked to serious health risks.

Kennedy, along with U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, has encouraged states to restrict what foods can be purchased with benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
States, from West Virginia to California, have responded by approving bans that limit purchases of sugary beverages, snacks and foods with dyes and artificial ingredients.
Jack Link’s responded by hiring a lobbying firm, a move that paid off when it faced increased regulations during Trump’s first term
Jack Link’s benefits from political, consumer trends
Minong, Wisconsin — a small, rural village in the state’s northwestern tip, home to taverns, gravel roads, rows of northern Wisconsin pine trees, and plenty of grazing land for beef cattle — is one of dozens of small towns across the state with roots in the cattle and lumber industries.
Minong is also home to a Bigfoot-sized footprint of Jack Link’s that is hard to ignore.
Jack Link’s, owned by Link Snacks, is a $2 billion, privately-owned company with dual headquarters in Minong and downtown Minneapolis, a few hours away.

The company employs roughly 4,000 people worldwide. Jack Link’s leadership has long served on local college and hospital boards and, in 2016, broke ground the Jack Link’s Aquatic & Activity Center in Minong.
What started in the late 1980s as a family-owned jerky company has evolved into a global enterprise with offices and production plants in Canada, Australia, Mexico and Brazil.

Troy Link, son of company founder and current board member John “Jack” Link, has led the company’s global expansion since he became CEO in 2013.
Link has also developed a relationship with the Trump administration over the years by hosting private fundraising events and donating to his campaigns.
Last year, Link also donated half a million dollars to America PAC, a political action committee founded and operated by Elon Musk, according to Federal Elections Committee filings.
This donation placed Link amongst a highly influential group of donors and prominent technology and cryptocurrency industry moguls, such as Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.
Link donated $1.3 million during Trump’s 2020 re-election bid and also welcomed the president to a private fundraiser in July 2020 at his Florida mansion.

As a whole, the Link family has donated roughly $2.3 million to candidates, committees and state parties in the last decade. The majority of this occurred during the 2020 and 2024 Trump campaigns.
In 2018, the company was invited to the White House as part of a “Made In America” exhibition, where each state showcased a single business with products made in the country.
Troy Link did not respond to repeated requests for comment regarding the relationship of Jack Link’s and the Trump administration.
This relationship with politicians has served the company in the past. In Trump’s first term, Jack Link’s lobbied for beef jerky and meat snack sticks to qualify for the nation’s Child Nutrition Programs, such as school meals.
An Obama-era rule prohibited the reimbursement of beef jerky and dried meat products for school food purchases in 2011. When the rules were revisited under Trump in 2018, Jack Link’s argued in documents submitted to the USDA that dried meat products should receive the same crediting and treatment as other meat, like hamburgers and chicken strips.
“These food products should be held to the same standard as any other meat product when determining eligibility,” a Jack Link’s attorney wrote. “Currently, this is not the case because USDA has arbitrarily disqualified dried meat products from the program.”
A bipartisan trio of Wisconsin federal officials came to the aid of Jack Link’s during this regulatory update, with Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, and former Congressman and current U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy writing in support of this change soon after.
“We are concerned that (Food and Nutrition Service) has overstepped in excluding this entire product class from consideration,” the officials wrote in a February 2018 letter. “Therefore, we respectfully request USDA to reevaluate this categorical exclusion.”
Link family members donated a combined $73,000 to the authors of the letter.
The lobbying effort worked. The Food and Nutrition Service announced in December 2018 that beef jerky and dried meat products were now eligible for reimbursement as part of school snacks and meals. Jack Link’s currently markets its snacks directly to school food purchasers.

The addition of school contracts and other market growth helped fuel the company’s expansion.
In recent years, Jack Link’s has broken ground on new manufacturing facilities across the country and purchased jerky companies from Tyson Foods and British packaged goods giant Unilever.
The company also launched Lorissa’s Kitchen, a healthy meat snack brand fronted by Troy’s spouse, Lorissa, and sold at Walmart and Costco nationwide. The brand differentiates itself from Jack Link’s by selling snacks “without added preservatives, nitrites or MSG and allergen-free products,” according to company media statements.
During the 2024 Republican National Convention, Link also appeared on a Fox News business segment to argue that inflation under Biden was making it more expensive for consumers to purchase snacks.
“Buying snacks should not be a luxury item; this should be an everyday occurrence,” Link said. “We just need to put more money back into the consumer’s pocket.
Protein snacks boom amidst calls to reduce meat consumption
As Jack Link’s worked to build a close relationship with the Trump administration, meat consumption was booming, especially thanks to right-wing influencers.
Online personalities, such as podcast hosts Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson, have advocated for all-meat diets, including raw meat and eggs.
The connection between meat consumption and conservative politics dates back decades, according to food studies researcher Adrienne Bitar.
“Higher meat consumption has always been understood as sort of more conservative,” said Bitar, author of “Diet and the Disease of Civilization.”
“Where it comes up in the alt-right is the idea that the feminizing effects of civilization are unnatural, restrictive, repressive, and to liberate yourself from the accoutrements of civilization means to follow your appetite, with the hunger for meat being one of those appetites.”
Meat snacks sales increased 40% from 2019 to 2022, according to an industry report. The desire for more protein-dense snacks has risen across the entire food sector, from protein-packed popcorn to chocolate muffins.
However, the nation’s protein consumption far outpaces that of similar nations and needs to be reassessed, according to grocery experts and leading nutritionists.
“Unless you’re a competitive athlete or competitive bodybuilder, you’re probably eating too much protein,” said Errol Schweizer, publisher of The Checkout Grocery Update, a grocery industry publication, and former vice president of grocery for the multinational supermarket Whole Foods.

Schweizer said the popularity of protein snacks has ebbed and flowed with American consumers, following the trends of certain diets and lifestyles over the past few decades. U.S. consumers are “obsessed” with protein intake, he said, and typically have diets that consist of fewer fresh fruits, vegetables, fiber and healthy fats.
Schweizer’s observations align with the nation’s blueprint for diet and nutrition.
Updated every five years, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans helps shape national standards nutrition labeling, school meals and chronic disease prevention.
In October 2024, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, a 20-person group of nutrition experts, released its recommended updates to both the USDA and the HHS. Now those two agencies will review recommendations and public comments to set the final dietary guidelines later this year.
Since 2000, the panel has consistently urged Americans to cut back on red and processed meats in favor of lean meat, seafood and plant-based proteins.
The committee’s 2024 report recommends diets “lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains and saturated fats.”
The country’s leading meat industry group, The Meat Institute, whose members include Jack Link’s and other major meatpacking and meat snack companies, has argued against the committee’s recommendations.

“The Meat Institute is extremely concerned that consumers will inaccurately perceive meat and poultry products as poor dietary choices, which may lead to a variety of unintended consequences, including nutritional deficiencies in certain sub-populations,” the Virginia-based group wrote to the HHS in February.
The National Pork Board, the pork checkoff organization based in Clive, Iowa, wrote to the health department in February, stating that recommendations to reduce consumption of red meats are short-sighted and efforts to push foods such as legumes and beans over meats “does not seem to be supported by a robust body of evidence.”
“The elevation of plant-based protein sources over lean meats could inadvertently discourage the consumption of nutrient-dense lean meats, thus increasing the risk of nutritional deficiencies,” the letter stated.
In its inaugural report, the MAHA Commission wrote that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans has a “history of being unduly influenced by corporate interests,” noting how a past attempt to reduce the push for reducing intake of processed meats has been met with backlash and scientific discrediting from the meat industry.
Processed food industry fortifies as feds debate SNAP, diet guidelines
In late June, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, flanked by Kennedy in the state capitol, announced a sweeping set of executive orders to remove processed foods and foods with additives from the state’s nutrition programs.

“For far too long, we have settled for food that has made us sicker as a nation,” said Stitt at a June press event. “In Oklahoma, we’re choosing common sense, medical freedom, and personal responsibility. President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have led the charge nationally; I’m grateful for their support as we Make Oklahoma Healthy Again.”
Other states have followed suit with Arkansas, Indiana, West Virginia and California enacting bans on processed foods from SNAP purchases, or are exploring ways to reduce ultra-processed foods in the state, often with the support of Kennedy and Rollins and other federal leaders.
However, Joelle Johnson, deputy director for the food and nutrition consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, said despite growing debates about ultra-processed foods in the nation’s food programs, there is a lack of clear guidance from the federal government to retailers and food purchasers about what would and wouldn’t qualify as being ultra-processed.
“I would be surprised if we see bans of ultra-processed foods in SNAP, beyond candy and sweetened beverages, anytime soon,” she said.
Still, major snack and processed food companies, including Jack Link’s, are bracing for any changes that could harm their sales.
Consumer Brands Association, a Virginia-based organization representing major packaged food companies, including Tyson Foods and Coca-Cola, spent $42 million in lobbying over the past decade, focusing on issues including SNAP funding and dietary guidelines, among other issues.
Since 2023, the organization has worked with lobbyist Clete Willems, the deputy assistant of international economics during Trump’s first term and a former Obama administration official, according to lobbying disclosure documents.
Conagra Brands, the publicly-traded, packaged food conglomerate that owns major brands such as Slim Jims, Orville Redenbacher, Bird’s Eye Frozen Foods and Reddi-Whip, spent over half a million dollars in the past year lobbying federal officials and has spent $4.6 million in lobbying in the past decade. Conagra and Consumer Brands Association did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
In April, Link Snacks, the parent company of Jack Link’s, hired lobbying firm Bockorny Group, which has also represented the meatpacking company Agri-Beef Co. and pork industry publication National Hog Farmer. This was the first time the beef jerky giant has lobbied federal officials.

Lobbyists working for Jack Links include Pete Lawson, a former VP for Ford Motors and staff attorney for Virginia Democratic congressman Jim Moran, and Eric Bohl, a former staffer for the  congressional offices of Missouri republicans Vicky Hartzler and Jason Smith, who worked on the 2014 Farm Bill.
This year, Link Snacks has spent $25,000 on lobbying the federal government to support “protein snacks in SNAP program” as well as issues with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, according to lobbying disclosure documents.

Although there’s still a long way to go to improve affordability, coverage and health outcomes, for years we made measurable progress in expanding and improving Medicaid and Medicare that gave us something to celebrate every July 30th, the date that commemorates the day Medicaid and Medicare were signed into law.
But this year is different.
As Medicaid and Medicare turn 60, much of this progress is on the chopping block because of a new law just signed by President Trump on the 4th of July. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act makes historically large cuts to Medicaid – over $1 trillion – and triggers a $490 billion cut to Medicare over the next ten years. Rather than building on the legacy of success that have made these programs among the most popular in America, the new law makes massive cuts in order to fund a different priority:  more tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations.
Tax giveaways to the wealthy and Wall Street cost the rest of us. And, in the case of the OBBBA, we’re largely paying with our healthcare.
In North Carolina, over 3,000,000 persons depend on Medicaid, including more than 660,000 who got coverage under the ACA’s expansion provisions that enabled low wage working adults, contractors, small businesspeople, and veterans to access the program for the first time.
That includes Trina Longacre, an Action NC member who survived serious domestic violence only to be unable to undergo needed surgeries to recovery from her extensive injuries due to falling into North Carolina’s Medicaid gap. She is now insured thanks to Medicaid expansion, but still suffers pain and decreased mobility from not having had those surgeries when they were needed. She worries that the new cuts could affect her eligibility, and that of other abuse survivors. A significant number of the members of our organization have similar concerns about how these huge cuts will affect them and their families.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has announced that over 10 million people will lose Medicaid coverage because of the new law. In North Carolina, 272,000 people will lose Medicaid once the OBBBA is fully implemented.  Those losses won’t be limited to just the Medicaid expansion population – children, people with disabilities, seniors and healthcare providers will all be impacted
About half of U.S. children are insured under Medicaid and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program), which is also cut under the new law. Enrolling children – like everyone else – is about to get much more complicated, which means kids will lose coverage. Since children are entirely dependent on their parents for economic security and basic needs, children whose parents lose coverage, or services will be impacted because they live in the household.
People with disabilities and seniors who are dual eligible for Medicaid and Medicare also face risk. Over 1.3 million of these people are expected to lose coverage because of new paperwork and enrollment requirements. These are low-income people, many of whom have disabilities and who need long-term care services through Medicaid because Medicare doesn’t pay for long-term care or home-based services for people with disabilities.
The impact of the OBBBA goes well beyond just those who are covered under Medicaid – it will impact the whole healthcare system because, in addition to cutting coverage, it also starves health care providers of funding they need to stay open. Hospitals, clinics and even nursing homes—especially in underserved areas like rural communities—are expected to either reduce services or shut down entirely. More than 300 rural hospitals are currently at “immediate risk” of closure under the OBBBA including five in North Carolina.
Shutting down providers costs jobs and reduces economic activity. It also reduces access for everyone: regardless of what kind of coverage you have, you can’t go to the doctor if there’s no doctor around. Cutting Medicaid means many people will travel farther, have to change doctors, and wait longer for services.
So, while drug manufacturers, oil companies and Amazon may be celebrating more massive tax breaks, the rest of us are commemorating this year’s Medicaid and Medicare anniversary with a lot more worry.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Medicare-Getty-Images-1024x765.jpeg,,,2025-07-31 11:58:44.916800

House Bill 4760, also known as the “Justice Needs No Mask” bill, was unveiled last week by state Rep. Betsy Coffia (D-Traverse City) in response to growing public concern over masked, unidentified federal agents conducting immigration raids and detentions across the country.
Coffia told the Michigan Advance that while some of her GOP colleagues in the House had privately said they were disturbed by the increasing use of masked federal agents to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy, she was less confident any of them would publicly support the legislation.

On Saturday, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) made it clear his caucus would not pass what he called “an attack” on law enforcement efforts in Michigan.
“The people want these dangerous criminal aliens off our street, and we are doing everything we can to partner with the Trump administration and put an end to illegal immigration. Democrats will do everything they can to get in the way of local police and ICE, because they’ve always cared more about criminals than victims. But that ends here – this ridiculous bill is dead on arrival,” Hall said in a press release.
Reiterating that stance, the bill was  referred to the House Government Operations Committee, a traditional dumping ground for dead-end legislation.
Coffia fired back at Hall, telling the Advance that Hall’s statement was “full of the same tired right wing lies,” and that House Republicans’ inability to put forward a state budget plan was a far greater threat to law enforcement.
“Speaking of backing the blue, if Matt Hall continues to fail to pass a budget out of the Republican controlled House chamber, our state police and local school resource officers won’t have the funds they need,” Coffia said.
While the Democratic-led Michigan Senate has passed a full budget, lawmakers blew past the state’s July 1 deadline for a completed and signed deal, as the House has only passed an education spending plan but not a full budget funding all of state government. 
Coffia said the $20 billion stopgap spending plan passed by House Republicans in March, which would maintain government services in the event of a government shutdown, would cut the Michigan State Police budget by 37.4%. 
As to the mask bill, Coffia said it is not an isolated effort.
“My bill is one of several from state legislatures across the country challenging the Trump administration’s use of masked unmarked secret police tactics and demands that they function the way our local and state police do every single day – faces and badges visible,” Coffia said.
The bill also echoes federal legislation introduced by U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), as well as an effort including Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who has joined other attorneys general in pushing for a similar federal standard.

(Vicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography via Getty Images) A group of anglers is calling on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order to protect menhaden, a protein-rich forage fish, from overfishing, which they say has led to the species’ declining population and puts the food chain in the Chesapeake Bay at risk. Reliable data on how menhaden harvests impact other species in the bay is not available, despite multiple attempts to fund a state-level study.
“So at this point, we’ve had enough. It is time for strong executive action to put America first by protecting these important forge fish,” said Steve Atkinson, chairman of the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association.  ”Leave them in the water where they can fulfill their ecological role and protect Virginia’s billion dollar recreational fishing economy.”
Virginia is the only state that allows industrial-scale menhaden fishing on the East Coast. The group is asking the president to ban industrial reduction fishing to preserve not only the bait fish but the other species that rely on menhaden, herring, and other forage fish on the Atlantic coast. The fishermen say state legislative leaders may not have the capacity or willingness to enact such protections. 
“Most of our politicians don’t understand the importance of this fish, and in fact, many of them don’t know the difference between a menhaden and an oyster to be honest,” Atkinson said.  ”They have a lot of issues they deal with, and they’re not always open to spend a lot of time learning about this. And we’ve been trying, but it’s a challenge.”
Atkinson claimed that Canadian-led industrial fishing of menhaden is decimating the stripped bass populations in the Chesapeake Bay. His claims are rooted in past lawsuits that alleged the Bay’s only industrial menhaden harvester, Omega Protein, was foreign-owned. 
A 2021 lawsuit that has since been dismissed was brought by two environmental and conservation investigators. The federal government opted to stay out of the case and allowed it to play out in the southern district of New York. Canada-based Cooke Inc. bought Omega Protein, based in Reedville, Virginia, in 2017. The vessel operators who catch the fish for Omega were part of a business called Ocean Harvesters which is owned by Cooke, based in the U.S. and run by the American nephew of Cooke’s CEO, Glenn Cooke. The case was thrown out by the judge in January of this year, WAVY reported.
The attorney for the two men, Brendon DeMay, said the case was thrown out because of technicalities and not ruled on based on the merits of the allegations. He said in a press conference he will continue to try to prove those claims through the appeals process.
Atkinson and Phil Zalesak, the president of the Southern Maryland Recreational Fishing Organization, appeared in a video President Trump posted to Truth Social earlier this month. They bolstered the claims that foreign counties were intruding on the sportfishing industry and that the declining population is harming Virginia businesses.
“This action will reestablish a $10 billion striped bass business based industry on the Atlantic coast and lead to the employment of thousands of fishermen and business owners along the coast,” Zalesak said. “This action will also end foreign exploitation of the U.S. Natural resources to the benefit of the environment in the U.S. economy.”
The Virginia General Assembly has tried to pass legislation to study the impact of menhaden fishing on the reportedly declining menhaden population. The goal: to find out if the industrial fishing of these fish is the reason for the population decline or if it is due to other factors. A proposed $3 million study failed to pass out of the House of Delegates this year when it was cut during budget negotiations.
After concerns surfaced about the menhaden population impacting the food chain in the bay, the cap for menhaden harvest was lowered to 51,000 metric tons in 2017 by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Omega busted that cap by 33% in 2019, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
“If everyone would have a piece of the pie and we could all exist then there would be a little bit more harmony, and this treasured resource, these menhaden fish, wouldn’t be so exploited,” Vinnie Calabro, the owner of Karen Ann Charters and a commercial striped bass fisherman, said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act established a national tax credit scholarship program, but state leaders can decide whether and how to participate (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
 State regulations

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.
The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
 What do these programs look like across the country?

FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Photo courtesy of USDA /Cecilio Ricardo)U.S. Forest Service offices in Portland charged with wildfire prevention, scientific research, forestland management and conservation across the Northwest would be shuttered and moved out of state under a new plan announced by the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
In a July 24 memo, Brooke Rollins, head of the agriculture department that  oversees the Forest Service, outlined an agency restructuring plan that includes closing all nine regional Forest Service offices across the country — including the Region 6 headquarters in Portland — and moving their functions over the next year to five “hub locations.” Those are: Fort Collins, Colorado; Indianapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Salt Lake City.
The Forest Service’s 100-year-old Pacific Northwest Research Station in Portland, along with six other research stations across the country, are also slated to be closed and consolidated, with their functions moved to the USDA hub in Fort Collins, according to the memo.
“Implementation activities will take into consideration the ongoing fire season,” Rollins wrote.
The number of employees working for the U.S. Forest Service Northwest Region Headquarters is unclear and agency spokespersons did not provide a number via email. There are roughly 246 permanent, full-time employees, mostly scientists, employed by the Pacific Northwest Research Station, according to its website. Offices for both are located in Portland. It’s unclear if employees would be able to keep their jobs and relocate or if there will be cuts.
Rollins in her memo said the agency is “not conducting a large-scale workforce reduction.”
In an email to the Capital Chronicle, an unnamed USDA spokesperson for the Forest Service Region 6 office said Rollins’ announcement last week was a “first step.”
“Some aspects of the reorganization will take place over the coming months, while others will take more time,” they wrote. “We recognize this change may be difficult, but we are hopeful that affected employees will remain with us through this transition as we work to improve, and continue delivering benefits to the people and communities we serve.”
Oregon’s senior U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, called the plan “inane,” in an email, and said he would fight it.
“You don’t have to look at a map to know that Utah and Colorado are hundreds of miles away from the Pacific Northwest and thus much less accessible on the ground to Oregonians’ needs,” he said. “This latest Trump administration proposal shutting down the Oregon office for the Forest Service takes direct aim at quality of life in rural Oregon.”

Rollins said the restructuring was meant to cut agency spending by moving staff to cities with a lower cost of living and “refocusing its (USDA’s) core operations to better align with its founding mission of supporting American farming, ranching, and forestry.”
About 4,600 people work at the department’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., according to the memo. Rollins said this would be reduced to 2,000 as employees are moved to hub cities.
The five new hub cities were chosen for their “existing concentrations of current USDA employees,” a lower cost of living than D.C. and to “ensure USDA is located closer to the people it serves while achieving savings to the American taxpayer,” she wrote.
There are about 100,000 employees of the USDA nationwide, and about 30,000 are employees of the U.S. Forest Service. More than 15,300 people have left the agency under the Trump administration’s deferred resignation program, Rollins said.
 Impact

Officials at the Oregon Department of Forestry have not been in conversation with USDA or Forestry Service officials about the proposed changes, according to Joy Krawczyk, a spokesperson for the state forestry department. She said moving the offices out of Portland would be inconvenient but not detrimental to the collaborative work between the state and federal agencies.
“While not having the regional office in Portland would certainly be less convenient for in-person interactions, the ability to coordinate and collaborate isn’t as limited by physical proximity today as it was pre-COVID,” Krawczyk said. “ODF and our partner agencies regularly and effectively use the variety of virtual communication tools available to us. We’ll also continue to work closely at the local level with the many USFS ranger districts across the state.”
Tom DeLuca, dean of Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, said students at the college work collaboratively on projects and research with staff from both the U.S. Forest Service Northwest Headquarters and the Northwest Research Station. Many students end up going on to work for the Forest Service after undertaking studies with federal scientists and staff.
DeLuca said closing the Oregon offices and moving their functions out of state would likely make that collaboration more difficult, and more expensive. He said these are costs that would also be borne by Northwest foresters, who would lose the technical support and ongoing research and monitoring work that offices do to improve forest ecosystems, study pests, boost timber production and respond to a changing climate.
“Secretary Rollins specifically stated that one of the objectives was to put the offices where the farmers are by moving people from D.C. to other locations. Yet for the U.S. Forest Service, it takes them out of the specific locations where there is a lot of forest management,” DeLuca said. “It’s a decision that feels very much like a centralized, D.C.-based decision masquerading as a decision for foresters and farmers, and that’s not meeting the needs of the foresters.”

(Photo by Michael Swensen/Getty Images)The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied some assistance for Kentucky counties affected by severe storms and tornadoes earlier this year, but the Beshear administration plans to appeal the decisions. 
The federal agency denied individual assistance for Christian and Todd counties and public assistance for Leslie County. FEMA also denied requests for the Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant Program, which funds long-term solutions to reduce the impact of future disasters, for both April flooding and the May tornadoes.
FEMA’s individual assistance program helps people affected by disasters who have uninsured or underinsured expenses. Public assistance from FEMA grants local governments money to recover from natural disasters. 
Beshear announced the decisions in a Wednesday afternoon press release. 
“While we appreciate the Individual Assistance and Public Assistance we were granted for most of the affected areas, we are disappointed in the decision,” Beshear said. “We are actively comparing the damage assessments, and we plan to appeal.”
FEMA sent Beshear a letter earlier this week about its decision that said the damage assessments of Christian and Todd counties for individual assistance and Leslie County for public assistance “is not of the severity and magnitude” to warrant those designations. 
Some Kentucky communities were approved for about $56 million in federal funding to repair damage from the May tornadoes and April floods last week. 
President Donald Trump previously approved direct federal aid for individuals in six counties hit by May tornadoes, storms and straight-line winds. Nineteen people died as a result of those storms.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2215237419-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 10:56:17.342783

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Only a dozen states have laws establishing suicide prevention offices or coordinators, and just 11 have task forces or committees dedicated to suicide prevention efforts, according to a new report.
The report comes amid sweeping cuts at federal agencies that offer mental health support. They include significant slashes in staffing and funding at the nation’s largest mental health and substance use agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to fold SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America.
Released last week, the report was conducted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials with support from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The analysis is part of an online resource breaking down details of suicide prevention efforts at the state level.
As of Jan. 1, just a dozen states had offices or state coordinators focused on suicide prevention: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Some states have these offices mandated by law and others were established through executive orders.
Eleven states (Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah and Washington) plus Puerto Rico have laws requiring a task force, commission or advisory group focused on suicide prevention.
The report notes prevention efforts are most effective when they are focused on higher-risk populations, areas, age groups and occupations. Suicide risk is higher among rural residents, older adults, American Indian and Alaska Native people, people with disabilities, veterans and groups that identify with a sexual minority. The federal administration recently pulled the plug on LGBTQ+ specialized supports under the national suicide hotline, 988.
About 60% of states — 29 states and Washington, D.C. — have laws that establish some form of fatality review committees that specifically include suicide deaths in reviews. Areas of focus varied among the states. Some had statewide teams and others were on the local level, according to the report.
The report notes that another 11 states assign prevention responsibilities within other offices. Minnesota law, for example, assigns such tasks to the state commissioner of health, rather than toward a special suicide prevention office or coordinator.
In 2023, the nation saw 49,000 deaths by suicide, according to the CDC. Firearms are involved in more than half of suicides.

The private membership association, called Return to the Land, owns 160 acres in northeast Arkansas, according to its website. Jews and non-whites are explicitly banned from membership.
The group’s leader recently said it is exploring the idea of expanding north and building a new enclave in the Springfield area.
“We have the God-given right to form communities according to whatever values we hold dear,” Eric Orwoll, co-founder of Return to the Land, said in a recent social media post, “and the government does not have the right to tell free American citizens what values they have to live according to in their own private lives.”
The idea of a segregated community coming to southwest Missouri was greeted with scorn by both Democratic and Republican legislative leaders from the area.
“Racism in any form is evil and reprehensible,” said House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican. “Groups engaging in racist conduct are not welcome in Springfield.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said history has been “very clear on what happens when you stay silent as groups discriminate based on race and discriminate based on whether or not someone is of the Jewish faith. I cannot believe that in 2025 we are retreading this ground.”
The Springfield City Council and City Manager David Cameron issued a joint statement this week declaring that “there is no place in Springfield, or anywhere, for such a divisive and discriminatory vision.”
“While it is improbable that such a project could legally or practically occur within city limits, silence is not an option,” the statement said. “As a regional leader, we will not stand idly by in the face of attempts to revive outdated, harmful ideologies.”
On its website, Return to the Land states its mission is to “separate ourselves from a failing modern society, and we will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities.”
It also includes a disclaimer that the group does not engage in the sale or rental of real estate.

Orwoll responded to criticism from Springfield elected officials in his social media post, denying that excluding people of color and Jews should be considered racist.
“We are not a hate group,” he said. “We have never expressed hate towards any ethnic group, racial group or religious group.”
He took umbrage with Fogle calling the group racist, saying: “She wants to call us racists because we prefer being among our own people.”
“It’s not a supremacist group. It’s not a hate group. It’s not even a white nationalist group,” he said. “We are white identitarians. We value our identity and want to preserve it. That’s not hate. That is love for your own people.”
Fogle, who was among the first public officials to condemn Return to the Land’s possible expansion to Missouri, said she has been inundated with “pretty horrific messages and pretty horrific responses” on social media.
But she said she has no intention of being silent.
“It’s my job to make sure I’m using my platform to communicate that there’s no place in Springfield, no place in Missouri, no place in this country for a group who is intentionally leaving behind people who have a different skin color or intentionally leaving behind people of the Jewish faith,” she said. “And I would expect every elected official at every level to use their platform to see the same things.”
Across the state line, the group also drew the ire of Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin.
The Republican announced his office would open an investigation of the group to ensure its activities didn’t violate state or federal law. That probe, Griffin said in an email to The Independent, has not turned up any illegal activity.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey did not respond to requests for comment.

Earlier this month, the Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC) approved a settlement in the water rate case of Tidewater Utilities, Inc. (“Tidewater”), finalizing a new rate structure that includes a 13% increase in customer water rates and a 5% increase in fixed monthly charges.
For the average residential customer, this will amount to an estimated $8 increase in monthly bills.
Tidewater initially filed its rate case on August 30, 2024, seeking a revenue increase of $10.3 million, equivalent to a 25.66% increase. It was the company’s first request to raise base water rates in a decade.
Following extensive negotiations, the final settlement reduced the rate increase to $5.5 million, significantly lowering the financial impact on customers. Fixed monthly charges for standard residential customers with 5/8” and 3/4” meters will increase modestly from $17.11 to $18.00 per month, rather than the originally proposed 13% hike.
RELATED STORY: What to know about PFAS in Delaware: local impacts, risks, and what’s being done
Customers within the Town of Ocean View will continue to pay their current fixed customer charge, as outlined in Commission Order No. 10656.
The settlement also requires Tidewater to refund $1.1 million in excess deferred income tax to customers. This credit, which includes interest, will be issued over a six-month period to help offset the impact of the rate increase.
“Any utility rate increase means tighter budgets for Delaware families,” said Jameson Tweedie, Delaware Public Advocate. “But this settlement reduces the increase by almost half, collectively saving Tidewater customers millions of dollars per year versus Tidewater’s application, requires Tidewater to refund to customers $1.1 million, and is the first Tidewater rate increase in a decade. As with any case, the staff of the Division of the Public Advocate worked hard to limit the impact to customers.”
The agreement was the result of extensive negotiations among Tidewater, the Division of the Public Advocate, and PSC staff, aimed at balancing competing interests.
Tidewater’s new rates took effect after July 3, 2025. However, the impact on customer bills will be somewhat mitigated due to the partial implementation of the increase through interim rates that took effect on October 30, 2024.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TUI_Water_Tank-1.jpg,,,2025-07-31 10:56:17.342783

DemasThis story was originally published by Ottawa News Network.
ALLENDALE — Grand Valley State University is extending a crucial lifeline to students from fellow Michigan college Siena Heights University.
With Siena Heights set to close its doors, GVSU is offering guaranteed admission and scholarship opportunities, aiming to ensure a seamless academic transition for those facing an unexpected disruption to their education. Sienna is located on Michigan’s southeast side in Adrian.
The decision by Siena Heights, a 105-year-old Catholic institution, to cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year was announced June 30. The move impacts approximately 1,855 enrolled students, creating an urgent need for clear pathways to continue their studies. The decision to close its doors came down to several factors, mainly financial, according to a statement on its website.
“Senior leadership has assessed the financial situation, operational challenges and long-term sustainability. Despite the dedication of our board, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and supporters, continuing operations beyond the coming academic year is no longer feasible,” the statement reads.
Grand Valley’s immediate response seeks to address the students’ placement head-on.
In a statement from B. Donta Truss, Grand Valley’s vice president for Enrollment Development and Educational Outreach, it’s clear the university is there to help.
“We understand the uncertainty and disruption this unfortunate situation creates for Siena Heights students,” the vice president said. “We want to assure them that their educational goals can remain within reach. Grand Valley is ready to help them continue their journey.”
 Comprehensive support for transition

GVSU has developed a multi-faceted approach to support transferring Siena Heights students. Beyond guaranteeing admission for those in good academic standing, the university has extended the deadline for its transfer merit scholarships to Aug. 22, providing valuable extra time for applicants to secure financial assistance, according to the university’s website.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/78F99839-AF86-42CD-B735-FF8C3AB4A590-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-31 09:57:16.009612

James Andrew McGann was taken into custody at 4:57 p.m. Wednesday and charged with two counts of capital murder, according to an ASP news release. He was booked into Washington County Jail as Andrew McGann around 7 p.m. Wednesday, according to jail intake records. 
Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, were fatally attacked while hiking with their daughters Saturday at the state park, located just south of Fayetteville. The girls, who are 7 and 9, were not injured and are safe with family members, according to the news release. 
During a late-night press conference Wednesday at Arkansas State Police Troop L Headquarters in Lowell, Stacie Rhoads, commander of ASP’s Criminal Investigation Division, confirmed that McGann recently moved to Northwest Arkansas and got a job working at a local school. 
Springdale Public Schools confirmed that McGann was hired as a teacher for the upcoming school year, but had not yet begun employment with the district, 40/29 News reported. Broken Arrow Public Schools in Oklahoma also confirmed to 40/29 News that McGann was a teacher in the district during the 2023-2024 school year. 
Rhoads said the public was “instrumental” in identifying the suspect, but refrained from discussing what led to his arrest as well as his motive, which she said is still being explored.  
“We still have a lot of work to do in terms of securing a conviction because that’s our next big focus right now, but we will release some details as they become available that we think are pertinent,” she said. “The community deserves to know what happened and what led to that arrest, and we’ll be happy to share that when the time is right.” 
Rhoads said the Brink family was notified of the arrest shortly after it occurred, and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked Arkansans to keep them in their prayers “because it’s a long road ahead and the grieving process has just begun.”
ASP Director Col. Mike Hagar said he was “extremely grateful for the long hours and dedication” law enforcement put forth in apprehending the suspect.
“The collaboration between state police and other local law enforcement agencies, our federal partners has been second to none,” Hagar said. “Because of their hard work and investigative skill, we were able to take a monster off the streets.”
Director of State Parks Shea Lewis said officials are going to take their time in reopening trails and other parts of Devil’s Den.
“Right now they’re going to remain closed. I want to make sure the Brink family has time to grieve, go through this process, time for our staff to assess the situation, and then we’ll reopen it at the appropriate time,” Lewis said.

Legislative leaders on Wednesday rolled out a take-it-or-leave-it proposal that some dissatisfied attorneys quickly slammed as insufficient.
The post Deal to raise bar advocate pay panned as ‘a slap in the face’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","TWO MONTHS after bar advocates stopped taking new cases to demand pay raises, legislative leaders on Wednesday rolled out a take-it-or-leave-it proposal that some dissatisfied attorneys quickly slammed as insufficient.
In one swoop, top lawmakers moved to present a potential solution to the crisis that has erupted in some courtrooms and to resolve a months-old spending bill that offers funding injections for rental aid, elder home care services and electronic benefit cards.
The bill (S 2575) will receive House and Senate votes Thursday, the last day before lawmakers plan to slow down for a traditional-but-not-mandatory August break.
One bar advocate at the center of the months-long fight criticized the measure, calling it a “slap in the face” and questioning whether it would succeed at bringing the private attorneys back to court for new cases.
The 40-page legislation also includes $60 million to fund home care services for older adults, nearly $43 million for the Residential Assistance for Families in Transition program, $28.9 million to cover settlements and judgments, and $15.5 million to help the Department of Transitional Assistance roll out electronic benefits transfer chip cards.
Legislative negotiators left several major spending ideas on the cutting-room floor during their talks. They dropped $134 million for the Medical Assistance Trust Fund that both branches originally approved and $209 million for fiscally strained hospitals and community health centers that the Senate pushed.
A House Ways and Means Committee spokesperson said the Healey administration asked the Legislature to wait until a forthcoming “closeout” supplemental budget to tackle the Medical Assistance Trust Fund. Senate budget chief Michael Rodrigues said he hopes to revive the hospital funding proposal “in the very near future.”
“We’re not there yet on the provisions, but we are committed, and we want to say so publicly, committed to get to a solution as soon as possible,” he said at a meeting the conference committee held to approve the agreement.
The compromise would also push the reporting deadline for a commission studying assisted living facilities from Aug. 1 to Dec. 31, 2025 — a nearly five-month extension that surpasses the 90 additional days members sought in order to incorporate lessons learned from the deadly Gabriel House fire in Fall River into their recommendations.
All six lawmakers on the conference committee signed the compromise, signaling their support. Lawmakers filed the accord with the Senate clerk’s office at 1:25 p.m. Wednesday, and newly reformed legislative rules bar either branch from taking it up until 24 hours later.

The underlying legislation (S 2540 / H 4265) did not feature any language dealing with bar advocate pay, but lawmakers were worried enough about the crisis to add something brand new to the spending bill during the conference committee process.
They landed on a proposal that would both increase pay for bar advocates, who are private attorneys contracted to represent defendants that cannot afford representation, and reshape their working relationship with the state.
Attorneys contracted to represent indigent clients would get raises of $20 per hour over two years, less than the single-year $35 per hour bump they sought. Lawmakers expect that to cost about $27 million per year, with money for the raises coming from the fiscal year 2026 annual budget and then the eventual fiscal year 2027 budget.
Today, bar advocates earn $65 per hour for their work in District Court, $85 for most Appeals and Superior Court work, and up to $120 per hour on murder cases. They contend those rates are the lowest in New England, and argue that most other neighboring states pay at least $100 per hour at a base level.
“This is a 30 percent increase over a two-year period in a very difficult fiscal time period that we’re in,” House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz said. “Most of the folks working for state government are not getting 30 percent increases over the next two years, so we are hopeful that they will accept it.”
While speaking with reporters later in the day, Senate President Karen Spilka added, “Who else is getting a 30 percent salary increase at this time? Your face tells it all. I mean, 30 percent salary increase, and the reason we’re doing it is because we believe, the Senate and the House believe, access to justice is so important. They went out on a work stoppage without really talking to us.”
The bill would require bar advocates to sign a biannual contract with the Committee for Public Counsel Services detailing minimum coverage requirements. If the attorneys once again bonded together and agreed not to take new assignments unless they receive a pay raise, that would constitute an antitrust law violation under the new legislation.
Michlewitz said that provision will “hopefully prevent any future issues that we had similar to what we’ve had over the last couple of weeks.”
Lawmakers also proposed a $40 million injection for CPCS, which would allow the organization to hire about 320 additional public defenders.
“Massachusetts is an outlier in relying on private [lawyers] to handle 80 percent of the cases of indigent cases. That’s unlike anywhere else in the country,” Rodrigues said. “So we now are making significant investments to more than double the number of public defenders in order to alleviate the need for as many bar advocates as we’ve had.”
In a statement, House Speaker Ron Mariano said the bill “takes steps to ensure that the Commonwealth will no longer be over-reliant on the bar advocates.”
“The right to legal representation is a crucial element of the Constitutional guarantee to a fair trial, which is why I urge the bar advocates to return to work so that they can resume upholding that right and put an end to this public safety crisis,” he said.
Jennifer O’Brien, a veteran bar advocate who has been a major figure in the issue, said Wednesday that the proposal lawmakers rolled out “doesn’t go far enough.”
“It’s very disappointing. They really obviously haven’t heard us,” O’Brien said. “To me, it just looks like they’re doing everything to retaliate against us or not fund the program — everything they can do except for solve the crisis, which is just to pay the market rate, which is what other states have been doing.”
The labor action by bar advocates, who work as independent contractors, has been somewhat informally organized. O’Brien said she is on a listserv with more than 500 “like-minded” attorneys frustrated by their pay for public defense work.
For many, she said, “the consensus is that this is a slap in the face.”
“I don’t know that this proposal is going to get current bar advocates that are not taking cases to run back to court, or incentivize the attorneys who have already been taking cases to take more cases,” O’Brien said.
Many bar advocates stopped taking new cases in late May to protest their pay after what they describe as several months of outreach to lawmakers. Amid constitutional concerns, the decision prompted some courts to begin releasing defendants or dismissing cases.
Beacon Hill grew increasingly frustrated with the labor action in recent weeks, calling on bar advocates to resume accepting assignments before a final resolution and suggesting elected officials were surprised by the demands.
One reporter asked Michlewitz if the bill was “basically a take-it-or-leave-it deal.”
“Yeah, at this point,” he replied. “We think we’ve done something that is significant, sufficient, [and] is [a] much higher [raise] than anybody else in state government’s really seeing right now.”
Some bar advocates have said top Democrats ignored their calls or declined meetings. O’Brien and fellow bar advocate Sean Delaney met earlier Wednesday, before lawmakers announced their proposal, with Senate Republicans.
“This has been a situation that’s been festering for a while,” Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr told reporters after that meeting. “It’s not a secret that for many years, bar advocates in Massachusetts have not been paid at the same rates that their colleagues in the New England states, and by extension, even across the country, are being paid. So this is not a secret.”
Sen. Minority Leader Bruce Tarr speaks with reporters in his office on July 30, 2025.Ella Adams / SHNS
Michlewitz on Wednesday said there had been a “communication breakdown between the bar advocates, CPCS and the Legislature.”
“These last couple weeks exposed that, I think, for both of us. We were not ready to hear that it was at this boiling point that it was after both of our budgets had passed,” he said.
The Senate added language to its annual budget proposal that would have increased annual pay for bar advocates by $5 to $10 per hour, but the final accord that emerged from private House-Senate talks made no such change.
Asked why negotiators dropped that provision, Rodrigues said it “came to us very quickly.”
“It came to us at a very late hour. After we passed that version adopted in the Senate budget, that’s when actions were taken by the private bar advocates that said that was not adequate,” he said. “So we decided to punt it, to hold it on that, and to deal with it in this vehicle so we could have real conversations with our friends at CPCS, with the private bar advocates that were actually working in constitutionally protecting indigent defendants. And I think we’ve come to a very good resolution.”
Before lawmakers announced the deal, Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday described the situation as “a matter of public safety.”
Asked how damaging it would be for hundreds of cases to be dismissed, she replied, “Look, it’s all the more reason why there needs to be a resolution. Because, you know, for the sake of defendants who are entitled to due process, for the sake of victims, who need to have their cases heard. I mean, for our whole system of justice, we need folks back at work, and we need the wheels of justice to start moving again.”

The corollary, though, is that anyone who has a near-monopoly on knowledge will have enormous power to shape public perception. That enormous power brings enormous potential for abuse.
Child welfare systems tend to be more secretive than the CIA. So whoever becomes a state’s ombudsman or child advocate often has enormous power. But while such offices are conceived as a way to watch over state child welfare agencies, lawmakers tend to forget a crucial question: Who watches the watchdog?
So instead of simply further boosting the power of the Maine Child Welfare Ombudsman, which was among the oversight reforms proposed last legislative session, lawmakers need to restructure the office.
Perhaps the only thing about Maine’s child welfare system that everyone seems to agree on is that caseworkers are overwhelmed and underprepared, rushing from case to case. Under those conditions, it should be obvious that there will be terrible mistakes in all directions. An office that finds errors only one way, concluding that workers routinely leave children in dangerous homes and never take a child needlessly – or vice versa – probably has a structural problem. 
That’s all the more true in a state like Maine, which takes children away from their families at a rate more than double the national average — even when rates of child poverty are factored in. A state where foster care numbers have skyrocketed at the fastest rate in the nation, even as they have declined nationally.
But Maine’s child welfare watchdog isn’t built to detect errors in all directions because it only investigates when someone calls in a complaint — and even then, only when the office itself decides the complaint is worthy of investigation.
That builds in potential for unintended bias.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For starters, some people are more likely to know about the watchdog and better able to frame a formal complaint. Then there’s the criteria for selection. In Maine, according to the ombudsman’s annual report, those criteria include “the demeanor and credibility of the caller.” Suppose your child was just torn from your arms and you were desperate for help. What would your “demeanor” be like?
But even if you could establish objective criteria for accepting complaints, relying solely on complaints also builds in bias. 
Maine’s office should also be required to perform an annual audit of a random sample of cases to assess system performance and make recommendations.
The audits should be conducted by a diverse team of stakeholders — former family defense attorneys and prosecutors, for example. At my organization’s suggestion, New Jersey’s first child advocate, pioneered a similar approach 19 years ago, producing a report that found — no surprise — errors in all directions.  
A similar approach is essential for choosing the leadership of the office. Any such office needs a Board of Directors that is not only diverse in terms of race and ethnicity, but also in terms of lived experience and viewpoints. The board should include current and/or former foster youth, foster parents, kinship foster parents, birth parents who lost children to the system, current or former frontline caseworkers, prosecutors and family defense attorneys.
But it can’t stop there. Mental health and domestic violence are constantly cited as reasons for child welfare intervention. So the board needs mental health practitioners, people who work with survivors of domestic violence, and survivors themselves.  
In addition, in Maine, as in most states, the system focuses almost exclusively on poor people. Far more children are taken away because of housing issues than for physical and sexual abuse combined. So the board should also include leaders of anti-poverty organizations. 
More than one-quarter of Hispanic children in Maine will be forced into foster care at some point during their childhoods. And, according to a study of federal data from 2015-2019, 15% of Hispanic families in Maine are likely to have their children torn from them forever — the highest rate in the nation. Maine also has a longstanding record of disproportionate removal of Native families. So the board should include representatives from local tribes and civil rights organizations. 
Then, after what would, no doubt, be vigorous debate, this group should choose the ombudsman.
But a restructured office isn’t enough. The near-monopoly on information needs to be broken.  For starters, there should be a strong presumption in law that all child welfare court hearings are open to the press and public, unless attorneys for children or parents could provide good reason to close all or part of a hearing. More than 40% of foster children live in states where this is standard practice. Critics’ concerns about violating children’s privacy have not materialized and it’s led to modest systemic improvement.
Ultimately, when children’s lives are at stake, we all need to be watchdogs.

Derrik C. Hoitsma, Jr. (aka Derrik Jordan), 70, died peacefully at home, with his family present, from kidney failure on July 12, 2025. Derrik was an award-winning singer-songwriter, record producer, composer, and multi-instrumentalist known for playing electric violin (notably a 5-string), guitar, piano, percussion, kalimba, and ngoni. His song, “Speak Through Me,” from Expecting a Miracle, earned first place in the Gospel-Inspirational category (out of 32,000 entries) and second place overall in the 2004 USA Songwriting Competition. His reggae-influenced track. “Something’s Gonna Change” won Reggae Song of the Year in 2002 from Just Plain Folks. He was also the creator, host, and producer of 171 episodes of “The World Fusion Show,” a public-access TV series and podcast based in Brattleboro in which he interviewed and jammed with musicians from all over the world on different instruments. The show won Best Entertainment & Arts Series (2019) for public-access TV. It airs biweekly across 100 stations in 26 states, and is heard in over 50 countries. Born on an Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas, in 1955, Derrik grew up in Short Hills, New Jersey, with his parents, Joan and Derrik Hoitsma Sr. Joan remarried to Michael Bowman. Siblings are Jim Hoitsma, Lisa Hoitsma, Tom Hoitsma, Michael Bowman (now deceased) and Jonathan Bowman. Siblings Erica and Greg Hoitsma grew up in Remsenburg, New York, with Derrik Hoitsma Sr., who died in 2010. Derrik attended Milburn (N.J.) High School and then Bennington College, where he studied music composition with Henry Brant and Vivian Fine, and percussion with master drummer Milford Graves. After graduating from Bennington, Derrik lived briefly in New York where he met recording artist Angela Bofil who recorded his song, “Share Your Love.” Derrik moved to Brattleboro in 1981. He commuted to New York for 10 years to collaborate with Lisa Sokolov, Lorraine Ferro, Last Poets founding director Abiodun Oyewole, Tantra Zawadi, Stephanie Lewis, Ann Curliss, Larry Collins, Jimmy Brelauer, Alvin Mack, Tommy Bailen, Eric Lawrence, and others. Derrik auditioned for jingles with his friend Sherman Foote, and was first runner-up for the lead vocal in the 1984 Olympics jingle for Snickers. He won the male lead in WNBC-TV’s promotional campaign in 1983, “We’re 4 New York.” Derrik played in a succession of local bands, including the Stockwell Brothers, Cayenne, Spunk, and Simba, to which he contributed his original music. Derrik led the samba band called Samba Joy that marched in the Fourth of July parades in Brattleboro and Saxtons River. He also played in local wedding bands with Brian Bender and Al Alyessi. Derrik collaborated with many local musicians including Eugene Uman, Tony Vacca, Moonlight Davis, and Morning Star Chenven, Steve Leicash, Eugene Freisen, Gary Rosen, Jared Shapiro, Barry Hyman, Doug Morton, Doug Raneiri, and others. Derrik received a commission to write Odzihozo and the Lake, inspired by an Abenaki legend about the creation of Lake Champlain. The piece was performed by the Windham Symphony Orchestra with Hugh Keelan in 2006 as well as in numerous venues throughout the state. He also had a work commissioned and performed by the Sage City Symphony, and the Windham Orchestra commissioned and performed Windham Loops that featured the Impulse Ensemble: Derrik, Tony Vaca, and Jim Matus. A longtime artist on Worldsoul Records in Putney, he released several CDs, including Brazilliance – Everyone Loves Brazil, a double album featuring original sambas and bossa novas; Expecting a Miracle, co-produced with Tom “T-Bone” Wolk; Touch the Earth, a world-music, eco-themed concept album; and five solo SuperString Theory albums showcasing his electric violin in world-fusion contexts. More of his music can be found at derrikjordan.com. His musical style spanned Brazilian (samba, bossa nova), reggae, Afropop, salsa, funk, jazz, and world fusion. Derrik is survived by his wife, Marjorie Pivar; his sons Jasper Hoitsma and Jovi Federici; his daughter, Sheyna Hoitsma; his mother, Joan; and siblings Jim, Tom, Lisa, Jonathan, Erica, and Greg. Memorial information: None provided at this time.

“There is just no way to subsidize housing development processes enough” to be affordable to the lowest income residents, said Matt Noyes of CHAPA, “without affordable rental assistance."" 
The post Trump policies offer mixed messages on affordable housing  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE LARGEST FEDERAL program subsidizing affordable housing construction got a major boost in the Trump administration’s new tax bill, a bipartisan win that drew cheers from affordable housing advocates and developers alike. But Massachusetts housing advocates decried what they said is a split-brain approach from the administration, as expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit came alongside Trump’s proposal to reduce funding for rental assistance programs like Section 8, which help cover housing costs for low-income tenants.  
It’s difficult logic to square, said Matt Noyes, director of state and federal advocacy for the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association. “The two sides are not rowing in the same direction, to say the least,” Noyes said of the dual policy moves.   
Noyes said affordable housing depends on favorable zoning, “capital dollars to have shovels going in [the ground] and building frames going up, and operating dollars for rental assistance programs.” He said Trump is leaving the last part by the wayside.  
“There is just no way to subsidize housing development processes enough” to be affordable to the lowest income residents, he said, “without affordable rental assistance.” 
The tax incentive gives investors a stream of tax credits in exchange for providing funds for low-income housing projects, which can be for-profit or nonprofit developments. The projects must include a certain proportion of low-income housing units, preserved for at least three decades.  
Signed into law by President Trump on July 4, the federal tax bill provides the largest permanent increase to the 1986 tax program in decades. Beginning in 2026, annual tax credit allocations will increase by 12 percent, and the threshold for using tax-exempt bonds to finance projects has been lowered from 50 percent to 25 percent.   
Supporters tout the tax credit as a way to incentivize investment, generate jobs and tax revenue, and support working families, veterans, and seniors with stable housing at below-market rents. The Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition, a national group that supports tax credits as a way to unlock affordable housing, estimates that these changes could result in financing for 1.22 million new affordable rental homes over the next decade.  
The program is “such an important tool that it’s hard to overstate,” Noyes said. “Constructing homes has only gotten more expensive in recent years, and this is a critical tool to build the housing we need.”  
But equally critical, say housing advocates, are programs that help low-income renters bridge the gap between what they earn and the cost of housing.  
“The rental assistance is such a core part of the system and serves so many people,” said Clark Ziegler, executive director of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, which strongly supports both the tax credit expansion and protecting rental assistance programs. “If that is compromised or in jeopardy,” he said, “that’s very concerning.” 
In few places is that as true as in Massachusetts. To afford market-level rent and utilities for a two-bedroom apartment in the state, without paying more than 30 percent of income on housing, a household must have annual income of $95,476, according to an analysis from the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Massachusetts is the fourth most expensive US state or territory based on this metric.  
Investments in new housing supply and direct rental assistance to tenants have traditionally been considered complementary approaches. Housing built with the tax credits primarily serves renters earning at or below 50 to 60 percent of area median income, which includes many struggling households but can exclude those with the lowest incomes who are typical recipients of rental assistance vouchers.  
“While it is an important resource,” the low-income housing tax credit “on its own, rarely builds or preserves homes affordable to households with the lowest incomes, those with the greatest and clearest needs,” the National Low Income Housing Coalition wrote in a pitch for reforms to the program last year.   
The tax credit changes had bipartisan support from the start – an usual feature in Trump-era policy – with years of support for expanding the tax incentive from lawmakers of both parties as well as more recently from the developer president himself.   
Trump’s support is “not a surprise,” said Ziegler. “This is a tax-credit-reform-happy administration that strongly prefers tax legislation to spending. That all fits and makes sense.”  
But the rental assistance that advocates say is also vital to affordable housing is in a precarious situation. Administration officials and some congressional leaders have advanced proposals to decrease funding for programs like the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8), which provide direct assistance to low-income households, or limit the length of time a household can use federal rental assistance.  
The cuts are being justified on the basis of cost savings or administrative efficiency. The administration’s 2026 budget proposal says the spending plan “empowers states by transforming the current federal dysfunctional rental assistance programs into a state-based formula grant which would allow states to design their own rental assistance programs based on their unique needs and preferences.”  
Noyes said organizations like the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association are not seeing the number of rental vouchers being reduced yet, but he and Zeigler worried about fewer vouchers in the market if cuts come or usage atrophies because of loss of faith in the federal program.   
Massachusetts, Noyes said, is fortunate to have its own state-based rental voucher program, serving about 10,700 households. A recent report from the MassINC Polling Group found the program is well-regarded, though it could use some administrative improvements.  
For now, the president’s desire to hand rental assistance obligations over to the states – by combining five major federal housing assistance programs run by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development into state block grants – has run into a roadblock in the Republican-controlled Congress.    
House and Senate appropriations committees preserved the structure of rental assistance programs in their HUD budgets. Republican committee chairs also expressed concern about the implementation and effectiveness of the HUD changes.  
“While there is a long way to go before the fiscal 2026 budget is adopted, there is reason for some optimism,” wrote Deborah VanAmerongen, strategic policy advisor in Boston-based Nixon Peabody’s affordable housing practice group. In her assessment, the current structure of each program may be preserved and funded.  
Zeigler, who says the administration’s approach to housing affordability is “not coherent,” agrees. “The House and Senate have been appropriating funds above and beyond what the president proposed,” he said. “It is not, to this point, rubber stamping of what the administration has proposed. It turns out it’s harder to let go of those safety net programs than people may have thought.”

Donny Olson, D-Golovin, is seen in his office within the Alaska Capitol on May 20, 2025. (James Brooks photo/Alaska Beacon)On the last day of Alaska’s legislative session in May, Sen. Donny Olson made a mistake.
The longtime Democratic senator from Golovin, mishearing Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, voted to sustain Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill that increases the state’s public school education formula. 
Heads snapped to Olson, and his colleague, Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, elbowed him.
When Senate President Gary Stevens asked if any lawmakers wanted to change their votes. Olson stood, and without speaking, pointed at the voting board.
Stevens duly changed Olson’s vote, and for the first time in over two decades, the Legislature overrode a veto by a sitting governor.
Olson’s silent statement was emblematic of his session.

Since suffering a stroke-like medical emergency in January, Olson has been suffering from aphasia, a language disorder that has made it difficult for him to translate his thoughts into spoken words.
Now, he’s about to return to the Capitol for a special session called by Dunleavy. Again, education issues are on the calendar, and again, Olson will be asked to cast his vote.
Olson sat down for an interview on May 20, shortly after the Alaska Senate adjourned its regular session for the year. Since then, in a series of interviews, colleagues and those familiar with his work have described a man healing from a severe health condition but one still able to serve in the Legislature.
Olson isn’t up for election until 2028. Barring early retirement, he will become the most senior legislator in 2027, as several of his colleagues leave office.
“The thinking is still the same. The articulation, that’s what, uh, is,” Olson said, struggling to finish the sentence.
Can he still do his job as a senator?
He nodded. 
Olson has an extensive career — he’s been a doctor, a reindeer herder, a commercial pilot, and earned a law degree. He graduated from the University of Minnesota-Duluth with a bachelor’s in chemistry before getting a medical degree from Oral Roberts University and, later, graduating from the University of Colorado School of Law.
As challenging as each of those degrees has been — plus family life and his legislative career — recovering from his stroke-like illness may be the toughest obstacle yet.
“It’s still pretty fresh. It’s like a tailspin,” he said.
“You know your feelings, but you can’t quite articulate what your feelings are,” he said.
When Olson left the Capitol in January, several of his colleagues weren’t sure whether he would be able to return. In private discussions, they debated who might fill his seat if he were to resign.
“I did hear a rumor that I am retiring,” he said by text message on July 10. “That is not true.”
Olson was absent from the Capitol for nearly a month and underwent an intensive language therapy program at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago.
“My time in Chicago was incredibly beneficial, and I am grateful for the therapy I received. While I will continue participating in speech therapy as part of my recovery, I am feeling strong and energized to be back at work,” he said in a written statement on March 10, after returning to the Capitol.
He’s continued to undergo speech therapy here in Alaska.
Does he feel like things are improving?
“Oh, for sure. With the month down in intensive (therapy) in Chicago … when I was talking to the stroke people, (U.S. Sen. John Fetterman), the senator from Pennsylvania, I think he was a lot farther down than I am,” Olson said.
Fetterman suffered a stroke in 2022 while running for office and was hospitalized for weeks with depression after being sworn into the U.S. Senate. Afterward, he relied on transcription services and other technological tools to do his job.
In May, not long before Olson ended the Alaska Legislature’s regular session, New York Magazine published a lengthy examination of the way that Fetterman’s personality seemed to have changed since the stroke. 
Olson’s colleagues say they’ve seen nothing like that from Olson.
“I think he’s got the same sense of humor. He’s got the same — I think he’s got the same cognitive ability. I think it’s just his ability to speak, but even that has improved,” said Rep. Robyn Burke, D-Utqiagvik and one of the two state representatives in Olson’s state Senate district.
Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, is the other and could not be reached for comment.
Since his illness, Olson has continued to meet with constituents, lobbyists and local government officials, who said they haven’t had problems communicating with him, even if he can’t speak clearly.
In a pair of interviews with the Nome Nugget — one in April and another after the end of the legislative session — Olson was able to make his positions clear through written responses. When speaking, his staff frequently finished his sentences.
Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, has worked as a registered nurse and an advanced nurse practitioner and is familiar with stroke-like symptoms.
She said she hasn’t observed any personality changes. Other lawmakers said the same. 
Olson said he’s not 100%, but he is getting better.
“I’m still on the road to recovery … what’s important are the milestones,” Olson said in May.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, said on Wednesday that he spoke with Olson a few days ago.
“He sounded a lot better,” Wielechowski said. 
“It was a short conversation; he called me, and he sounded much better than he was. … There was definite progress there,” he said.
Burke is supportive.
“I think he’s still there. I think his speech will continue to improve and come back stronger,” she said, “and he’ll be here. He’ll be here for years to come.”

But now, Rhodes is a candidate for Congress in 2026, saying he wants continue the work he has done in Iowa and support President Trump’s agenda by serving as the 4th District representative.
Rhodes announced his campaign earlier in July, saying he is running because the 4th District race “isn’t about left versus right—it’s about two very different visions for the future of conservatism.” His campaign slogan is “Make America Iowa,” saying he wants to bring GOP Iowans’ values to Congress.
Iowa’s 4th Congressional District has historically been a conservative stronghold that has been represented by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra since his victory against former U.S. Rep. Steve King in the 2020 primary election. But heading into 2026, Feenstra has launched an “exploratory committee” considering a run for Iowa governor,  meaning the congressional race likely will be an open contest.

Several Republicans have entered the primary race, including Iowa House Minority Leader Matt Windschitl, Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan and Kyle Larsen, a farmer and land appraiser. But in an interview Wednesday, Rhodes said he believed he was the best candidate for the job as someone with both a “deep network” in Iowa politics and as a person who has embodied many of the conservative values he said Iowans in the district share.
Alongside founding the Iowa Tea Party, he worked on Carson’s and Minnesota U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann’s caucus campaigns. He also worked with the Trump administration during his first term in office.
“(I’ve) stood the test of time in over 15 years plus, been fighting those battles, from the Tea Party to now to deciding to run for Congress,” Rhodes said. “And the administration also is going to need more stronger voices to get parts of the agenda done, especially to help cut the budget and to fight back against a lot of what’s going on.”
The federal funding cuts made through the U.S. DOGE service, formerly headed by Elon Musk, as well as through measures like the budget reconciliation bill are the type of government spending decisions he has supported for years through the Tea Party and conservative organizing for candidates, Rhodes said.
“It’s almost like the Tea Party joined MAGA,” Rhodes said.
In addition to supporting cutting federal spending, he said he supports defending gun rights through the Second Amendment, preventing transgender women from competing in women’s sports and supporting Iowa’s agriculture economy through measures like the “Save our Bacon” act, introduced by Iowa’s all-Republican delegation, that would nullify a California animal welfare law.
He also said he supports more stringent immigration policies, pointing to immigrant mayoral candidates Omar Fateh, the Minnesota state senator running to become mayor of Minneapolis, and Zohran Mamdani, the New York state representative running for New York City mayor. Fateh is the child of Somali immigrants born in Washington, D.C., and Mamdani is an Indian American born in Uganda; both identify as democratic socialists.
“We’ve brought in a lot of people who don’t share the same values as we do, like Omar Fateh or Mamdani,” Rhodes said. “I don’t believe that our country can survive that onslaught of opposing values here, and I think Iowa is a place to be able to … defend those values as well.”
In addition to working in politics, Rhodes said he has also worked in agriculture in addition to having served as CEO of Parler, a conservative social media platform, before stepping down earlier in 2025.
“I’ve done a lot of work in a lot of different areas, so I have a broad depth of understanding of issues and and a lot of what’s going on right now,” Rhodes said.

(File photo by Abraham Kenmore/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Whether South Carolina high school students have a constitutional right to take an advanced course on Black history was the central question in federal court Wednesday.
It was the first hearing on a lawsuit filed in January on behalf of students, educators, an author and the state NAACP that challenges a state law banning eight concepts from classroom lessons. The list of what can’t be taught includes that any race is inherently superior or automatically racist, that anyone is responsible for past atrocities because of their race, that someone’s worth is determined by race, and that traits such as hard work are oppressive and racist.
The concepts have been banned since 2021, when legislators inserted a directive titled “partisanship curriculum” into the state budget. While technically a one-year law, the clause has carried over to every budget since.
Education department officials pointed to the law last summer as among the reasons African American Studies wasn’t included on the state’s roster of Advanced Placement courses for the 2024-25 school year — the course’s inaugural year following a two-year pilot.
The lawsuit doesn’t directly challenge the omission of AP African American Studies, but the class was central to attorneys’ arguments.
NAACP attorney Charles McLaurin asked U.S. District Judge Sherri Lydon to strike the clause from the state budget while the lawsuit plays out. Education department attorney Miles Coleman asked Lydon to dismiss the case entirely, arguing students’ rights aren’t being violated.
Lydon made no decision Wednesday. She said she would decide as soon as possible whether to let the case continue and, if she does, whether to temporarily strike the budget clause.
AP African American Studies
McLaurin argued the state’s decision discriminated against Black students by removing a course showcasing their history.
Attorneys for the state noted some schools still offer an honors course in African American history, and students can still take the end-of-course AP exam to potentially earn college credit.
“There is nothing preventing districts from continuing to offer AP African American Studies as a locally-approved honors course should they choose to do so, in addition to continuing to offer other approved African American courses as districts have already done for a number of years,” reads a June 2024 memo written by Matthew Ferguson, then a deputy state superintendent, to local superintendents.
For students, the differences include dollars and GPA weightings.
The state doesn’t cover AP tests’ $98 cost for courses not on the Department of Education’s roster, meaning either students or their district must pay if they want to pursue college credit. And AP is a step above honors courses in GPA weightings, which matters for students competing for class rank and scholarships.
SC law causes bans on lessons, books about Black history, lawsuit claims

While AP African American Studies was open to any student in the pilot schools that offered it, the course was especially popular among Black students, NAACP attorney Maia Cole said. Because the classes focused on Black history, removing that option was a form of discrimination against Black students, she said.
In 2022-23, the first year the College Board tested its new AP course, one high school in South Carolina was picked for the pilot. As part of the pilot’s national expansion in 2023-24, 244 students in South Carolina took the AP African American Studies test.
Not giving that option to students statewide once the College Board officially launched the course for 2024-25 violated students’ due process and equal protection rights in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, according to the lawsuit.
But students don’t necessarily have a constitutional right to learn about specific topics in schools, Coleman said.
Lydon seemed to agree. For instance, if a school decided not to teach students about Martin Luther King, Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech, that would be within the school’s rights, she said.
“That’s a knuckleheaded idea,” Lydon said. “It’s not smart. But they can do it.”
Coleman called the honors course an acceptable alternative for interested students. But McLaurin said the two are “dramatically different,” arguing the AP version is “far more in-depth and far more interdisciplinary.”
Some students also don’t have access to the honors course, which isn’t offered in every district, McLaurin said.
Not all AP courses on the state’s roster are available in every district either. Since 1984, state law has required high schools to offer the college-level courses, which can provide college credit for students who pass the end-of-course test. But which courses are available differs by high school, largely depending on the school’s population and number of teachers. Ten are available online through the state’s Virtual SC program, aimed at providing the opportunity for students in schools where those aren’t offered.
Since the state’s decision on AP African American Studies applied to all students, no single group lost out more than others, Coleman argued.
How much of a role the law actually played in that decision remains unclear, attorneys said.
Other factors, including a scheduled review of the state’s social studies standards, were also part of the considerations last year, Coleman said. He noted President Donald Trump’s executive order in January with similar requirements could affect decisions going forward.
Lydon said striking the budget clause wouldn’t guarantee students the right to enroll in the class.
If she instructed the education department to offer the course code again, school districts would not be obliged to offer the class, and some may decide to wait until the social studies review is complete anyway, she said.
To attorneys on both sides, Lydon asked what the limits might look like: Could schools remove any class with a semblance of controversy around it? Could students indefinitely sue their districts to add whatever classes they wanted to take?
For instance, the same June 2024 memo explaining the state’s decision on AP African American Studies noted the AP pre-calculus course didn’t make the state list either.
Lydon questioned whether siding with the NAACP’s arguments meant she might have to later rule that schools must offer AP pre-calculus as well.
“I may have a lot of cases before me,” Lydon said. “Forever and ever, am I going to have to approve the department’s decisions on social studies?”
Other alleged impacts
The lawsuit also claimed the budget clause led to the removal of books from lesson plans and school libraries.
Specifically, “Between the World and Me,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, was removed from a teacher’s curriculum in the Lexington-Richland 5 School District in 2023, and “Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You,” by Ibram X. Kendi, was removed from school libraries across the state, the lawsuit claimed.
Coleman argued Kendi, who is named as a plaintiff, had no constitutional right guaranteeing all of his books would be available in public school libraries. A review board cited factual errors as the reason to remove “Stamped,” while allowing other books by Kendi to stay, Coleman said.
Kendi didn’t lose out on money or have his reputation damaged because his book was no longer offered in the libraries, McLaurin said. Instead, his argument was based entirely on his First Amendment right to not have his books removed because of the viewpoint expressed in them, McLaurin said.
Teacher Mary Wood, one of the plaintiffs in the case, faced no real repercussions from the district after being asked to remove “Between the World and Me” from her curriculum, said Edward Bradley, an attorney representing the school district where she teaches. The district has renewed her contract every year since, and while she sat down with administrators to review her lesson plan, she has not faced any formal disciplinary action, he said.
The harm to Wood is primarily to her credibility as a teacher, McLaurin said. The debacle undermined her professional standing to colleagues, students and teachers, and she faced anxiety and fear over whether she might lose her job for breaking state law, he said.
The clause is too vague to actually enforce, McLaurin said.
Of the eight banned concepts, the one cited as the most troublesome says lessons can’t make anyone “feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race or sex.”
Teachers don’t know what lessons may get them in trouble based on students’ feelings, McLaurin said.
Legislators of both parties agreed that line in the budget clause could stifle instruction.
That’s why it was purposefully excluded from legislation that sought to clean up the law while creating a uniform complaint process.
As passed by the Senate in May 2023, the bill specifically protected “historically accurate” discussions on slavery, Reconstruction, the Jim Crow era, segregation, racial lynchings, and any “historical oppression of a particular group of people based on race, sex, ethnicity, class, nationality, religion, or geographic region.”
If the measure has passed, it would have superseded the budget clause.
But opponents argued it would create fear among teachers about what they could teach, censor lessons, and discriminate. They succeeded in killing the bill, many perhaps not realizing that what they opposed was already state law through the budget, which would remain in place without the clarifications.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_8172-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-31 09:57:16.009612

As the federal administration carries out what it says is the largest deportation effort in the country’s history, immigrants already struggling to make rent are facing greater housing challenges that experts say undermine the state’s tenant protection laws, write CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and Ben Christopher.
In addition to including immigrants with no criminal background, green-card holders and U.S. citizens into its dragnet, President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration is detaining immigrants who are the sole source of income and rent for households. 
Not only does this place families at risk for living on the streets, it also has a chilling effect that discourages immigrants from exercising their rights against unlawful or unfair housing practices.
In Los Angeles, a Latino family sued their landlord and a real estate agent over an illegal eviction. As the case was unfolding, an attorney for the agent sent an email to the family’s lawyer suggesting that their clients were likely to be “picked up by ICE and deported.” Meanwhile, an Oakland landlord asked renters if they were “legal” in an attempt to push them out of their rental home.
California has some of the most expensive rents in the country. Undocumented immigrant renters often work low-paying jobs, have less access to public benefits and are more likely to spend most of their income on rent. They’re also more likely to live in overcrowded housing leased by friends or family members, which leave them vulnerable to poor living conditions.
But the threat of deportation keeps these tenants from speaking up, such as asking their landlords for a repair or a routine accommodation. Some are also too afraid to appear in court for housing-related issues, even when a landlord’s allegations are insufficient, said Patrick McDonell, a housing attorney with Sonoma County Legal Aid.

McDonell: “That person nevertheless is going to have to move out, just because we know that we don’t have a client who we’re going to be able to take to court.”

After months of speculation, former Vice President Kamala Harris confirmed Wednesday that she will not be running for California governor, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.

Harris, on social media: “I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.”

Since losing the presidential election in November, rumors ran rampant about Harris eyeing a bid for the state’s top official as her next possible career move. Born in Oakland, she served as the state’s attorney general in 2010 and later as a U.S. senator.
If she did run, Harris would have joined a crowded 2026 race that so far includes former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Senate leader Toni Atkins and others.

Appeals court upholds fee despite SCOTUS ruling

From CalMatters housing reporter Ben Christopher:
A panel of California appellate judges just pumped the brakes on what could have been a revolution in municipal budgeting and building fees across California.
The skirmish dates back to 2016 when George Sheetz, proposing to build a house on his property, sued El Dorado County over a $23,420 traffic mitigation fee.
Sheetz argued that the county needed to prove that the fee matched the financial toll his new home would actually leave on local roads. 
The case made its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, which sided unanimously with Sheetz — at least in principle. The court ruled that local governments, including county boards of supervisors, need to justify their impact fees. But it stopped short of saying how detailed they need to be. 
In a Tuesday ruling, three California judges took up that question and ruled that the county’s fee still passed muster under the high court’s more exacting standard.
Brian Hodges, attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which represented Sheetz, said they were still deciding whether to appeal.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Secretary of State Scott Schwab said after a White House visit that federal officials should authorize use of Social Security and immigration information to assist state and local election administrators with updating of voter registration lists.
Schwab, a candidate for the Kansas Republican Party’s nomination for governor in 2026, said the goal was to combine the Social Security Administration’s death index with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data to identify people who were deceased or noncitizens and not eligible to vote.
“No previous administration has taken the initiative to bring this tool to the states,” Schwab said.
He said a visit by state election officials at the White House included a commitment from the administration of President Donald Trump to improve election security information sharing among federal and state officials.
Since losing the 2000 presidential election, Trump has claimed without evidence that President Joe Biden prevailed due to voting irregularities.
“This is not a partisan issue,” Schwab said in a statement Wednesday. “Every state should care about the integrity of their voter rolls and should want the most accurate, up-to-date data available to do so.”
Schwab, who serves as Kansas’ top election official, said he had previously advocated for states to have greater access to federal data useful to making voter registration rolls more accurate. He said the Biden administration didn’t show a willingness to share information.
The White House gathering with secretaries of state was one of the first times state officials were formally invited to discuss federal data sharing, he said.
“It is refreshing to receive such a prompt and collaborative response from this administration,” Schwab said. He said the approach of the Trump administration was vital to maintaining voter confidence in the election system.
Schwab has said many times that Kansas elections were fair and accurate. He has pushed back against conspiracy theorists who made claims of election fraud.
In addition, studies have repeatedly indicated there was no evidence noncitizen voting was occurring in significant numbers in United States elections.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been working to develop a searchable national database that election officials could use to verify voter eligibility. In June, NPR reported the Trump administration was planning the roll out in phases a national citizenship data system.
The initiative has drawn opposition among voting rights organizations and from privacy advocates concerned about development of a new centralized database containing personal information on citizens.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5210797-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-31 09:57:16.009612

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)How much could an unusual mid-decade redistricting push matter for control of Congress next year?
Experts are split, but generally see little advantage in the frantic activity by both parties to squeeze extra seats from lines that already favor Republicans in Texas and Florida and Democrats in California.
Texas Republicans proposed a new set of maps Wednesday, in response to a request from President Donald Trump to boost GOP numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives by redrawing the lines to favor Republicans. Left-leaning California, meanwhile, has pledged to retaliate by redrawing its congressional districts to create more Democratic seats.
The unusual plan to draw new districts in mid-decade for political purposes is not unprecedented — Republicans in Colorado and Texas moved to redraw districts after taking unified control of those states in 2002. But generally, states draw new districts only when federal law requires it after a new decennial census.
Trump reportedly asked Texas Republicans to target five Democratic incumbents to shore up their thin U.S. House majority against anticipated losses in midterm elections next year. He also pressured Missouri Republicans to redraw a Democratic Kansas City-area district. Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he would follow suit.
California has threatened a retaliatory plan to increase Democratic seats there and a Democratic super PAC has created a $20 million fund to target Texas Republicans next year as payback.
It’s not impossible for Texas to come up with five more Republican seats that would withstand legal challenge, said J. Miles Coleman, political cartographer at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. But Coleman said it would take some “creative line drawing.”
Paul Brace, an emeritus professor of legal studies science at Rice University in Houston, said the proposed Texas maps released today target Democrats in majority-minority districts in Houston, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and South Texas, where Trump showed surprising strength in last year’s election.
“They’re trying to dilute those areas with more white Republican areas to give themselves a better chance,” said Brace. He said he’s skeptical Texas Republicans can draw five more GOP seats that will withstand legal scrutiny, though they might be able to get one by redrawing the Houston-area district that has been unrepresented since Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner died in March.
Other changes are not as clear-cut, he said.
Kimball Brace, a redistricting expert and consultant in Virginia who is not related to Paul Brace, said Texas might have already reached its maximum number of GOP seats.
“The question about Texas is, are they already maxed out for Republican strength? There’s not much wiggle room left,” he said.
Kimball Brace said there may be some benefit to Republicans in redrawing South Texas districts, where Republican strength was greater than expected last year, but there’s nothing like five seats in play. He said he thinks California is in a similar situation, since for decades, California Democrats have drawn maps to maximize their advantage and might not have much more room to maneuver.
Coleman disagreed, saying he sees opportunities in both states for new seats.
“For the purposes of keeping score, Texas and California could basically cancel each other out. But I think Democrats would be hurt if the redistricting wars escalate beyond those states,” Coleman said.
Florida and Missouri could add more Republican seats, and theoretically Colorado, New York and Virginia could add more Democratic seats, but the Democratic states will run into self-imposed obstacles like redistricting commissions that limit partisan maneuvers, Coleman said. Republican-dominated Ohio will also be a factor, since it’s planning to redraw districts because of court fights.
“That will almost certainly be to the benefit of Republicans, so it’s another example of  Republicans having more levers to pull than Democrats,” Coleman said. .
Earlier this week, New York unveiled its own mid-decade redistricting plan, but it wouldn’t take effect in time for next year’s midterm elections.
Kimball Brace said Michigan, where he has worked as a consultant, could add more Democratic seats in theory, but a fragile compromise on a politically independent redistricting commission makes it unlikely.
Parties in power generally draw districts that favor their own with methods known as “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to concentrating opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means scattering opposition voters across districts, so they have little chance to influence votes.
Texas and Florida already have wrung more partisan advantage from their congressional seats than any other states, by one measure.
PlanScore, a project at Harvard Law School’s Election Law Clinic that measures bias in redistricting, found at least some partisan bias in congressional districts in many states where data on voter registration was available.
About two of California’s 52 U.S. House seats are Democratic but would be Republican under a perfectly balanced plan based on statewide party registration. Texas already squeezes about five extra Republican seats out of its 32 U.S. House districts, one of the most skewed maps in the country. Florida has an extra four GOP seats, out of 28 total.

,California,2025-07-31 12:32:00+00:00,CalMatters,She had to fight for help with medical bills. A new California bill could make it easier,Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/07/medical-debt-relief-hospitals/,A proposal advancing in the legislature would require California hospitals to pre-screen patients for charity care before sending out medical bills.,"In summary
A proposal advancing in the legislature would require California hospitals to pre-screen patients for charity care before sending out medical bills.


Sierra Freeman has a rare genetic disorder that makes her prone to aneurysms and has sent her to the hospital repeatedly. 
In July 2022, the Stockton resident had surgeries to repair an aortic tear and a ruptured blood vessel in her brain and spent two months at Stanford Medical Center, which hosts one of the leading programs in connective tissue disorders like the one Freeman has. 
Over the next 18 months, she racked up more than $4 million in medical bills, most of which was paid through her employee health insurance. Her share was $14,343, which she says she’d still be paying if not for Stanford’s financial assistance program. 
But Stanford, like many hospitals, didn’t make it easy for her. It took months of research and persistence on her part before the hospital waived $13,971.
“I feel like I now have the knowledge and power to apply for this the next time it happens. But I wish more people knew about it,” Freeman said. 
A bill moving through the California Legislature would make the process of qualifying for hospital financial assistance easier for some patients. Assembly Bill 1312 would require hospitals to check whether patients are eligible for charity care or discounted payments before sending them a bill. 
Specifically, the proposal would require hospitals to presume people enrolled in means-tested programs, such as food stamps and cash assistance, are eligible for financial aid without having to apply.  People who are experiencing homelessness or who qualified for assistance from the same hospital in the previous six months would be automatically eligible. 
It would also require hospitals to screen patients for eligibility if they are uninsured, enrolled in Medi-Cal with a share of cost or in a Covered California health plan before they are charged. 
“We think, especially in light of the cuts that are happening at the federal level, that more and more this is going to be something that is needed in our community and throughout the state,” Sen. Pilar Schiavo, a Santa Clarita Democrat and author of the bill, said during the most recent meeting of the Senate Health Committee. “This is a … way to ensure that people know upfront that these programs are available to them to prevent the kind of crushing medical debt that unfortunately can really ruin families and their financial situations.”

Sen. Caroline Menjivar, chair of the Senate Health Committee, promised to continue discussions with Schiavo to add screening criteria for moderate-income patients with employer-sponsored insurance. The legislation has to pass the Senate by Sept. 12.
The bill recently went through a round of amendments after negotiations with the hospital lobby. Among the changes is a two-year implementation delay so hospitals can acquire the software necessary to screen patients. If the bill makes it out of the Legislature and is signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the earliest it could be enacted is July 2027. The California Hospital Association continues to oppose the bill as it awaits more possible amendments.
Applying for financial assistance
Under California law, hospitals are required to make financial assistance programs, also known as charity care, available to patients who earn up to 400% of the federal poverty level — $62,600 for a single person or $128,600 for a family of four — but also to patients whose medical expenses over the last year have exceeded 10% of their income. 
Jan Emerson-Shea, a spokesperson for the California Hospital Association, said some hospitals go beyond that income threshold. Hospitals already promote their financial assistance programs through signs around the hospital, online and on medical bills sent to patients, Emerson-Shea said.
Still, many patients do not know about these programs, surveys and research have shown. A 2023 national survey by Dollar For, a nonprofit organization that helps people apply for financial assistance, found roughly half the patients who are potentially eligible for financial assistance do not apply.
Freeman said she doesn’t recall anyone at Stanford Medical Center telling her to apply for charity care, but she did find the application online. 
The first time she applied on her own she was denied, she said. She applied a second time, this time with the help from Dollar For. In April 2024 Freeman received a letter from Stanford letting her know that her balance was being waived. She was also able to get back the money she’d already paid.
But the application process was not intuitive, she said. It took help from experts and emails back and forth with the hospital billing department. Yet, given her condition, it’s a process she’s likely to have to do again.  
“The tricky thing is I’m supposed to be very low stress, right? Because I have a heart condition, and the disorder is made worse if your blood pressure is high, if you’re getting stressed,” Freeman said. “Like, I should be very calm, but I’m always thinking about the bills.”
The burden of medical debt
A handful of other states, including Maryland, Illinois and Oregon, have financial assistance screening requirements similar to what California is attempting. 
A recent report from Oregon’s health agency showed that in the first five months its state law was in effect, hospitals reported challenges — primarily, with the software from third-party vendors that hospitals purchased to help check people’s income against publicly available financial data sources. Oregon health officials estimated in January it would take up to nine months before the program ran smoothly.

Los Angeles County is working with the Hospital Association of Southern California to develop a presumptive eligibility tool that would be available to local hospitals, saving them the need to go to third-party vendors. 
“There’s nothing else like it in the country, and it really solves the problem of, OK, we know this is a good thing to do, but how do we make sure every hospital can do it?” said Dr. Naman Shah, with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. 
Automatic qualification for financial assistance is critical for preventing medical debt, Shah said.
About 4 in 10 Californians, or an estimated 15 million people, carry medical debt, according to the California Health Care Foundation. That includes hospital bills, but also debt owed to doctors and dental offices. Research has shown that even small amounts of debt can disrupt people’s lives and the fear of it often keeps them from seeking timely care.
Many patients who are unaware of financial assistance programs resort to GoFundMe accounts, borrow money from family or friends, or charge their medical bills onto a credit card, said Selene Betancourt, a senior policy manager at the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, one of the bill sponsors.
“And that makes it even harder to relieve because now it’s owned by a credit card company, a bank, and not by the hospitals,” Betancourt said. 
Given the pervasive burden of medical debt and the lack of federal action, states and local governments have taken it upon themselves to provide at least some relief. 
Last year, for example, the California Legislature passed a law to prevent medical debt from showing up on credit reports. The Biden administration announced a similar effort nationwide last summer, but recently, a judge, with support from the Trump administration, blocked the rule from taking effect.
At a more local level, Los Angeles County earlier this year rolled out a medical debt relief program, eliminating debt for approximately 134,000 residents so far, according to county health officials. 
To do this, Los Angeles County partnered with the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt to purchase debt in bulk at a discounted rate from health systems and collection agencies. The nonprofit runs similar projects in other states.
Debt relief efforts don’t fundamentally solve the issue of medical debt, “But when people are bleeding, they need a band aid,” said Allison Sesso, CEO of Undue Medical Debt.  “There could be future debts for these individuals, but let’s remove the ones that are in front of them, so that the hill isn’t that much higher for them to climb.”
Sesso’s organization last month also announced that a recent donation allowed the group to pay off medical bills for an additional 47,000 Californians, largely in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Those people should have started to receive notifications at the end of June, according to the nonprofit.

Wellington City, located in central Carbon County, is contemplating a 225.31% property tax hike on the average home. That means that a $277,000 property, the average home value in the city, would see a $527.59 annual increase, according to the Utah Taxpayers Association, a tax watchdog.

Other small municipalities, like Howell, a township of 237 residents; Eureka, of 661; Gunnison, of 3,600; and Uintah City, of 1,400 are studying tax increases ranging between 65.8% and 100%, the highest proposals in the state. 
While this is an annual routine for entities proposing raising taxes, Wellington City hadn’t seen a property tax increase since 2017, according to minutes from a May City Council meeting. 
“With the cost increase of everything — the city is needing to find a way to increase the money (it is) bringing in. The city receives sales tax, but even with that — it isn’t enough,” Barbara Clendennen, a financial consultant for the city said in the meeting, according to the minutes.



Let us know what you think...


 


At a June meeting, Clendennen said the proposed .005 property tax rate would help the budget, but it won’t be enough to cover the entire deficit. 
It’s “a tough pill to swallow” for residents on fixed incomes, Wellington Mayor Jack Clark said during that meeting. But, ultimately, the council approved sending the proposal to the Utah State Tax Commission for certification.
None of the proposals are final yet. During the August truth-in-taxation meetings, elected officials may approve, modify or reject the increases, according to the taxpayers association. 
“Truth-in-taxation meetings are a pivotal component of the taxation process in Utah,” Billy Hesterman, president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, said in a statement. “The feedback garnered during these meetings plays a crucial role in maintaining the fairness of taxes and ensuring that budgets undergo rigorous scrutiny before final approval. We hope that all taxpayers attempt to attend these meetings.”

Doug Jones, D-Alabama, attracted more than 80 people Wednesday night from Cullman, Blount and Marshall counties to a town hall for House District 11 Democratic nominee Alex Braswell.
Jones endorsed Braswell, a 30-year-old American Sign Language interpreter running in the special election for the seat in August, earlier this month. It is the only endorsement he’s made in the three House special elections with Democratic candidates this year. 
The former senator has not announced his plans for the 2026 gubernatorial race, but has not yet ruled out the possibility.
“We’ve got to get a Legislature out there, we’ve got to get a governor who really supports not just Medicaid expansion, but keeping this state healthy,” Jones said.
District 11 is solidly Republican, but Braswell, Jones and other Democrats stayed upbeat about their prospects Wednesday. 
“Cullman County is not completely Republican. I know that’s a shock. In the last election, there were only 89% of voters who voted for Donald Trump. In the 2020 election, it was 88%,” Ricky Browning, Cullman County Democratic Party chair, said in his opening remarks. “That leaves 11% who are seeking other options, who may be willing to join us in making our community serve everyone equally.”
Braswell is the first female candidate for the seat in history. The last contested general election in the district took place in 2006.
Attendees asked questions about Medicaid expansion, a lottery, mental health, gun violence, education and more. 
“All politics is personal. We need to not only talk to people, we need to listen to people, and we need to listen to their fears and concerns,” Jones said. “If we do that, somebody like Alex is going to be able to go down there and represent them, and not the special interest in Montgomery, Alabama that selected her opponent.”
Braswell said she is using social media platforms and personal connections to campaign, which Jones said there needs to be more of. 
“When she gets elected, she needs to do things like this on a regular basis. She needs to get out and invite people, and don’t just invite her friends, invite the community,” he said.
Braswell is campaigning on maintaining rights of disabled Alabamians and special education, transparency and smaller government involvement.
“ There are bills on the floor in the Alabama State Capitol right now that shouldn’t be here, like lodging tax in one county. Why has that gone all the way to the Alabama State Capitol when the county commission could solve that on their own?”
She will face Republican nominee Heath Allbright on Aug. 26. Braswell said she personally invited Allbright and other Republican leadership to the event at Wallace State Community College, although none showed up. 
“It’s not always about winning or losing. It’s about having a voice,” Jones said.
A voter asked Braswell and Jones about dealing with hate she and other Democrats receive online, to which she said “bring it on.”
“You’re not going to get everybody. That’s not the way society and our elections are made. But if you get somebody thinking twice, you’ve accomplished something,” Jones said. “We need to get more involved. The social media algorithms play on hate and they play on fear, and we’ve just got to counter that with what we care about: community and people.”
Braswell asked for the audience to spread the word to anybody they came across, and for more campaign donations. According to campaign finance records, Braswell has raised almost $11,000, compared to Allbright’s $130,000. The Alabama House Majority Political Action Committee (PAC) donated $5,000 to Allbright’s campaign in March.
“I’m not Heath Allbright. I don’t have $130,000 in campaign funding, given directly to me from Montgomery,” Braswell said. “Every penny I’ve spent, every penny I’ve been given, has been given from folks like you.”
Jones wants Democrats to relive the feeling of his 2017 special election victory with Braswell, and believes it’s possible.
“I know how you felt on December the 12th, 2017 when Alabama elected the first Democrat (to the U.S. Senate) in 25 years. I want you to feel that way again on August 26,” Jones said. “This is a special election, which means there’s a special and unique opportunity to send a message to folks that the status quo is not always right. The status quo is not always acceptable.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0123-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 08:43:21.250396

Brett Compston, who leads Nevada’s Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, warned members of the Nevada Resilience Advisory Committee that the state will only be able to fund “only the existential, sustainment-type projects.”
The Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to cut its Urban Areas Security Initiative program, according to memos reported on by CNN last week, though it has not told states or formally announced it. Last year, Nevada received around $4.4 million through the UASI  program, which was established after 9/11 to provide funding for high-threat, high-density urban areas, like the Las Vegas Strip.
“The assumption that we have to operate on is that we will not receive UASI,” said Compston.
That means the state will have to spread money from a separate FEMA grant program, known as the State Homeland Security Grant, across the entirety of the state, he added.
Complicating matters are new requirements set by the Trump administration for those homeland security grants. Most prominent among the new requirements: States must now spend 10% of their funding on “supporting border crisis response and enforcement.”
Nevada expects to receive roughly $4 million in these grants, meaning it will have to spend approximately $400,000 on immigration actions, which Compston said could include information sharing and support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
The end result is there will be “$3.6 million that we have available to spread across all the things that we traditionally spend on,” he added.
Cary Underwood, representing the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center, asked whether existing activities related to watchlists of transnational actors might satisfy the new requirements set by FEMA.
Compston responded that he didn’t know but his office has contacted FEMA to request additional information and clarification.
Compston also said significant changes were made to another FEMA program called the Emergency Management Performance Grant, though he did not elaborate.
“There are, I don’t want to say intensive, but, different requirements,” he said.
The Nevada Resilience Advisory Committee will meet the morning of Aug. 6 to rank possible emergency management projects by priority. Then, those plans must be accepted by two back-to-back homeland security meetings scheduled for Aug. 8. That will leave the state with just two full days to finalize all of the paperwork and submit them by FEMA’s set deadline.
The advisory committee is composed of 34 members representing Nevada cities, counties, law enforcement, fire departments, educational agencies and other public agencies.
Compston told the members he “cannot overemphasize the importance” of the meeting, both because of the difficult task of prioritizing funding requests and because the shortened timeline leaves “no error room.”
It’s “normally a 60-day process that’s squeezed into 13” days, he added. “But I have great confidence in this team.”
FEMA typically issues what’s known as a “notice of funding opportunity” in the spring. This year, the notices for the State Homeland Security Grant and Emergency Management Performance Grant programs were not issued until July 28, leaving states across the country scrambling to write or adjust their applications under an accelerated timeline. No information has been given regarding the Urban Areas Security Initiative.
Compston, in an emailed statement to the Nevada Current Wednesday, emphasized that FEMA has “not issued a formal decision regarding (UASI’s) cancellation” and that his office is “closely monitoring ongoing discussions at the federal level regarding the future” of the program. He described their current efforts as “proactive.”
The agency, he also wrote, “remains committed to ensuring Nevada is well-prepared for all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other critical incidents.”
Compston did not offer additional clarity on how immigration enforcement dollars might be spent, but wrote that their plan “will adhere to federal guidelines while ensuring investments align with the unique priorities and risks faced by our state.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office did not respond to emailed questions from the Current about whether the governor is concerned about the reduction in federal funding for emergency preparedness, or whether he believes the state should spend its available money on immigration enforcement.
Backlash from Democrats
U.S. Rep. Dina Titus earlier this month led Nevada’s Democratic delegation in a letter urging U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to issue the notice of funding opportunity for FEMA’s Urban Area Security Initiative grants.
The letter noted that UASI grants were used to purchase equipment used by emergency personnel during the mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip in October 2017. It also noted that the billions of dollars in funding for the grant programs was approved by Congress.
CNN would later report that FEMA intends to end the UASI grant program entirely.
Titus in a statement provided to the Current called the decision to end the program “deeply irresponsible” and said it “endangers our public safety.”
She continued, “These grants played a significant role in the response to the Harvest Festival shootings and are critical to protecting the public in all major cities and at big events such as the Super Bowl, Formula One races, and golf tournaments. I implore Secretary Noem to administer these public safety grants as Congress directed and ensure that our first responders and emergency personnel have the tools they need to address future threats in our communities.”
Meanwhile, a group of 20 Democratic attorneys general, including Nevada’s Aaron Ford, have sued over the new requirements tying emergency and disaster preparedness and relief funding to state immigration enforcement actions.
The attorneys general argue the requirement violates the Constitution and forces states “to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other.”
Other federal funding canceled
The State of Nevada is also scrapping a number of planned projects due to the cancellation of FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program. FEMA announced the program’s cancellation in April and said it would rescind $882 million of not-yet-spent money nationwide.
“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” read a statement from a FEMA spokesperson. “It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.”
According to a report prepared for the Nevada Resilience Advisory Committee, the state expects the loss of $12.2 million of previously awarded funds, resulting in the cancellation of seven projects.
Those projects include improvements at the Hobart Creek Reservoir, which is part of the water system servicing Carson City, and construction of three solar power stations for the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District and two generators for communities in Douglas County.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2215283558-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 08:43:21.250396

The statue of Parks should be placed on the Alabama State Capitol steps, near the main entrance of the building, facing those coming up the stairs to the Capitol. The Keller statue will be to the left of the back entrance, facing the current Statehouse. That building is expected to be demolished after a new statehouse is completed and is expected to be replaced by green space.
A significant portion of the meeting focused on the plaques for each statue. The finalized language for the Rosa Parks plaque is in production. For the Helen Keller plaque, discussions centered on ensuring a Braille translation on the plaque accurately reflects the approved text.
Steve Murray, director of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, pointed out a minor punctuation change to currently reflect the translation to Braille and improve the flow of the Keller plaque text. The text the commission approved for the plaque separates two sentences with a comma, but the two sentences are separated by a comma in the Braille translation, creating a run-on sentence.
“If this is the text that they converted to Braille and understand the time constraints, there’s nothing wrong with proceeding this way. It doesn’t quite match what came out of the Commission’s approval process along the way, but it is, it’s very close to it,” Murray said.
Jennifer Oldenburg, deafblind project coordinator with the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind (AIDB), said that she’ll likely be able to expedite the change to prevent delaying the unveiling ceremony.
“I might be able to swing that,” Oldenburg said
Keith Owens, president of MBA Engineers, preparing the sites where the statues will be installed,, said that construction on the statue sites for both the Parks and Keller statues is ahead of schedule and anticipated to be complete within the next 30 days, with concrete work complete and currently curing.
“It is a little bit ahead of the printed schedule, but it’s roughly in the time frame when we thought it was going to be about 45 days,” Owens said to the commission.
Chase Tourney, a representative from Clark Memorials working on the plaques, said that Parks’ plaque has been ordered, and he is working to finalize the plaque for Keller to include the discussed changes.
“(The updated Braille plaque is) the one thing we need to expedite as fast as we possibly can, just to make sure we get it ordered,” Turney said.
Jay Warren, Oregon-based sculptor designing the Keller statue, did not provide an update on the statue’s progress at the meeting, but in July 2024, he said the statue was nearing completion. Georgia-based artist Julia Knight, responsible for designing the Parks statue, said in May 2024 that the statue was complete.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rosa-Parks-Capitol-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-31 08:43:21.250396

ELKO, Nev. — At the Two Spirit Conference in northern Nevada in June, Native Americans gathered in support of the LGBTQ+ community amid federal and state rollbacks of transgender protections and gender-affirming health care.
“I want people to not kill themselves for who they are,” said organizer Myk Mendez, a trans and two-spirit citizen of the Fort Hall Shoshone-Bannock Tribes in Idaho. “I want people to love their lives and grow old to tell their stories.”
“Two-spirit” is used by Native Americans to describe a distinct gender outside of male or female.
The conference in Elko reflects how some tribal citizens are supporting their LGTBQ+ community members as President Donald Trump rolls back protections and policies. In March, the National Indian Health Board, which represents and advocates for federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native tribes, passed a resolution declaring tribal sovereignty over issues affecting the Native American community’s health, including access to gender-affirming care.
The resolution calls on the federal government to preserve and expand programs that support the health and well-being of two-spirit and LGBTQ+ Native Americans. Tribes and tribal organizations are navigating how to uphold their sovereignty without jeopardizing the relationships and resources that support their communities, said Jessica Leston, the owner of the Raven Collective, a Native public health consulting group, and a member of the Ketchikan Indian Community.
In January, Trump signed an executive order recognizing only two sexes — male and female — and another to terminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within the federal government.
An Indian Health Service website describing two-spirit people was removed this year but restored following a court order. The page now has a disclaimer at the top that declares any information on it “promoting gender ideology” is “disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”
Two-spirit is not a sexual orientation but refers to people of a “culturally and spiritually distinct gender exclusively recognized by Native American Nations,” according to a definition created by two-spirit elders in 2021. According to two-spirit leaders, people who did not fit into the Western binary of male and female have lived in their communities since before colonization.
 
Already, tribal citizens and leaders say some people have had trouble accessing gender-affirming care in recent months, with some community members being denied hormone treatments or having their medications delayed, even in places where gender-affirming care remains legal. Panic has spread, and tribal citizens have considered leaving the country.
“There is a chilling effect,” said Itai Jeffries, who is trans, nonbinary, and two-spirit, of the Occaneechi people from North Carolina, and a consultant for the Raven Collective.
Mendez said he requested hormone treatment at his local Indian Health Service clinic at the end of June and was told by his provider that the facility has had trouble receiving the treatment for patients.
Lenny Hayes, a two-spirit citizen of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate in South Dakota, said the Indian Health Service clinic on the reservation also isn’t dispensing hormone treatment, though it is legal for people 18 and older. Hayes is the owner and operator of Tate Topa Consulting and provides educational training on two-spirit and LGTBQ+ Native Americans and Alaska Natives.
The National Congress of American Indians passed a resolution in 2015 to encourage the creation of policies to protect two-spirit and LGBTQ+ communities. And the organization adopted a resolution in 2021 to support providing gender-affirming care in Indian Health Service, tribal, and urban facilities.
The National Indian Health Board’s resolution cites homophobia and transphobia as contributing to higher rates of truancy, incarceration, self-harm, attempted suicide, and suicide among two-spirit young people. The board also lists health disparities among the broader Native LGBTQ+ population, including increased risks of anxiety, depression, and suicide.
Two-spirit and LGBTQ+ Native American and Alaska Native young people are particularly vulnerable to depression, suicidality, and sexual exploitation. In Minnesota, a 2019 state survey found that two-spirit and LGBTQ+ Native American and Alaska Native students had the highest rates of those ages 15-19 who responded “yes” to having traded sex or sexual activity for money, food, drugs, alcohol, or shelter.
Tribal leaders are also concerned that Medicaid cuts recently approved in Trump’s budget law will undercut efforts to expand testing and treatment for HIV infection in Native American communities.
The rates of HIV diagnosis among Native American and Alaska Native gay and bisexual men increased 11% from 2018 to 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Despite this increase, Native American and Alaska Native gay and bisexual men are among the groups with the least access to HIV tests outside of health care settings, such as community-based organizations, mobile testing units, and shelters.
As tribes respond to state and federal regulations of two-spirit and LGBTQ+ people, organizations and communities are focused on providing information and resources to protect those in Indian Country, even from the president.
“He will never, ever wipe out our identity, no matter what he does,” Hayes said.

It all starts with a shift in mindset.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Carl Szlachetka: Hard choices in health care and education bring new opportunities.","This commentary is by Carl Szlachetka, a member of the Copley Hospital board of trustees.


Anyone who reads the news or pays even limited attention to what’s happening in Montpelier knows that Vermont’s education and health care systems are nearing a breaking point. 
Declining birth rates, shrinking student populations, and double-digit increases in property taxes and health insurance premiums are making it difficult — if not impossible — for Vermont families to make ends meet.
According to the Agency of Human Services, our health care system is in the midst of an affordability crisis at a time when Vermonters can least afford it. Individuals and businesses are watching health care costs — for themselves and their employees — rise beyond what they can reasonably pay. 
At the same time, health care providers and insurers are facing negative operating margins and uncertain financial futures. Something has to change, and Vermont’s Act 68, enacted in 2025, is an early step toward that change.
Act 68 directs hospitals to make nearly $106 million in spending cuts for fiscal year 2026, with further reductions in subsequent years. This includes an estimated $135 million in savings from a new cap on provider-administered drug prices created through Act 55, which was also passed in 2025. 
These cuts will undoubtedly reshape how health care is delivered in Vermont, and that leads us to the first hard choice: Do we resist change and cling to the status quo, or do we explore solutions that could lower costs and increase access to primary care and other services?
On the education side, similar challenges are driving big decisions. 
Act 73, recently passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor, will consolidate the number of school districts from 185 to — possibly — fewer than 20. It also sets minimum class sizes and aims to eliminate duplicative administrative costs. 
The upside is that school funding will be less dependent on property taxes. School funding will still be sourced through property taxes, but it will now fund all schools with a foundation formula based on a base rate per pupil with additional funds for student needs. The downside is that many of the state’s smaller schools may need to merge with larger, nearby ones. 
In the coming year, focus groups will identify $106 million in potential savings — short-term, medium-term and long-term — by analyzing and rethinking areas such as payer-provider contracting, hospital reserve fund usage, shifting care to non-hospital settings, regionalizing services and administration, and reducing discretionary spending. 
While the choices will be difficult, the potential opportunities are significant. Much depends on how open Vermonters are to change. 
Let’s break these five areas down:

Payer/provider contracting: One group will explore how consumers, providers and the state can better share health care-related costs, ensuring access to high-quality care for all Vermonters.
Hospital reserve funds: Another group will assess how much “cash on hand” hospitals truly need — and whether some of those funds can be responsibly redirected.
Non-hospital care: Some groups will consider ways to shift appropriate services out of hospitals and into less expensive settings.
Shared services: By regionalizing services like IT, administration and purchasing, we can reduce duplication and improve efficiency.
Discretionary spending: Focus groups will examine which expenses are essential and which can be eliminated without compromising care.

Each group will submit a proposal to the state with specific strategies and estimated cost savings. Some may find immediate opportunities, especially in contracting, reserve fund use and discretionary spending. Others — such as shifting care and regionalizing services — may yield a mix of short-, medium- and long-term solutions.
The work does not stop there. Over the longer term, focus groups will also develop hospital-specific transformation plans, identify ways to strengthen primary care access and sustainability, and propose regional service delivery models to reduce duplication while preserving access.
With change comes uncertainty — and with uncertainty, resistance. But if we’re willing to think outside the box and move beyond “the way we’ve always done things,” we could not only lower costs but also increase access and quality. 
If we can reduce duplication and establish regional centers of excellence, where compassionate care is delivered by well-compensated professionals at sustainable costs, we may finally be on the path to solving Vermont’s health care crisis. It all starts with a shift in mindset.
Act 68 and H.454 are here to stay. If we truly want to attract new families and businesses to Vermont — and if we want our young people to stay and become the next generation of doctors, nurses, educators and tradespeople — we must rethink how we educate and provide care.

Gen. Lawrence Muennich, the Adjutant General of the Indiana National Guard. (Courtesy of ING)In just a few weeks, one Hoosier member of law enforcement will get a rare recognition: one of the Department of Child Services’ challenge coins honoring “a heroic act that protected a Hoosier child.”
“Our coins are awarded to individuals who demonstrate the characteristics featured on the coin — the courage of a lion, the thick skin of a rhino and the heart of a teddy bear,” a DCS spokesperson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “These coins are awarded on a limited basis, by our director only, and intended to honor someone’s service to DCS, a heroic act, perseverance and dedication to child welfare.”
Recipients include former foster children now “thriving” in adulthood, DCS team members retiring after decades working in child welfare and community heroes, such as the law enforcement officer set to receive one from DCS Director Adam Krupp.

The 2025 445-coin order cost the department $1,495.20, according to an invoice shared by the agency. By ordering in bulk, the per-coin price dropped from $4.80 to $3.36 and included no upgraded edges or thickness — though both sides are the characteristic Indiana blue and gold. 
Not all agencies or elected officeholders have the emblems. Gov. Mike Braun and Attorney General Todd Rokita don’t have one — but both Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith and Secretary of State Diego Morales do. 
While the Indiana House of Representatives doesn’t have a coin, the Senate allows members to purchase the coins from their own funds, according to Sen. Travis Holdman, the Republican Majority Caucus Chair. 
“We have probably ordered more than 1,000 challenge coins for our constituents to have,” Holdman, from Markle, estimated. “Some have really embraced it.”

Holdman guessed that nearly everyone in the 40-member caucus had purchased one.
“I think it’s a sign of friendship and a sign of loyalty and dedication,” Holdman said, about his personal practice in distributing the tokens.
 What are challenge coins?

Challenge coins are traditionally small medallions with a special design used to commemorate a special team or event. Oftentimes, these coins are used in the military and, according to the U.S. Department of Defense, have been used for a century in America “to instill unit pride, improve esprit de corps and reward hard work and excellence.” 
The origin of the tradition is a little murkier, “probably,” the agency concludes, because it “didn’t start as an officially sanctioned activity.” A popular story posits that a wealthy lieutenant in World War I gave each of his unit members a bronze medallion as a memento but Roman soldiers also received special coins for their service.
The legend goes on to say that the WWI lieutenant was once trapped behind enemy lines and found refuge with French allies — who recognized him because of his challenge coin and granted him safe passage. 
Holdman referenced this story in his own recounting of the coin’s importance, sharing that his son received a challenge coin upon graduating from officer school in the Air Force.
“That’s become a tradition,” said Holdman. 
Secretary of Public Safety Jennifer-Ruth Green is looking into ordering her own coins, an office spokesperson confirmed. The combat veteran has a long military career with the Air Force and will grant coins to those who go “above and beyond” to keep Hoosiers safe.
The coin will also feature her motto as secretary, “people first, safety always.”

Green oversees the Department of Homeland Security as part of her duties. The department shared details about two other recently purchased challenge coins: the Cobalt Magnet Challenge Coin and the CERT Challenge Coin. 
The former recognizes those who participated in the Cobalt Magnet Radiological and Nuclear Multistate Exercise in March, which the U.S. Department of Energy said included more than 70 agencies across both the United States and Canada. One hundred coins were purchased at a cost of $470.80 in January, as detailed in an invoice shared by the agency. 
The National CERT Conference for emergency managers, instructors and more will be held in Plainfield this fall and have its own coin. DHS purchased 500 of those for $2,350.08 in May — though grant funding covered the cost. 
The Indiana State Police doesn’t have one as an agency but the office told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that several sections, with permission, have designed and ordered challenge coins for themselves and purchased them as a group.
Additionally, their dedicated museum offers challenge coins for purchase.
In a military setting, challenge coins can even be a way to establish an alliance between countries, as shown in the collection of Brig. Gen. Lawrence Muennich, the Adjutant General of Indiana’s National Guard.
“Military challenge coins are a significant way for senior leaders to recognize and commemorate exceptional service, accomplishments, or significant events in one’s military career. They are also a form of respect between allied forces, visiting dignitaries, and other senior leaders. When given, they signal mutual respect and enduring partnership,” said a Guard spokesperson.
An in-house graphic designer for ING designed Muennich’s coins, which feature a state cutout along with the signature of the state’s 60th adjutant general. The 500-coin purchase of $2,092 was paid for by funds from the State Armory Board — which has its own public administrative board and earns funds from renting out the state’s various armories.

But the practice has spread beyond its military roots. It’s unclear when individually elected offices and agencies not affiliated with the military or law enforcement picked it up in Indiana. An cBay seller specializing in challenge coins offers one from a former Indiana State Secretary of Commerce and another from 2023 Indiana National Guard mission. 
Holdman said he would “never” approve to purchase the coins as a state expense for senators and said he wasn’t previously aware that some state agencies had their own emblems. 
“An agency like DCS needs to do absolutely everything they can to establish goodwill — so I would certainly give them a pass,” Holdman said after learning about the practice. “But if it’s a state elected official — I would never turn in a bill to have the Senate pay for anything like that.”
 So who else has one?

The Office of Lieutenant Governor first told the Indiana Capital Chronicle it had no comment on its challenge coins — until it learned the ICC had already confirmed their existence in an unrelated public records request. 
According to the March emails, chief legal counsel Devin Norrick — an attorney with close legal ties to Beckwith’s church — sought legal guidance on whether the lieutenant governor’s challenge coin could feature a cross or bible verse. 
A photo from the office shows that one side includes the Indiana state flag while the other features the state seal — a buffalo jumping over a log in a meadow. That side also includes the words “Faith, Family, Freedom” with Matthew 6:33, a short verse directing followers to “seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”

“The Lt. Governor does have a challenge coin. He is proud to carry on this long-standing tradition by sharing them with his fellow Hoosiers,” the office said, declining to provide the coin’s cost. 
The office also appears to have another coin design, according to constituents on social media, though it’s unclear where it came from or if it was purchased using state funds.
Secretary of State Diego Morales’ Office said he gives his coin to law enforcement officers, emergency responders, election administrators, members of the military, federal agency officials and more.
Morales distributes the coins himself and doesn’t provide them upon request, a spokesperson said.
“I am proud to carry on the long-standing tradition of presenting challenge coins—which are a modest but significant gesture rooted in military custom, to honor excellence, dedication, challenge, commitment, sacrifice, and accomplishment in public service,” said Morales. “As Indiana’s only current military veteran statewide officeholder I believe Hoosiers join me in valuing the history and meaning of presenting a state office challenge coin.”
Morales served with the Indiana National Guard.
The office didn’t provide an invoice, which might include design costs and other details such as size, but reported that they purchased 2,000 coins in 2024 at a cost of $3.60 each, or $7,200 total.
The Winchester News-Gazette reported in January 2024 that Morales gave a coin to a local county clerk and shared a more personal connection to the tradition. According to the publication, Morales said he received a challenge coin as a thank you from Maj. Gen. R. Martin Umbarger.


“I said, if someday I have the opportunity to do that, I will do it,” Morales told the News-Gazette. “Now that I’m an elected official, I’m able to do my own challenge coin … This is my way for me to say, specifically for my team … thank you.”

When we vote, our choices help shape the communities we live in and the future we believe is possible. Now, Michigan voters have more ways to vote than ever before and options like early voting mean that voting is more accessible. That is cause for celebration! Early voting is a great option for the student with a busy class schedule, the rural voter that lives far from a polling location, the working mom juggling a million things, or anyone that wants to feel the excitement of feeding their ballot through a tabulator, but has other plans on Election Day.
Recently, the Michigan Department of State released a report that highlighted Michigan’s record voter turnout in the November 2024 General Election. In fact, Michigan ranked third in the country in terms of turnout with 5.7 million people or 74.6 percent of eligible voters voting. And over 1.2 million voters took advantage of our newest voting option, early voting, when it came time to cast their ballots.
As pro-voter advocates, we are constantly working to modernize our elections to make them more secure and accessible for voters. When we reduce obstacles to voting, we see better representation at the ballot box. This ultimately means that we have lawmakers who more accurately reflect the values of our communities and who will fight for the issues that we care about. By creating more options for voters to register and cast their ballots, we are welcoming more people into the voting process and building a more inclusive democracy.
And the people of Michigan also support common-sense approaches to removing barriers to voting. After all, voters went to the ballot box in 2018 and again in 2022 to overwhelmingly support pro-voter initiatives including same-day voter registration, no reason absentee voting, the permanent mail ballot list, and early voting (among others). These initiatives, now enshrined in the Michigan Constitution, send a clear message from voters: we want options! It also moved Michigan from a bottom rank in terms of accessible elections to the top of the class.
But it’s never enough to just pass legislation or approve a ballot initiative. An equally important part of the work is in the implementation of the policy and ensuring that voters know about their new rights, and that takes time and commitment. Organizations like ours that worked to get Promote the Vote (Prop 3 of 2018) and Promote the Vote 2022 (Prop 2 of 2022) on the ballot spent the ensuing years working with the legislature to pass implementing legislation and partnering with dozens of organizations across the state as well as with local election officials to educate voters about their new rights.
The nonprofit, pro-voter advocacy community spent months educating voters, especially in the lead-up to the General Election in November. Over 50 organizations engaged in coordinated efforts to educate voters through early voting parties across the state, countless community events, door knocking, phone calls, and text messages, targeted digital ads as well as ads in movie theaters, newspapers (in multiple languages), and on buses and billboards across Metro Detroit. And it worked! Voters turned out in droves to early voting sites in November because it was a convenient option.
Of course provisions like early voting means more work for our local election officials, and we are grateful and require additional resources, but full participation in our democracy is priceless. We must work to let both our state and federal lawmakers know that our elections are a priority and that they must be adequately funded.
As we look ahead, there is still work to do in terms of improving access to the ballot box. Last year we worked to pass the Michigan Voting Rights Act which would improve language access for voting materials and improve access for voters with disabilities. Although we were not successful (yet!), the pro-voter advocacy community is organized, prepared, and motivated to see this legislation cross the finish line and to continue to secure our spot as a national leader for in accessible elections.

Some unusual witnesses helped convict Alex Murdaugh of the murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul.
The first was Bubba, Maggie’s yellow Labrador retriever. Prosecutors used a recording of Bubba to place Murdaugh at the site of the murders. Given his presence at the crime scene, other witnesses then revealed his movements, tracked his speed and explained what he had in his hands. Those other witnesses were a 2021 Chevy Suburban and Maggie, Paul and Alex Murdaugh’s cellphones, which all provided data.
They’re all part of the Internet of Things, also known as IoT.
The privacy implications of devices connected to the internet are not often the most important consideration in solving a murder case. But outside of criminal prosecution, they affect people’s privacy in ways that should give everyone pause.
The Internet of Things
The Internet of Things includes any object or device that automatically sends and receives data via the internet. When you use your phone to message someone or social media to post something, the sharing is deliberate. But the automatic nature of connected devices effectively cuts humans out of the loop. The data from these devices can reveal a lot about the people who interact with them — and about other people around the devices.
As an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina, I have watched as new kinds of connected devices have entered the market. New devices mean new ways to collect data about people.
Connected devices collect information from different contexts. Take your refrigerator. As a non-IoT device, your fridge generated no data about your kitchen, your food or how often you peeked inside. Your relationship with the fridge was effectively private. Only you knew about that midnight snack or whether you ogled a co-worker’s lunch.
Now, smart refrigerators can respond to voice commands, show images of the items in your fridge, track who opens it, suggest recipes, generate grocery lists and even contact your car to let you know the milk has expired. All these functions require continuous streams of data.
Device data and your privacy
Connected devices generate lots of data in contexts that have typically produced little data to make those situations “legible” to whoever can access the data.
In the past, if you wanted to monitor your heart rate, blood oxygenation, sleep patterns and stress levels, you might have undergone a battery of tests at a hospital. Specialized equipment in a controlled setting would have measured your body and make these parts of you visible to highly trained, licensed professionals.
But now, devices such as the Oura Ring track and analyze all that information continuously, in non-health care contexts.
Even if you don’t mind sharing data with an Internet of Things company, there are privacy risks to using a device like this.
In the health care context, a series of rules enforced by several groups make sure that connected equipment and the data the equipment generates have adequate cybersecurity protections. Away from that context, connected devices that perform similar functions don’t have to meet the same cybersecurity standards.
The U.S. Cyber Trust Mark program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission, is developing cybersecurity standards for smart devices.
But the program is voluntary.
In some states, such as Washington, state laws set standards for protecting health data from connected devices. But these laws don’t cover all data from all devices in all contexts. This leaves the devices, and the data they generate, particularly vulnerable to unwanted access by hackers.
Your inability to control who sees the data that connected devices gather is another privacy risk. It can give advertisers insights about potential customers. Absent a mandated opt-out, each device provider can decide what it does with customer data. Amazon, for example, recently removed the “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” option from the privacy settings of its popular smart speaker, Alexa.
Some connected-device providers participate in data markets, selling your data to the highest bidder. Sometimes those purchasers include government agencies. So, instead of needing a warrant to track your whereabouts or learn about activity in your home, they can purchase or access Internet of Things records.
A connected device can also compromise the data privacy of someone who just happens to be nearby.
Connected cars
Cars have joined the ranks of the Internet of Things.
The 2021 Chevy Suburban that helped convict Alex Murdaugh simply tracked information about the vehicle. This included the vehicle’s speed, the turning radius of the steering wheel and time stamps.
Most modern vehicles also incorporate data from external sources. GPS data and infotainment systems that connect to cellphones also track the vehicle’s movements. All of this data can also be used to track the whereabouts and behavior of drivers and other people in the vehicles.
And as vehicles become increasingly automated, they need to make driving decisions in increasingly complex situations. To make safe driving decisions, they need data about the world around them. They need to know the size, speed and behavior of all the nearby vehicles on the roadway, moment to moment. They need to instantly identify the best way to avoid a pedestrian, cyclist or other object entering the roadway.
If you and I are driving in separate cars on the same roadway, it means my car is collecting information about you. And if my vehicle is connected, then data about you is being shared with other cars and car companies. In other words, if a Tesla had been present at the scene of the Murdaugh murders, its outward facing cameras could have captured footage. Bubba’s testimony might not have been necessary.
Spillover data collection
Internet of Things devices generate data from similar situations in a highly structured way. Therefore, what data collectors learn about me from my connected device may also give them insights about someone else in a similar situation.
Take smart meters that share information with the water utility every 15 minutes. Imagine a subdivision with a narrow range of house and yard sizes. Water usage should be relatively comparable for each household. Data from even just a couple of houses can give a good sense of what water use should be for everyone in the neighborhood.
Without actually collecting data from each house, data from connected devices reveals potentially private information about similarly situated people.
Data from IoT devices can also fuel insights into people who never use or make contact with these devices. Aggregated data from Oura rings, for instance, could contribute to decisions a health insurer makes about you.
Connected devices are also changing. In addition to collecting data about the person using the device, a growing number of sensors collect information about the environment around that person.
Some of my research has examined what privacy means for people observed by vehicle sensor systems such as radar, lidar and sonar. These technologies capture potentially very revealing information about people and their property. Even the most comprehensive privacy laws in the United States offer people little recourse for the impact to their privacy.
Civilian drones are capable of gathering data about other people. But people observed by drones would have a tough time learning that data about them exists and an even harder time controlling how that information might be used.
Meanwhile, artificial intelligence systems are expanding the ways Internet of Things data can affect the privacy of other people by automating the process of training IoT systems. AI chipmaker Nvidia has created a digital environment, or model, where people can upload their connected device data.
This environment can help train IoT devices to “predict the outcomes of the device’s interactions with other people,” according to Nvidia.
Models like this make it easy for AI devices that you don’t own to collect data or reach conclusions about you. In other words, IoT data processed by AI can make inferences about you, rendering you legible to the AI system even before you interact with an IoT device.
Looking forward
Smart devices and the data they generate are here to stay. As the world becomes increasingly automated, I believe it’s important to be more aware of the way connected devices may be affecting people’s privacy.
The story of how vehicle data combined with cell data in the Murdaugh trial is a case in point. At the start of the trial, prosecutors came ready to show “phone call logs and texts, steps recorded, apps asking for information, GPS locations, changes when the phone went from vertical portrait mode to horizontal landscape mode and back, and — key to the prosecution’s case — when the camera was activated,” The Associated Press reported.
But that was probably not enough to merit a conviction. During the trial, General Motors called and said something like “oh wait, we found something” on the Suburban’s OnStar data, according to the prosecution. That vehicle data, combined with the cellphone data, told a story that Alex Murdaugh could not deny.
There are at least two lessons from this story. First, not even GM fully realized all the data it had collected in its vehicles. It’s important to be aware of just how much information smart devices are collecting. Second, combining data from different devices revealed incontestable details of Alex Murdaugh’s activities. Away from criminal court, combining data from multiple devices can have a profound effect on people’s privacy.
If people’s data privacy matters, how do we address this reality?
One way of potentially protecting people’s privacy is to make sure people and communities observed by connected devices have a direct say in what data the devices collect and how the data is used.

The private membership association, called Return to the Land, owns 160 acres in northeast Arkansas, according to its website. Jews and non-whites are explicitly banned from membership. 
The group’s leader recently said it is exploring the idea of expanding north and building a new enclave in the Springfield area. 
“We have the God-given right to form communities according to whatever values we hold dear,” Eric Orwoll, co-founder of Return to the Land, said in a recent social media post, “and the government does not have the right to tell free American citizens what values they have to live according to in their own private lives.”
The idea of a segregated community coming to southwest Missouri was greeted with scorn by both Democratic and Republican legislative leaders from the area. 
“Racism in any form is evil and reprehensible,” said House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican. “Groups engaging in racist conduct are not welcome in Springfield.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said history has been “very clear on what happens when you stay silent as groups discriminate based on race and discriminate based on whether or not someone is of the Jewish faith. I cannot believe that in 2025 we are retreading this ground.”
The Springfield City Council and City Manager David Cameron issued a joint statement this week declaring that “there is no place in Springfield, or anywhere, for such a divisive and discriminatory vision.”
“While it is improbable that such a project could legally or practically occur within city limits, silence is not an option,” the statement said. “As a regional leader, we will not stand idly by in the face of attempts to revive outdated, harmful ideologies.”
On its website, Return to the Land its mission is to “separate ourselves from a failing modern society, and we will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities.”
It also includes a disclaimer that the group does not engage in the sale or rental of real estate.
 State Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, speaks on a capital improvements bill during special session in June (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Orwoll responded to criticism from Springfield elected officials in his social media post, denying that excluding people of color and Jews should be considered racist. 
“We are not a hate group,” he said. “We have never expressed hate towards any ethnic group, racial group or religious group.”
He took umbrage with Fogle calling the group racist, saying: “She wants to call us racists because we prefer being among our own people.”
“It’s not a supremacist group. It’s not a hate group. It’s not even a white nationalist group,” he said. “We are white identitarians. We value our identity and want to preserve it. That’s not hate. That is love for your own people.”
Fogle, who was among the first public officials to condemn Return to the Land’s possible expansion to Missouri, said she has been inundated with “pretty horrific messages and pretty horrific responses” on social media. 
But she said she has no intention of being silent. 
“It’s my job to make sure I’m using my platform to communicate that there’s no place in Springfield, no place in Missouri, no place in this country for a group who is intentionally leaving behind people who have a different skin color or intentionally leaving behind people of the Jewish faith,” she said. “And I would expect every elected official at every level to use their platform to see the same things.”
Across the state line, the group also drew the ire of Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin. 
The Republican announced his office would open an investigation of the group to ensure its activities didn’t violate state or federal law. That probe, Griffin said in an email to The Independent, has not turned up any illegal activity. 
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey did not respond to requests for comment.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)How much could an unusual mid-decade redistricting push matter for control of Congress next year?
Experts are split, but generally see little advantage in the frantic activity by both parties to squeeze extra seats from lines that already favor Republicans in Texas and Florida and Democrats in California.
Texas Republicans proposed a new set of maps Wednesday, in response to a request from President Donald Trump to boost GOP numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives by redrawing the lines to favor Republicans. Left-leaning California, meanwhile, has pledged to retaliate by redrawing its congressional districts to create more Democratic seats.
The unusual plan to draw new districts in mid-decade for political purposes is not unprecedented — Republicans in Colorado and Texas moved to redraw districts after taking unified control of those states in 2002. But generally, states draw new districts only when federal law requires it after a new decennial census.
Trump reportedly asked Texas Republicans to target five Democratic incumbents to shore up their thin U.S. House majority against anticipated losses in midterm elections next year. He also pressured Missouri Republicans to redraw a Democratic Kansas City-area district. Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he would follow suit.
California has threatened a retaliatory plan to increase Democratic seats there and a Democratic super PAC has created a $20 million fund to target Texas Republicans next year as payback.
It’s not impossible for Texas to come up with five more Republican seats that would withstand legal challenge, said J. Miles Coleman, political cartographer at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. But Coleman said it would take some “creative line drawing.”
Paul Brace, an emeritus professor of legal studies science at Rice University in Houston, said the proposed Texas maps released today target Democrats in majority-minority districts in Houston, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and South Texas, where Trump showed surprising strength in last year’s election.
“They’re trying to dilute those areas with more white Republican areas to give themselves a better chance,” said Brace. He said he’s skeptical Texas Republicans can draw five more GOP seats that will withstand legal scrutiny, though they might be able to get one by redrawing the Houston-area district that has been unrepresented since Democratic U.S. Rep. Sylvester Turner died in March.
Other changes are not as clear-cut, he said.
Kimball Brace, a redistricting expert and consultant in Virginia who is not related to Paul Brace, said Texas might have already reached its maximum number of GOP seats.
“The question about Texas is, are they already maxed out for Republican strength? There’s not much wiggle room left,” he said.
Kimball Brace said there may be some benefit to Republicans in redrawing South Texas districts, where Republican strength was greater than expected last year, but there’s nothing like five seats in play. He said he thinks California is in a similar situation, since for decades, California Democrats have drawn maps to maximize their advantage and might not have much more room to maneuver.
Coleman disagreed, saying he sees opportunities in both states for new seats.
“For the purposes of keeping score, Texas and California could basically cancel each other out. But I think Democrats would be hurt if the redistricting wars escalate beyond those states,” Coleman said.
Florida and Missouri could add more Republican seats, and theoretically Colorado, New York and Virginia could add more Democratic seats, but the Democratic states will run into self-imposed obstacles like redistricting commissions that limit partisan maneuvers, Coleman said. Republican-dominated Ohio will also be a factor, since it’s planning to redraw districts because of court fights.
“That will almost certainly be to the benefit of Republicans, so it’s another example of  Republicans having more levers to pull than Democrats,” Coleman said. .
Earlier this week, New York unveiled its own mid-decade redistricting plan, but it wouldn’t take effect in time for next year’s midterm elections.
Kimball Brace said Michigan, where he has worked as a consultant, could add more Democratic seats in theory, but a fragile compromise on a politically independent redistricting commission makes it unlikely.
Parties in power generally draw districts that favor their own with methods known as “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to concentrating opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means scattering opposition voters across districts, so they have little chance to influence votes.
Texas and Florida already have wrung more partisan advantage from their congressional seats than any other states, by one measure.
PlanScore, a project at Harvard Law School’s Election Law Clinic that measures bias in redistricting, found at least some partisan bias in congressional districts in many states where data on voter registration was available.
About two of California’s 52 U.S. House seats are Democratic but would be Republican under a perfectly balanced plan based on statewide party registration. Texas already squeezes about five extra Republican seats out of its 32 U.S. House districts, one of the most skewed maps in the country. Florida has an extra four GOP seats, out of 28 total.

(Jazmin Orozco Rodriguez/KFF Health News)ELKO, Nev. — At the Two Spirit Conference in northern Nevada in June, Native Americans gathered in support of the LGBTQ+ community amid federal and state rollbacks of transgender protections and gender-affirming health care.
“I want people to not kill themselves for who they are,” said organizer Myk Mendez, a trans and two-spirit citizen of the Fort Hall Shoshone-Bannock Tribes in Idaho. “I want people to love their lives and grow old to tell their stories.”
“Two-spirit” is used by Native Americans to describe a distinct gender outside of male or female.
The conference in Elko reflects how some tribal citizens are supporting their LGTBQ+ community members as President Donald Trump rolls back protections and policies. In March, the National Indian Health Board, which represents and advocates for federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native tribes, passed a resolution declaring tribal sovereignty over issues affecting the Native American community’s health, including access to gender-affirming care.
The resolution calls on the federal government to preserve and expand programs that support the health and well-being of two-spirit and LGBTQ+ Native Americans. Tribes and tribal organizations are navigating how to uphold their sovereignty without jeopardizing the relationships and resources that support their communities, said Jessica Leston, the owner of the Raven Collective, a Native public health consulting group, and a member of the Ketchikan Indian Community.
In January, Trump signed an executive order recognizing only two sexes — male and female — and another to terminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within the federal government.
An Indian Health Service website describing two-spirit people was removed this year but restored following a court order. The page now has a disclaimer at the top that declares any information on it “promoting gender ideology” is “disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”
Two-spirit is not a sexual orientation but refers to people of a “culturally and spiritually distinct gender exclusively recognized by Native American Nations,” according to a definition created by two-spirit elders in 2021. According to two-spirit leaders, people who did not fit into the Western binary of male and female have lived in their communities since before colonization.
 
Already, tribal citizens and leaders say some people have had trouble accessing gender-affirming care in recent months, with some community members being denied hormone treatments or having their medications delayed, even in places where gender-affirming care remains legal. Panic has spread, and tribal citizens have considered leaving the country.
“There is a chilling effect,” said Itai Jeffries, who is trans, nonbinary, and two-spirit, of the Occaneechi people from North Carolina, and a consultant for the Raven Collective.
Mendez said he requested hormone treatment at his local Indian Health Service clinic at the end of June and was told by his provider that the facility has had trouble receiving the treatment for patients.
Lenny Hayes, a two-spirit citizen of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate in South Dakota, said the Indian Health Service clinic on the reservation also isn’t dispensing hormone treatment, though it is legal for people 18 and older. Hayes is the owner and operator of Tate Topa Consulting and provides educational training on two-spirit and LGTBQ+ Native Americans and Alaska Natives.
The National Congress of American Indians passed a resolution in 2015 to encourage the creation of policies to protect two-spirit and LGBTQ+ communities. And the organization adopted a resolution in 2021 to support providing gender-affirming care in Indian Health Service, tribal, and urban facilities.

The National Indian Health Board’s resolution cites homophobia and transphobia as contributing to higher rates of truancy, incarceration, self-harm, attempted suicide, and suicide among two-spirit young people. The board also lists health disparities among the broader Native LGBTQ+ population, including increased risks of anxiety, depression, and suicide.
Two-spirit and LGBTQ+ Native American and Alaska Native young people are particularly vulnerable to depression, suicidality, and sexual exploitation. In Minnesota, a 2019 state survey found that two-spirit and LGBTQ+ Native American and Alaska Native students had the highest rates of those ages 15-19 who responded “yes” to having traded sex or sexual activity for money, food, drugs, alcohol, or shelter.
Tribal leaders are also concerned that Medicaid cuts recently approved in Trump’s budget law will undercut efforts to expand testing and treatment for HIV infection in Native American communities.
The rates of HIV diagnosis among Native American and Alaska Native gay and bisexual men increased 11% from 2018 to 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Despite this increase, Native American and Alaska Native gay and bisexual men are among the groups with the least access to HIV tests outside of health care settings, such as community-based organizations, mobile testing units, and shelters.
As tribes respond to state and federal regulations of two-spirit and LGBTQ+ people, organizations and communities are focused on providing information and resources to protect those in Indian Country, even from the president.
“He will never, ever wipe out our identity, no matter what he does,” Hayes said.
