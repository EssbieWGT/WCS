(Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)As pennies vanish from the American landscape, many businesses are clamoring for federal guidance on how to handle cash transactions in a penniless world.
Should retailers round up or down? Should they round in favor of the customer? Or in favor of the business?
So far, calls for federal direction have gone unanswered. Some businesses are setting their own policies, but states are now beginning to act amid growing uncertainty.
While the question revolves around only a few cents per transaction, it does raise important consumer protection and legal questions for states to consider. Retailers must weigh threats of potential lawsuits, while policymakers worry about protecting the most vulnerable consumers who rely on cash for everyday purchases.
President Donald Trump in February moved to eliminate the penny from U.S. pocketbooks, citing the high cost of minting them — about 3.7 cents per penny. But even before the coin’s final production run last month, U.S. retailers and banks were reporting widespread penny shortages.
To provide clarity, lawmakers in New York have proposed legislation mirroring Canada’s rounding standard — up or down to the nearest five cents. And officials in Georgia and Utah have issued nonbinding guidance to businesses.
“States do not have the luxury of waiting for the federal government,” said Katherine Tschopp, senior associate at government relations firm MultiState.
Complicating the issue are the growing number of jurisdictions requiring businesses to accept cash — a move aimed at protecting vulnerable consumers who may not have access to credit cards or electronic payment systems.
In November, New York became the ninth state to add such a rule, according to tracking from MultiState. At least eight major cities also require businesses to accept cash.
A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers have proposed legislation in the U.S. House and Senate to require all cash transactions be rounded to the nearest five cents, but neither proposal has made it to a floor vote.
The record-breaking federal government shutdown and heated debate on health insurance subsidies have sidelined the penny discussion, Tschopp said. She thinks the federal government will likely determine a national rounding policy — eventually. But in the meantime, she expects more states to weigh in.
New York Democratic Assemblymember John T. McDonald III said he agreed with Trump’s move to phase out the costly production of the penny. But businesses are asking for some kind of guidance now, he said.
“In the absence of federal action, I think it’s important that the states act to provide clarity — clarity for everybody: clarity for the consumer, as well as the merchant and the state,” McDonald told Stateline.
Approaches to rounding
McDonald’s proposed legislation mirrors Canada’s rounding policy following the 2012 elimination of its one-cent coin. His bill calls for so-called symmetrical rounding of after-tax cash purchases to the nearest five-cent mark. Purchases ending with one, two, six or seven cents would be rounded down. And purchases ending in three, four, eight or nine cents would be rounded up.
So, a consumer would get no cash back from a $1.99 purchase. But a retailer would hand over a nickel to someone spending $1.97.
McDonald sits on the National Conference of State Legislature’s State and Local Taxation Task Force that has been examining the penny issue. That task force has recommended symmetrical rounding as the fairest method for merchants and consumers.
McDonald noted that the NCSL group reached a bipartisan consensus on the issue. And he said he’s found no opposition from New York businesses or consumer groups on his bill.
“In this day and age where we seem to have a lot of fractious conversations on other issues, it’d be nice to find something that actually we can all agree on,” he said. “And to have it start with the good old little penny would be a good spot.”
Last month, South Dakota Republican state Sen. Tim Reed urged state lawmakers to start communicating with agencies, retailers and the public over the issue.
A co-chair of the NCSL task force, he said businesses need guidance and consumers may need reassurance. While he acknowledged concerns about “strategic pricing” — in which retailers set prices to push rounding to their advantage — the group’s report characterized that as a “limited risk.”
“Everybody’s thinking, ‘Oh, I’ll get overcharged, or I’ll get undercharged,’” Reed said at an NCSL virtual event about the penny. He said it would be good for people to know that “really this is all going to kind of wash out in the end.”
New York Democratic state Sen. James Sanders Jr. said the cash acceptance law he sponsored in 2025 ensures people without access to smartphones or banking are not excluded from commerce. That law also says customers paying with cash cannot be charged more than other buyers.
“Otherwise, you absolutely have a two-tiered system,” he said, noting that cash is “a lifeline” for working families, older adults, immigrants and small businesses.
Sanders said he would prefer for retailers to round down to the nearest nickel on cash transactions to protect consumers.
“For the large corporations, this could be a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they are steadily rounding up,” he said. While each rounding transaction represents a loss or gain of only a few cents, Sanders said, “multiply that by tens of thousands of people, and you’ve effectively raised the price of your product without any type of sanction.”
Sanders said he plans to introduce legislation on the matter soon, but added that he remains open to McDonald’s current proposal of symmetrical rounding. More than anything, he said, businesses desire some kind of guidance.
“We’re not trying to cheat business. We’re just trying not to be cheated by business,” he said. “The people I’ve been speaking to are honest souls, and they just want to know the right thing to do in a penniless society.”
A rapid change
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia struck the last penny on Nov. 12, but pennies were already scarce at that time.
By mid-November, more than 100 of the government’s 165 coin distribution sites across the country were without pennies, according to the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents major chains including CVS, Target and 7-Eleven.
In a November survey of its members, that organization found six national chains had more than 1,000 stores that had no pennies.
The association said most of its survey respondents were rounding cash transactions to the benefit of customers — always down to the nearest five cents. While it’s fair for shoppers, it’s “costing businesses millions of dollars as small amounts add up across thousands of daily cash transactions.”
While states weigh the issue, the association is pushing for a federal answer.
“We are urging the federal government to quickly address the problem, to allow for uniform adjustments by retailers that operate in a multitude of states,” Austen Jensen, the organization’s senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement to Stateline.
Other groups, including the American Bankers Association, have also pushed for federal action.
“They’re obviously concerned about it and wanting a federal fix,” said Christopher Phillips, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight. “The government fairly abruptly decided they weren’t going to mint any more pennies and these shortages of pennies spread fairly quickly across the country.”
For retailers, the problem is both practical and legal, said Phillips, who represents payment system companies and financial technology firms.
In many of the jurisdictions that require merchants to accept cash, the laws explicitly forbid charging cash customers more — and have a per-transaction fine for violations, raising the possibility of big fees. And Phillips said merchants could face class-action lawsuits for rounding policies in which plaintiffs argue they are charged more than advertised or face unfair or deceptive business practices.
Federal regulations also ban retailers from charging more for purchases made with food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP. Cash rounding policies complicate that rule, as some customers would be charged less for certain cash purchases than those using SNAP cards.
“The unintended consequences of these administrative actions, and these laws and how they flow together to create real problems that were certainly never envisioned,” Phillips said.
So far, merchants have come up with their own policies.
Because of the penny shortage, the East Coast convenience store chain Sheetz asked customers to move to cashless payments or round up to support charitable causes. It even offered free beverages for those willing to cash in 100 pennies.
Kwik Trip, which operates convenience stores across the Midwest, in October announced its registers would automatically round down cash transactions to the nearest nickel in favor of customers.
But without a federal standard, the landscape is patchy, Phillips said. Rounding creates a winner and a loser in each cash transaction. Some companies have pushed to standardize their practice across the country, but others will only choose to round down if required.
“Others are like, ‘You know what? This is actual money for us,’” he said. “‘We’re not just going to give it up for the sake of convenience.’”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderA key program aimed at helping individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities gain access to home care may be getting a refresh in 2026.
Officials at Georgia’s Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities unveiled a series of proposals during a December board meeting aimed at restructuring the waiting list for a state-run Medicaid program that provides waivers to people with disabilities designed to keep them out of institutional settings. The waivers can be used to provide services like medical supplies, personal care assistants and emergency alert systems.
However, the proposals made to the board are just recommendations, and a timeline to move forward with the plan has not yet been set.
Georgia had over 7,800 people on a waiting list for waivers as of this past March, though the agency says not everyone who is on the list has an urgent need for services. Boosting state funding to provide services to more people has long been a perennial issue at the state Capitol, and there’s been a push in recent years to work toward ending the wait list entirely. 
Senate panel pushes for new money to support Georgians with disabilities, pay hike for caregivers

Members of an advisory council dedicated to addressing the issue say the first step to revamping the program will be to identify which applicants have the most urgent needs so their applications can be prioritized.
“When I hear on the street that we’ve got 7,000 people on a planning list, everybody panics,” said Bruce Lindemann, who serves as the chair of the state’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Advisory Council. “We need to understand, first, what comprises that planning list.”
Under a new proposal, Georgia’s existing waiting list would be restructured into a three-tiered system that distinguishes between those with urgent needs, those who are expected to need services in the next one to five years and those who may need services even further in the future. The council also recommended that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities create a new type of waiver for individuals with disabilities who don’t currently qualify for the New Option Waiver or Comprehensive Support Waiver Program, and implement a new assessment tool to improve data collection.
“Our charge is to ensure Georgia’s planning list assessment process is fair, accurate and aligned with national best practices, while remaining workable for DBHDD staff,” said Rita Young, the executive director of Participant Directed Advocates of Georgia, a nonprofit that supports individuals and families who participate in the two waiver programs.
Georgia leaders are also taking inspiration from states like Louisiana and Pennsylvania, which already have systems in place to prioritize waiver services based on the urgency of the applicant’s need.
D’Arcy Robb, the executive director of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, expressed cautious optimism about the board’s recommendations.
“I think the key is really going to be the implementation,” she said. “It’s going to require an ongoing commitment from the state, and I think in order to be done well, DBHDD needs to continue having very serious input and shared decision-making power with people with disabilities, their families and with organizations.”
As the state grapples with the impact of Medicaid funding cuts under the federal budget reconciliation package, colloquially known as the “big, beautiful bill,” Robb said she hopes state leaders will ensure that Georgians with disabilities continue to have access to the services they need.
“The problem is that [the bill] makes such big cuts to Medicaid, states are going to have to make hard choices,” Robb said. “We want to make sure that our state leaders are aware of the many ways Medicaid touches the lives of people with [disabilities], and that those are not impacted.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2122-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 05:11:41.309453

We talk about how aging, disability, grief, policy, public health, serious illness, long-term care, loneliness, stigma, silence, fear, culture, history, can impact the health of LGBTQ+ people.
We also discuss the dangers of the “single story” about the LGBTQ+ community and how it impacts the way this community is cared for, an idea drawn from a powerful talk by author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
Essentially, she explains, the single story creates stereotypes. And the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story. And it turns out, if we show a group of people as one thing over and over, they become only that one thing. Unfortunately, we do it all the time. Immigrants, people who are unhoused, people living with Medicaid and many more.

The class I teach takes stories and storytelling seriously. Their power in shaping how people think, feel and talk about LGBTQ+ people, and how to tell more complete stories and why it matters for creating a society and healthcare system where more people can actually thrive.
For their final exam, the students deliver a 5-minute talk challenging the single story around the LGBTQ+ community. Every semester, the stories literally take my breath away for their compassion, honesty, authenticity, creativity and humanity. This year, they were especially powerful.
Throughout the semester, 7 guest speakers come to talk with the class. We hear from a physician who is trans and taking care of patients on the East Coast; an assisted living manager caring for the some of the most vulnerable to fight loneliness, hopelessness and boredom among older adults; a researcher who studies cancer disparities among LGBTQ+ people; a grief counselor who specializes in the many ways grief impacts the LGBTQ+ community, especially disenfranchised grief, which is so common in this community; and a queer community historian that explains the role history has played in generating stigma, silence and fear.
Many of the students are queer. Many more are there because they love someone who is queer. Some are communication majors, but most of them are not. Attendance is so high and consistent, I don’t even need to take it.
Over the years, teaching this class has made me worry about the safety of my students and my own, because across the country, classes like this have been banned — or if not yet banned, targeted with demands that we be forced to stop teaching.
But do we really know what we won’t learn if these classes are banned?
Last month, our class had the final exam. One student told me that when her mom calls at the end of each week, this class is the only one she talks about with her — all the things she learned that week, like how the stress of living with chronic stigma takes up to 12 years off the life of LGBTQ+ people.
The student also told her mom about how a guest speaker described a grade school assignment. He was shown pictures of a dog, cat, tree, squirrel and told to circle the category that was not like the others. He circled the dog because the rest all could climb a tree. He was penalized in class for not choosing the tree. The guest speaker talked about how early these associations are taught and rewarded, and how quickly the conversations about why one is more right than the other becomes the single story.
The student also told me (and her mom) how she has fallen in love with writing for the first time. She said she appreciates how our course assignments break some of our common scripts in a way that gives people more space to answer questions and talk about their life.
Another student told me that this class is where she found “safety in a moment of chaos.” She said the class taught her “the importance of caring for others while also taking care of herself.” And that having this class for a few hours each week “gave her hope and made her believe in a better future.”
Another student told me it’s been the “best class she’s had all of college,” and that “she felt safe, heard and supported in every single class.”
One student brought a handwritten note to the final exam giving thanks for the semester, saying, “it was truly everything I needed and more.” After talking about disability for most of her assignments and final, after her father was in a horrific accident leaving him wheelchair-bound, she said she was leaving class inspired to do more.
Another student wrote after the class to say, it was “truly life-changing.”
I’m sharing their stories because this is what most professors want students to feel — safe, heard, seen, inspired, hopeful. Students don’t learn a specialized vocabulary in an LGBTQ+ course. We don’t have special books. Special slides. Students are not tested on queer facts or other queer things.
This class, like many LGBTQ+ classes, are about creating empathy, learning how to have better conversations, and ultimately, learning to take better care of each other.

A family huddled over the kitchen table, staring at their electric bill. Chalkboard signs in a coffee shop bemoaning Connecticut’s high energy costs. The incumbent Democratic governor promising to open new power plants, even if it means expanding natural gas.
As issues of affordability take center stage in this year’s midterm elections, Connecticut’s nagging struggle with high electricity bills is making its way to the top of early messaging in the state’s budding 2026 gubernatorial race.
Politicians and voters in Connecticut are no strangers to frustrations over their utility bills and the vexing efforts to lower them. For years, and across several election cycles, the state has ranked near the top in the nation for the highest average cost of electricity.
But with electricity prices nationally now rising faster than inflation, candidates in other states have begun to tackle the issue in ways that serve as a prelude to this year’s races.
In a handful of recent elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, for example, Democrats outperformed expectations by running on keeping utility rate hikes in check and raising warnings about the proliferation of power-guzzling AI data centers. The party’s earlier focus on adopting renewable, carbon-free power has given way to promoting the development of new nuclear reactors — and even natural gas — as a way of meeting rising demand without harming voters’ pocketbooks.

The shift in attention toward energy prices was evident at the 2025 national convention of state utility regulators in Seattle, according to Elin Swanson Katz, who previously led Connecticut’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of utility customers.
Katz, who now works as a consultant on energy issues, said the convention schedule was packed with panels discussing the trends that are driving up prices, as well as ways to maintain affordability while making investments in grid infrastructure and new sources of electricity.
“As someone who has spent my career largely as a consumer advocate and somebody who thinks about public engagement, it was a real sea change, something that I think we should have been talking about all along,” Katz said. “There’s no doubt, based on national polling, that consumers — customers — want affordable energy, but they also want investments in renewable so, I mean, there’s definitely tension on that.”
In April, a poll conducted by Ipsos and the consumer nonprofit PowerLines found that nearly three-quarters of Americans were concerned about rising energy costs, and nearly 60% said they felt their state governments were not doing enough to protect ratepayers.
Already, efforts have been made over the last year to address Connecticut’s energy costs. The results have been mixed.
In June, Gov. Ned Lamont — who is seeking a third term — signed legislation promising to save customers roughly $100 a year on their electric bills, mostly by borrowing money to offset portions of what’s known as the public benefits charge on customer bills.
Those savings were quickly dissipated, however, by a new rate hike for United Illuminating customers and the announcement of higher winter supply rates. 
The legislature’s efforts were also largely overshadowed by a clash between utility companies and their regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that resulted in the agency’s leader, Marissa Gillett, stepping down in October. While Gillett had been hailed by some, including Lamont, as a champion of consumers, critics accused her of skirting laws to exert control over the agency — a charge that was largely upheld in court.
At the same time, President Donald Trump’s efforts to steer federal energy policy in the direction of more fossil fuels has upended long-term investments that states like Connecticut have already made in pursuing cleaner forms of electricity such as solar and wind.
Noah Kaufman, an economist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, published a paper in November citing rising electric prices as an obstacle to Connecticut’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions. A lack of local fuel resources combined with high delivery costs and certain clean-energy programs all contributed to the state’s high cost of electricity, the paper found.
In an interview, Kaufman said candidates here may have to adjust their pitches to appeal to voters who are concerned about both costs and the climate.
“We have very ambitious decarbonization targets without an obvious plan for how to achieve them at this point,” Kaufman said. “Politicians may have to consider strategies that would have been off the table a few years ago — might not have seemed politically viable — because any sort of reforms are going to go up against constituencies that like the policies in place now.”

Recent elections elsewhere
Historically, electricity prices have tended to take a backseat to other pocketbook issues, such as taxes and gas prices, in political campaigns. That has changed as electricity prices have risen faster than inflation, on average, since 2022.
In New Jersey, one of two states that held gubernatorial elections in November, summer electric rates were up 22% compared to the previous year. 
“The No. 1, 2 and 3 issues in our race was Trump,” said Matthew Hale, an expert on New Jersey politics and professor at Seton Hall University. “But four, five and six were all affordability, and so energy was certainly a big deal,” he said. 
“Energy costs are something people see every single day. When they jump right in the middle of a campaign, it’s a big issue,” Hale said.
The winner of that race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, promised to freeze electric rates during her first year in office, though experts as well as New Jersey’s regulated utility companies questioned her ability to do so. She also criticized the state’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, for approving rate hikes as well as the Trump administration for scrapping federal support for solar panels and energy efficiency programs.
At the same time, Sherrill faced a barrage of attack ads from her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, that used selectively-edited footage of Sherrill appearing to say that voters should support renewable energy programs even if it costs them “an arm and a leg.” Sherrill was actually critiquing how other Democrats had spoken about such issues.
Hale said that Sherrill neutralized those attacks by talking about modernizing natural gas infrastructure and building new nuclear power reactors as part of her energy platform, in addition to her support for renewable energy.
“She didn’t lean into the environmentalists’ wing,” Hale said. “She just sort of said, ‘We need to do better.’ She didn’t back the idea that it was going to be nothing but renewables.”
In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her own affordability plan that focused on developing more generation from offshore wind, solar panels and small modular reactors — in addition to energy efficiency programs — as a way to bring down bills.
Spanberger also warned that the proliferation of data centers in Virginia was pushing the state toward an “energy crisis.” Her plan called for data center owners to pay their share of the cost to build the new power plants and transmission lines needed to power the facilities.
The Republican in that race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, said in interviews that Virginia’s data centers were “here to stay” and that she supported an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that included older, dirtier forms of generation such as coal.
Both Spanberger and Sherrill won their respective states by healthy margins. 
The 2025 elections also saw Democrats in Georgia flip two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility companies. The winning candidates in those races focused on recent price hikes and the need to transition away from fossil fuels.
Still, experts caution that elected officials generally have a limited ability to actually lower the price of electricity.
That’s because a large percentage of customers’ bills go to pay for things like the maintenance of the transmission and distribution system, which is also growing more expensive. In many states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, utilities purchase electricity from power plants, then sell that power to customers without any markup. While elected officials may appoint regulators to approve utility rates — in Connecticut, appointments to PURA are made by the governor — those regulators are typically expected to approve justifiable costs.
“Politicians make those decisions, and it’s going to affect things a little bit, but that’s not going to fundamentally fix the fact that Connecticut has really high energy prices,” said Erik Katovich, a professor of energy and resource economics at the University of Connecticut.
Katz, the former Connecticut consumer counsel, echoed that sentiment saying candidates such as Sherrill and Spanberger now face the tough task of formulating policies that will fulfill their promises to voters.
“I don’t think there’s any really fully developed policy in any of these states, because it’s really, really hard to do,” Katz said. “If there were simple answers we would have done it already. But, I do feel encouraged that so many smart, skilled, experienced professionals are now recognizing that affordability should be in the top two issues that we address around our electric system.”

What Connecticut candidates are saying
Since taking office seven years ago, Lamont has signed numerous climate-related measures, including a 2022 law that promised to eliminate greenhouse gases from the electricity supplied to Connecticut customers by 2040.
But with the cost of utility bills proving a perennial issue throughout his tenure, the centrist Democrat has been wary of pursuing a more immediate decarbonization agenda sought by many environmental advocates and those on the Left.
In a recent interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Lamont said that his is an “all-the-above” energy strategy that includes support for renewable such as solar and wind along with natural gas and the nuclear power supplied by the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford.
“In most cases, a lot of the renewables are also part of our long term solution to hold down costs,” Lamont said. “Natural gas — which I’ve been talking to our neighboring states and the White House about how it can replace some of the liquefied natural gas with more piped-in natural gas — that would be a lot less expensive and always on as well.”

Early last year, Lamont met with Trump administration officials in Washington, D.C., to discuss an expansion of pipelines that could deliver more natural gas into Connecticut and the rest of New England. In August, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection signaled its intent to approve a pair of compressor stations in Brookfield, expanding the capacity of the existing Iroquois Pipeline.
And while Lamont was an early backer of efforts to grow New England’s offshore wind industry, his administration has opted against buying into any new projects with the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, citing the rising costs of wind power.
Now, the governor faces challenges from both sides of the aisle over the cost of electricity and his commitment to the climate.

On the Republican side, state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart have both launched campaigns that zero in on the state’s high cost of electricity. 
(Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, is also reportedly mulling a run for governor but has yet to formally launch a campaign. Appearing on Newsmax in late December, she criticized offshore wind projects supported by Connecticut and other New England states.)
Fazio, who serves as the ranking Republican on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, has been one of the leading voices among lawmakers in favor of eliminating — or at least sharply reducing — the public benefits charge that pays for things such as energy efficiency programs, financial aid and investments in renewable energy that have been mandated by state lawmakers.
Fazio also criticized the costs of some of the renewable investments supported by customers as “obscenely expensive.”
“I think the evidence is there that it’s important to Connecticut residents and voters who are becoming increasingly wise to the fact that it’s actually elected officials in the state government who have been inflating the cost of the public benefits charge and electricity rates in general,” Fazio said. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Fazio proposed shifting the cost of the public benefits charge — currently around $1 billion a year — onto the state’s budget. When that effort failed to gain traction, Fazio worked with Democratic leaders and Lamont’s office on a compromise measure, Senate Bill 4, that ultimately passed with bipartisan support. The bill authorized officials to borrow up to $250 million over two years to pay off some of the public benefits charge.
Moving forward, Fazio said lawmakers should examine each of the programs in the public benefits charge to determine whether they should remain a charge to customers, be covered in the state budget or be ended entirely. That would include making decisions over whether to provide public funding for certain programs, such as the low-income discount rate, that are intended to help some customers pay their bills.
“Should we have more of this program, less of this program? That’s, I think, a conversation for the appropriations process,” Fazio said. “On its face, it is not something you just shove in the electricity bill.”

Stewart’s campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview on energy policy. In April, then-Mayor Stewart posted on X that she attended a signing ceremony for Trump’s executive order supporting the coal industry, where she said she met with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and talked about the state’s “affordable energy future.” Connecticut’s last coal plant, Bridgeport Harbor Station, closed down in 2021 and was partially demolished last year.
In another social media post, Stewart also criticized the bipartisan effort to borrow money to reduce the public benefits charge as “fake relief” because that money would have to be paid back, with interest, by taxpayers. She also called for an end to the public benefits charge and an increase in energy supply, without going into details.
While Lamont supported the bonds included in S.B. 4, he expressed skepticism of proposals for the state to pick up more of the public benefits tab, saying it would merely move around costs without achieving savings.
“Ratepayers and taxpayers are the same people,” Lamont said. “What you’ve really got to do is generate more electricity that will reduce the great spikes … that’s what really drives the cost.”

Lamont is also facing a primary challenge from state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a self-described progressive who has said he wants to push Democrats to adopt more left-wing stances.
“The governor wants to be seen as progressive, so he wants the top line to be ‘historic investment in renewable energy,’ and then at his very next breath, he says ‘historic investment in natural gas,'” Elliott said.
If elected, Elliott said that he would seek to finance the cost of building solar and other renewable energy projects through state bonds that are paid back by taxpayers instead of being tacked onto customers’ electric bills. He also said he would take a tougher approach toward the development of data centers than either Lamont or Fazio — both of whom said they would support such projects if the developers agreed to pay their share of the cost to build the electric infrastructure needed to run them.
Elliott said any power plants built for data centers should have to run off of renewable electricity, not natural gas or petroleum. He also questioned the economic benefit of large data centers, noting that they tend to employ relatively few people outside of the construction workers it takes to build them. 
“What looks like a boon to our economy ends up being something that, over the long run, is a really bad decision,” Elliott said.
Lori Brown, executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, criticized both Lamont and Republicans for embracing natural gas, which she pointed out is subject to volatile price spikes that can increase the cost of energy, particularly in the winter.
“In Connecticut, the narrative is just being driven as if clean energy is the reason for all the woes in in electric bills,” Brown said. “That’s just such a false narrative.”
Additionally, Brown and other environmental advocates argue that investing in clean energy helps avoid other long-term costs associated with climate change, such as damage from storms and health care costs for people with respiratory illnesses.
Both CTLCV and the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club endorsed Lamont during each of his previous two runs for governor. The split over the issue of gas pipeline expansions, however, could push those groups to withhold their endorsements or consider backing Elliott in the primary.
Steve Lewis, the chair of the Connecticut Sierra Club’s political committee, said the group has yet to meet to discuss endorsements but said the pipeline issue is “something we need to consider very seriously.”
In response, Lamont pointed to his administration’s support for solar and wind projects, as well as efforts to improve energy efficiency. He added that any projects to expand pipeline capacity would be subject to the “highest environmental standards,” and compared against other energy resources to determine which have the lowest costs. 
“You’re not serious about affordability if you’re not serious about an all-the-above strategy,” Lamont said.

Federal impact
In addition to their Connecticut-specific pitches, each of the the candidates for governor must also navigate the seismic — and at times unpredictable — shifts in federal energy policy being introduced by the Trump administration.
In October, the Trump administration ordered a sudden halt to work on a massive offshore wind farm, Revolution Wind, off the coast of Rhode Island. At the time, the project was nearly 80% completed and employed more than 100 workers at the State Pier in New London.
The move drew swift criticism from Lamont and other proponents of offshore wind, who predicted that the loss of Revolution Wind would increase the risk of blackouts while pushing additional supply costs onto electric customers. Eventually, a lawsuit by the project’s developer succeeded in getting work to resume.
Then, three days before Christmas, the Trump administration again ordered a pause for Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects under development.
Even Republicans such as Fazio and Stewart expressed some unease over Trump’s intervention in Revolution Wind, despite their criticisms of wind power.
“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish,” Stewart said in an interview with CT Mirror in December, prior to the administration’s second effort to halt the project.
Fazio has criticized the cost of the power purchase agreement Connecticut entered into with Revolution Wind’s developers, which he said is likely to result in additional charges on customers’ monthly electric bills. 
“On the other end, you know, the project is down the path,” Fazio said. “There’s a tradeoff there and I hope that the concerns that the federal government has, that the state and feds can communicate about [them] and work [them] out.”
Trump has also complicated ongoing efforts in Connecticut to utilize federal money to spur investments in climate-friendly programs. As part of a wide-ranging tax and spending bill passed last year, the federal government began phasing out tax incentives and other subsidies for electric vehicles, solar panels and energy efficiency upgrades that had been a centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s energy policy.
“It’s huge,” said Kaufman, the Columbia professor. “The whole premise of [Biden’s] Inflation Reduction Act and the subsidies for clean energy within that law was that the federal government was going to pick up the tab for a lot of investments in clean energy, or energy efficiency, or conservation actions.”
While the Trump administration and Congress have continued to support some investments in low- and zero-emission technologies, particularly nuclear, Kaufman said the changes in federal policy will generally force state officials to choose between picking up the cost of clean energy programs or discontinuing them.
“To keep moving forward, that means more of those costs are going to going to have to be incurred by Connecticut ratepayers and residents,” he added. “That’s a big deal… we’re just in a very different situation here than we were a few years ago.”
In Connecticut, Kaufman said officials could also look to trim some of the costs of clean energy programs — such as subsidies for rooftop solar or tradable credits for renewable energy — without imperiling the broader public push to adopt those technologies.
Last February, Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian energy imports, sparking confusion as to whether they would apply to electricity crossing the U.S.-Canadian border on transmission lines. New England imports about 11% of its electricity from Canada. 
A spokesperson for the regional grid operator, ISO New England, said in an email that the federal government has yet to levy tariffs on those imports, and that the additional duties announced by the administration are not believed to apply to electricity.
Meanwhile, the president’s promises to lower electricity costs by keeping open aging coal power plants is unlikely to have much of an impact in New England, where the only operating coal plant shut down in September.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The recent war of words between a prominent local Jewish leader and U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) over Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza is a reminder of how volatile the issue has become in American politics.
The punching and counter-punching between Van Hollen, who has become a leading congressional critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ron Halber, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington, brings the controversy home.
But this was hardly the only reminder that the Israel-Gaza war is a potent political issue in American politics – or that it is likely to become a factor in multiple Maryland elections in 2026 and beyond.
Several developments this year, large and small, abroad and at home, have brought the conflict in Gaza and its political fallout into sharp relief, with untold ramifications for state politics. These include:

The election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York;
A decision by the JCRC to bestow its inaugural Community Champion Award on a leading candidate for Montgomery County executive;
A vote by the University of Maryland student government – on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar – calling on the university to divest from companies and institutions with ties to Israel’s military;
A Jewish state senator suggesting a fellow Jewish Democrat hated Jews because he was advocating against government funding for an entity that seeks to build business partnerships between Maryland and Israel;
Ongoing criticism of Van Hollen by certain Maryland Jewish leaders;
The Trump administration negotiating a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza;
The deadly attack on Australian Jews celebrating Hanukkah at a beach resort

War of words over Israel heats up between Van Hollen and Halber

What it all adds up to, as a determinative political issue for 2026, is hard to say. But it’s hard to ignore the idea that the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and Americans’ reaction to it, could be very impactful in the midterm elections, even in Maryland.
Over the past six months, Maryland Matters interviewed close to 20 people about how Israel and Gaza could influence the 2026 elections here – elected officials and political strategists, civic and religious leaders, activists and academics. Pointedly, only a few agreed to be interviewed for the record – though a handful said they would consider putting some of their remarks on the record eventually.
The brutal Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, which killed at least 1,200 people, and the political violence and humanitarian catastrophe that has followed, resulting in a reported 70,000 Palestinian deaths, has created a pivot point in American politics.
But in a nation that has been pro-Israel for so long, no one can really say what we’re pivoting to. Multiple polls show public opinion shifting, on U.S. support for Israel, on Palestinian rights and on a host of adjacent issues.
This has caused a reckoning for Democrats and Republicans, and for Jewish voters themselves – and has revealed deep fissures within these and other segments of the electorate. In heavily blue Maryland, the impact of the war on Democratic voters may matter the most.
“In the Democratic Party, I think it’s going to be part of the conversation and part of the evaluation process of candidates,” said former Chevy Chase Town Councilmember Joel Rubin, who is also a former Obama administration official and one-time foreign policy adviser to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He writes frequently about Middle East affairs and Jewish-American politics.
Beyond federal elections
In congressional elections, foreign policy will of course be a topic of debate. But even in state and local elections next year, the crisis in the Middle East may carry an emotional wallop – and could help candidates distinguish themselves from one another. We saw that in the recent election for mayor of New York City.
In the year since President Donald Trump was reelected, Democrats have been cleaved by several divides – ideological and generational and tactical – even with their victories in November’s off-year elections. But it’s also apparent that the conflict in Gaza is another source of division and controversy among Democrats, every bit as important as the other internal debates.










In the Democratic Party, I think it’s going to be part of the conversation and part of the evaluation process of candidates.


– Former Chevy Chase Town Councilmember Joel Rubin, a former Obama administration official who writes frequently about Middle East affairs and Jewish-American politics.


“The U.S.-Israel relationship is definitely an issue that Democratic candidates use to differentiate themselves from other candidates,” said Tali deGroot, vice president of political and digital strategy at J Street, a liberal Jewish organization seeking a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
In some ways, at least among Democrats, the divide over Israel and Gaza has become a stand-in for other issues, or is being used as short-hand for voters to evaluate and discuss candidates’ overall perspectives.
“I think a lot of voters would like to see politicians have moral clarity on this issue,” deGroot said.
Rubin calls the debate part of a “values platform,” especially for progressive Democrats. And former state Del. Saqib Ali (D-Montgomery), who has been pressing Maryland Democrats for years to stake out pro-Palestinian positions and to criticize the current Israeli regime, said, “To me, it’s kind of a litmus test: What are your human rights values?”
But one voter’s idea of moral clarity on the Israel-Palestine divide is another’s misguided prejudice, and any statement on the conflict carries risks of misinterpretation and political attack. The world is full of social media warriors, and their weapons are especially sharp when discussing Israel and Gaza. There are broader issues of antisemitism and Islamophobia at work that transcend state and local politics.
Still, Gaza will resonate in Maryland next year.
Most obviously, it will be a factor in the congressional 5th District, if the dean of the Maryland delegation, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D), decides to retire in 2026 at the age of 87.
State, federal lawmakers vow to fight antisemitism at Rockville legislative event

An open-seat race should attract several Democratic contenders, and there will be a range of opinions on Israel and Gaza – some genuine, others pure political calculations. In the past two election cycles alone, a super PAC affiliated with the pro-Israel political powerhouse American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the United Democracy Project (UDP), has dropped more than $8 million into open congressional races in Maryland, according to Open Secrets, a website that tracks money in politics. That included $4.2 million to defeat ex-Rep. Donna Edwards (D) in the 2022 Democratic primary that now-Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) won; and another $4.2 million on behalf of now-Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) last year.
UDP did not respond to a request for comment this fall about its 2026 strategy, but it seems inconceivable that the PAC wouldn’t play in a race to replace Hoyer, either to aid a strong pro-Israel Democrat or to oppose a candidate that AIPAC deems insufficiently supportive. Hoyer has been a huge backer of Israel through his 44-year congressional career; one of the longshot Democrats seeking to unseat him, Harry Jarin, who is Jewish, has blasted the incumbent for his steadfast support of Netanyahu – suggesting the congressman’s stance is out of touch with most Democrats, especially younger voters.
Beyond federal races, there are other ways Gaza and Israel will come up next year. In state elections, and in Montgomery County, there could be questions about annual government contributions to the Maryland Israel Development Center, a public-private partnership that works to forge business ties between the state and Israel.
This year, the state government invested $225,000 in the MIDC, compared to $275,000 in recent fiscal years. Those allocations are set directly by the Maryland Department of Commerce, not by the governor or the legislature, but the executive or legislature could try to end that arrangement. The Montgomery County government set aside $47,000 for the center this year, as the Montgomery Perspective website first reported.
Although attempts in the legislature to strip the funding have so far gone nowhere, conversations about keeping that allocation intact can get heated. In November, when Montgomery County’s legislative delegation held an online hearing about priorities for the 2026 General Assembly session, Nathan Feldman, a former member of the county’s Democratic central committee, urged lawmakers to strip out the MIDC funding.
“The Jew-hate fest continues,” said Sen. Ben Kramer (D), the chair of the county’s Senate delegation, just before Feldman spoke.
Feldman is Jewish.
Fair game for any candidate
Throughout the state, even if the offices they are seeking have absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy, candidates may be asked about where they stand on Israel and Gaza and related issues – the vibey, morality questions that Rubin, deGroot, Ali and others who were interviewed for this article anticipate.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The issue will almost certainly be a factor in the county executive race in Montgomery County, where more than 40% of Maryland’s Jews live. Montgomery County voters are different from those in the rest of the state, given the county’s proximity to Washington, D.C., and their overall fixation on the federal government.
Already, County Councilmember Will Jawando, one of the three leading contenders in the Democratic primary for county executive, has expressed some trepidation about the MIDC funding. In a statement he provided to Montgomery Perspective in late September, he said he wanted to find out if the money is being used to develop weapons, calling continued financial support “a non-starter” if that turns out to be the case.
Earlier this year, Halber’s organization, one of the most prominent Jewish organizations in the Washington region, announced it was bestowing its inaugural Community Champion Award on Montgomery County Councilmember Andrew Friedson (D), a leading candidate for county executive next year. Although the JCRC does not endorse candidates for office or operate a political action committee, the award effectively felt like an attempt by the group to put its finger on the scale in the election.
“Since the day he took office, Councilmember Friedson has been a stalwart supporter of the Jewish community — from delivering much-needed security funding for synagogues and other Jewish community institutions to standing up against antisemitism,” Bob Budoff, president of the JCRC Board of Directors, said in a statement. “The Community Champion Award reflects Councilmember Friedson’s commitment to Jewish children and families and making Montgomery County a better place for everybody. We look forward to partnering with him for years to come.”
Coincidentally and tragically, the May 21 award ceremony, at a temple in Washington, D.C., took place on the same evening two Israeli embassy workers were gunned down in front of a Jewish museum across town.
Moments after those murders, Friedson and his two principal opponents for the Democratic nomination, Jawando and Councilmember Evan Glass, put out statements condemning the violence and the antisemitism that allegedly motivated the alleged attack.
Jewish voters are hardly a monolith in Montgomery County (or anywhere else). Like all county voters, Jewish voters in Maryland’s most populous county are divided by geography, age, overall ideology and income level – and that surely comes into play with their views on Israel.
Competing Oct. 7 events pass without incident on University of Maryland campus

And most Montgomery voters will still be swayed by the candidates’ positions on education, housing, transportation, public safety, economic development and taxes next year. But it doesn’t mean the Middle East won’t carry some import.
Which brings us back to Van Hollen, a giant figure in Montgomery County politics, with a 35-year record of electoral success.
Van Hollen has surprised and disappointed several of his allies by criticizing the Israeli government so vociferously for its military strikes in Gaza – even as he’s heartened others. He along, with Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th), say they want to curtail some funding for the Israeli military.
DeGroot, of J Street, hailed Van Hollen’s “strong moral leadership” on Gaza. Ali said Van Hollen’s stance epitomizes the evolution of public opinion among Democratic leaders and voters – and compared the rapid change of opinion on Israel to the public’s quick turnaround on supporting gay marriage several years ago.
“I used to feel like it was a stretch to convince [elected officials] to be on my side,” he said.
In private conversations over the past few months, several friends and admirers of Van Hollen’s have fretted that his public criticism of Israel could have consequences if he seeks reelection in 2028. In a withering op-ed in The Baltimore Sun this fall, former state Sen. Bobby Zirkin (D-Baltimore County) blasted Van Hollen for his criticism of Israel and for endorsing Mamdani in New York, and he accused them both of spreading Hamas propaganda.
Some Jewish allies have quietly suggested that Van Hollen’s political survival will be something of a reclamation project – or they express hope that passions over Israel and Gaza will have cooled by 2028.
Considering the progression of voters’ opinions on Israel, this seems like an antiquated view, and also a premature one: The 2026 election cycle is going to have more twists and turns than anyone can anticipate, and Israel and Gaza will be part of the political narrative. 2028 is a lifetime away.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UMD-SJP-10-7-2024-1024x639.jpg,,,2026-01-02 04:57:28.620574

(Eric Thomas)Most coverage of the Kansas City Chiefs’ new stadium on the Kansas side of the state line has sensibly focused on either the competition between Kansas and Missouri or the related financing of the stadium with public funds. Those concerns matter most politically and fiscally. 
The transition from an outdoor venue at Arrowhead Stadium to a domed stadium has attracted less attention. When people have written about the dome of it all, they have spotlighted the likelihood that a Super Bowl might come to Kansas City. 
After all, cold-weather cities risk brutal game conditions during February for the NFL’s marquee game. Recent Super Bowl host cities illustrate the point: New Orleans, Las Vegas, Arizona, Los Angeles, Tampa, Miami and Atlanta. The most recent cold-weather city? Minneapolis with its U.S. Bank Stadium hosted in 2018. 
But the Super Bowl is just one game. How will a domed stadium change games at the most vital stadium in our state and region? 
Let’s stick with the weather for a moment. The NFL preseason begins in early August, meaning that players and fans can swelter, with temperatures routinely reaching the mid-90s. Expect that to only get worse with climate change. A dome would help (if only through air conditioning that further imperils the environment).
Hermetically, sealed stadiums offer more certainty of a pleasant game. But that doesn’t mean that they deliver dramatic contests. 
Consider the Chiefs’ frigid playoff win against the Miami Dolphins in 2024. Temperatures dipped so low that quarterback Patrick Mahomes shattered his helmet on a run near the goal line, producing an iconic photo and a memorable game. 
The cost of gathering people on such a tundra became clear in the following weeks, when local hospitals reported that they performed several amputation surgeries on frostbitten fans. You could use that example to argue for a domed stadium, but the game could have been postponed or relocated. 
The Chiefs’ new stadium, scheduled to open in 2031, will certainly be the most important in the heartland. The next closest major domed stadium is in St. Louis: The Dome at America’s Center. Ask St. Louis locals, and they will tell you how the dome has descended into disrepair and languor since the Rams left for California. The venue’s schedule of upcoming events is cautionary and lackluster indeed: a Monster Jam truck show this month followed by truck, RV and auto shows. 
The next closest domed stadiums are hefty drives: the retractable-roof stadium of the Dallas Cowboys, plus domes in Indianapolis and Minneapolis. With each of those locations seven hours away by car, the new Chiefs stadium should become a destination for mega-concerts and more. 
Let’s hope that the best parts of Arrowhead Stadium aren’t lost with the move to a dome. Many of my best Chiefs memories come from the tailgate culture of the parking lot — a mix of smoked meats, light beers and elaborately retrofitted school buses. I never thought I would ask for a new sprawling parking lot, especially one that cozies up to the stadium. But the concrete savannah of Arrowhead makes games more fun. 
Following the announcement of the Chiefs’ move to Kansas, I photographed the team’s loss to the Denver Broncos at field level for Getty Images. Even with a crowd diminished by the team’s losing record, the stadium was still loud. That volume is another Arrowhead signature. 
If you are wondering about Kansas City’s status as the loudest place to play, a dome might tilt things a bit. Perhaps the building plans will call for noise reduction to ensure that trapped crowd sound in the dome doesn’t become uncomfortable. Or perhaps the new dome will be even louder than the Chiefs’ record for an outdoor stadium: 142.2 decibels, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. 
As Kansans, our central worry in building should be longevity — because few stadiums are as gray and miserable as old domes. If you visited the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis before it was pushed aside for the Colts’ new home, you know what I mean. The echo of the music and announcements could make you queasy, not to mention the intense air pressure that would essentially suck you into the revolving doors. 
An aging dome is the worst kind — it sends a team looking for a new stadium in a new city. 
Can the Chiefs build a dome that lasts as long as Arrowhead? The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans suggests so. Built in 1975, the stadium hosted the most recent Super Bowl. (Although, as someone who attended the game, I can testify that the Superdome shows its age, especially in bathroom concourse areas.)
If you are already nostalgic for Arrowhead, there’s good news. The move won’t come for a handful of seasons, so plan your trip to Missouri. 
And be sure to pack the right wardrobe for both the tailgate and the game.

With the win, the Rebels (13-1) punched their ticket to the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, where they’ll face Miami in the Fiesta Bowl next Thursday in Tempe, Arizona.
And if that round goes anything like the second one did, the Magnolia State may have to invest in more respirators.
Down 9 points at the half, the Rebels scored back-to-back touchdowns to open the fourth quarter and held off a fierce Georgia rally.
Chambliss was the star — the senior passed for 362 yards and two touchdowns — but there were no shortages of heroic performances.
Despite coming in as a six-point underdog Ole Miss out-gained Georgia 473 yards to 343, and won despite several bad breaks.

Georgia’s splendid quarterback Gunner Stockton responded with scoring runs to cap back-to-back 75-yard touchdown drives and put Georgia ahead 14-12.
Ole Miss was driving to take the lead back before the halftime break, but Georgia defender Daylen Everette scooped up a rare fumble from Ole Miss tailback Kewan Lacy and raced 47 yards to extend the Georgia lead to 21-12.

“We definitely didn’t play our cleanest football in the first half on either side of the ball,” Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said. “I kind of challenged them at halftime and said, you know, look, we were up nine on these guys going into the fourth quarter last time. Let’s play 30 minutes of football and out-physical them and execute. They just responded like they have all year.”
The Rebels traded a touchdown — a fumble-redeeming seven-yard bruising run for Lacy — for a Georgia field goal in the third quarter to trim the Bulldogs’ lead to 24-19.

That’s when the real fun started.
Lacy’s second touchdown came on a five-yard run and put Ole Miss ahead 27-24 with 11:29 to go.
Georgia coach Kirby Smart rolled the dice on the Bulldogs’ ensuing possession, opting to try to convert a 4th-and-2 situation at the Georgia 33-yard line.
Stockton rolled to his right looking for a receiver downfield, but didn’t see Ole Miss defender Suntarine Perkins coming from his blind side. Perkins drilled Stockton for a sack, forcing a fumble which he recovered at the Bulldogs’ 23-yard line.

“We knew that was going to be a big play in the game,” Ole Miss defensive MVP Will Echoles said. “I’m not going to say I was surprised, but Perkins made a great play.”
The turnover set Ole Miss up with a short field, and Chambliss cashed it in two plays later with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Harrison Wallace to put Ole Miss ahead 34-24 with nine minutes left.
But the Bulldogs had a response of their own: a seven-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that trimmed the Ole Miss lead down to three, at 34-31 with 7:03 to go. They tied the game with 56 seconds left on a 24-yard Peyton Woodring field goal.
Luckily, Chambliss had a little magic left in his back pocket.

Facing a third-and-five at his own 30, the senior found receiver De’Zhaun Stribling streaking down the home sideline for a 40-yard completion that gave the Rebels a new set of downs at the Georgia 30.
Two plays later, Ole Miss’ splendid kicker Lucas Carniero drilled a 47-yard field goal to regain the lead, 37-34, with just six seconds left.
Georgia tried a trick play on the ensuing kickoff and lateraled the ball out of bounds on their own goal-line, giving Ole Miss two points for a safety and extending the lead to 39-34.

Georgia got the ball back on an onside kick, but a final play that featured 11 laterals ended with a 12-yard loss and Ole Miss storming the field.
It was a strange, almost surreal ending to a marvelously competitive game.
“It was an incredible college football game,” Smart said. “It’s what the college football playoff was built for, to have battles like that.”

(Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission)In Florida, the environmental beat during 2025 featured land purchases and development rights, which tied in to immigration efforts, plus the first bear hunt in a decade and a big electric utility rate increase. 
Bear hunt reopens
Fifty-two black bears were “harvested” during the 2025 Florida black bear hunt, the first of its kind in a decade, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced this week.
Members of the FWC  agreed earlier this year to allow hunters to kill 172 black bears within four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 31 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in a South hunting area.
Bear Warriors United tried unsuccessfully to shut down the 23-day hunt, arguing that the FWC relied on outdated data and that the hunt was politically motivated; agency staff had not initially recommended a hunt during a December 2024 presentation about its Florida Black Bear Management Plan.
But Leon County Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey denied the organization’s request for an injunction.

Hunters were allowed to kill bears at game feeding stations, using food to bait the animals. And in 2027 hunters will be allowed use to use dogs to assist them in the hunt.
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050. The 2025 hunt was the first since 2015, when the state shut down that hunt at the end of its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
Legislature bans building in state parks
In 2024, the DeSantis administration proposed building lodges, pickleball courts, golf courses, and other facilities to state parks. In 2025, he signed a bill to outlaw doing any such things in the parks. 
To block another golf course debacle, Florida lawmakers try protecting state parks

What came in between those two events was widespread, bipartisan pushback and protest against the idea of building inside of the state’s natural destinations. 
Earlier this year, lawmakers unanimously supported the State Park Preservation Act. Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman, a Republican from Highland Beach, said she received more than 1,500 emails from members of the public following the initial development plan. 
The law now requires more transparent notification of meetings; in 2024, the state tried to quietly advance the development proposals. Originally, the state gave the public six days’ warning before simultaneous meetings across the state to discuss the proposals. Those meetings were rescheduled amid widespread public concern.
The 2024 proposal was one of the Phoenix’s Top 10 political developments of that year. 
Although the DeSantis administration had pushed for development, the governor claimed — after the public pushback — that he’d never seen the proposal. However, DeSantis’ public schedule showed that earlier that year he’d met with the organization involved in the plans. 
The state employee who leaked the proposal was fired. 
In 2011, former Gov. Rick Scott had attempted to put golf courses in state parks, but after pushback then, too, it was scrapped.

Guana River land swap
It started out quietly but opposition grew quickly and got loud.
The Upland LLC in May pitched the idea of a land swap in an application to the Acquisition and Restoration Council (ARC), a state panel that, among other things, evaluates, selects, and ranks state land acquisition projects and evaluates proposed uses of state-owned conservation land.
The state would exchange roughly 600 acres in the Guana River Wildlife Management Area in St. Johns County to the developer. In return, the state would get more than 3,000 acres of land across four parcels scattered across Lafayette, Volusia, Osceola, and St. Johns counties.
Horses riding on trails in Guana River WMA via FWC
The state parcel, managed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, includes a pedestrian trail and is accessible to the public for waterfowl hunting, fishing, paddling, and wildlife viewing. It contains flatwoods, salt and freshwater marshes, wet flatwoods, wet and dry hammock, and scrub. Threatened gopher tortoises and Eastern indigo snakes inhabit the area, according to the application. 
The land swap, agreed to by the FWC, was quickly included on the May 21 ARC meeting agenda. That gave the public just one week’s notice to oppose the proposal.
But it was enough.
Conservation and environmental groups swung into action and St. Johns County residents who opposed the deal circulated a petition. The proposal transcended local politics though, with state and even national leaders coming out against it.
“Guana Preserve and its beauty, familiarity and serenity is woven into the fabric of our communities and is, indeed, a treasure in northeast Florida. To allow — even enable — this land grab to occur is outrageous and completely contrary to what our community desires. Elected and appointed leaders should vote against this development wolf in sheep’s clothing and preserve this extraordinary natural bounty,” President Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told The Tributary. 
Florida Republican U.S. and gubernatorial hopeful Byron Donalds posted on X, “I stand with the residents of St. Johns County: Guana Preserve is NOT for sale.”

As a member of Florida’s Congressional delegation, I believe this is a bad deal for Florida and should be VOTED DOWN. https://t.co/rRvWbmZsdV

One day before the ARC meeting, Upland pulled its proposal from the agenda.
Gov. Ron DeSantis denied any personal role in the proposed land swap.
FPL rate increases
The public community came in high in February, asking for a near-$10 billion rate increase for its customers over the next four years. Critics argue that Florida Power & Light also settled high, getting approval in November from Public Service Commission members to increase rates by about $6.9 billion.
Opponents claim it’s the largest utility rate hike in U.S. history.
FPL is the state’s largest utility with approximately six million accounts and about 12 million customers. FPL’s parent company, NextEra Energy, is Florida-based and publicly traded. 
The five-member PSC holds regulatory authority over rates charged for electric, natural gas, telephone, water, and wastewater. The governor appoints PSC members from a list of candidates recommended by the Public Service Commission Nominating Council.
The months-long debate over the proposed rate hikes could impel the Legislature to change how the PSC operates. Crestview Republican Sen. Don Gaetz pushed for changes during the 2025 session, filing SB 354, but found no support in the House.
Not dissuaded, Gaetz in October filed SB 126, which already has been approved by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government.
Building back better banned under SB 180
Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie says the goal of 2025’s SB 180 was to streamline restoration and improve emergency response coordination following major hurricanes.
But the controversial legislation is the subject of two lawsuits.
Twenty-five local governments have filed in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County, arguing the new law unconstitutionally infringes on their authority to govern their day-to-day operations.
The second suit was filed by 1000 Friends of Florida and east Orange County resident Rachel Hildebrand, also in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County.
Legislature wants to make it impossible for local governments to build back better after hurricanes

Specifically, SB 180 retroactively prevents cities and counties listed in federal disaster declarations for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton from adopting tougher development rules until October 2027. 
The ban could extend beyond 2027, though. Another section of the law allows a similar one-year ban to take effect anytime a local government is listed in a federal disaster declaration and lies within 100 miles of a hurricane’s path.
Signed into law by Gov Ron DeSantis on June 30, SB 180 gives “any person” standing to sue a local government’s amendment, regulation, or development order and, if successful, to receive their attorney fees.
Local governments have 14 days to repeal any restriction that draws a legal challenge. If a municipality declines, the lawsuit can be filed.
DeSantis defended the legislation, telling reporters over the summer that it gives homeowners battered by hurricanes the ability to rebuild their homes according to pre-storm building codes.
“They want to go out and restore their home to what it was like before the storm hits, and the local governments are telling them, ‘You can’t do it. You gotta do something else,’” DeSantis said. “What right do they have to tell you that you can’t rebuild your home? This isn’t California. This is Florida.”
Destin land purchase
A piece of land in Destin made headlines this year after the state paid the landowner, a political donor, 10 times more for it than the owner purchased it for nearly 10 years ago. 
Campaign contributor skips line, gets big payday from Florida governor and Cabinet

In September, the governor and Cabinet voted to purchase about four acres in Destin without a state-sponsored assessment. Instead, they relied on an appraisal conducted by the seller. 
The previous landowner purchased the land for about $8 million in 2016 and 2017. The governor and Cabinet purchased it from the landowner for more than $80 million. 
The land was previously owned by two LLCs, operated by a Louisiana businessman with a history of contributing to Florida politicians, including those locally in Destin. 
The Legislature, in a last-second budget proposal, made room for the deal. The language lawmakers approved allowed the state to create a park in Okaloosa County without requiring an appraisal.
Legislative Democrats, in announcing their 2026 session agenda, included a bill asking the state to investigate the deal. 
Everglades restoration
This year, the state completed a reservoir on the Caloosahatchee River, a key prevention measure against toxic algae blooms. The project represented a major milestone in Everglades restoration, something the state has focused on for decades. 
The state budget for the current fiscal year, DeSantis’ second-to-last before term limiting out of office, provides $1.3 billion for protection and restoration in the Everglades, a major increase from the previous year. Of that, approximately $800 million is for restoration.
DeSantis asked President Donald Trump early in the year for permission to finish the long-going Everglades restoration project by itself, maintaining federal funding through block grants.

In July, DeSantis’ administration signed an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to accelerate restoration efforts. His office says the agreement will accelerate the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir construction timeline by five years, putting its completion date in 2029.
Those are some of the bright points of 2025 when it comes to the Florida Everglades.
But when the state opened a 3,000-bed immigrant holding facility in the Everglades, environmental groups, worried that state may not have followed federal environmental regulations and concerned that the project could harm the unique ecosystem, sued the state.
The Everglades facility, built of tents and temporary infrastructure, has been the subject of political debate, the Democrats decrying it and the GOP fundraising off of it. 
It was built at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, advertised with the promise of using wild alligators as a deterrent to escape.
A judge called for the facility to close by the time September ended, but a federal appellate panel reversed that.
“He can’t claim to be the Everglades governor on one hand, and then plunk down this mass facility in the heart of the Everglades on the other hand,” attorney Tania Galloni, representing Friends of the Everglades, said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix earlier this year.

It is urgent.","Alzheimer’s disease is not a distant crisis. It is a present, accelerating public health emergency – one that touches families in every city and town in Connecticut.
Yet despite its scale and its profound human impact, Alzheimer’s still does not receive the coordinated attention, funding, or urgency that other major health threats demand. That’s why Alzheimer’s advocacy has never been more important than it is right now.
More than 80,000 Connecticut residents live with Alzheimer’s or another dementia. Behind every diagnosis is a family navigating fear, role changes, and the overwhelming responsibility of providing care. Unpaid caregivers in our state contribute nearly 100 million hours of care annually, often while juggling full-time jobs, raising children, or managing their own health concerns. The emotional and financial strain is immense — and often invisible.
Yet a deeper challenge is quietly growing beneath the surface: the demographic shift accelerating the crisis.  By 2030, one in five Americans will be over the age of 65. Connecticut is already one of the oldest states in the nation, meaning we will feel the impact of this aging wave earlier and more intensely than most. The need for a strong, dementia-capable public health infrastructure is not theoretical. It is urgent.
The encouraging news is that meaningful solutions do exist – and advocacy is how those solutions become reality.
Recent federal legislation such as the BOLD Act and the Alzheimer’s Accountability and Investment Act has transformed the national response to dementia by strengthening public health systems, supporting Centers of Excellence, and — critically — requiring the National Institutes of Health to clearly outline the annual funding needed to achieve the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Plan. That accountability requirement matters. It ensures that Alzheimer’s research and care receive stable, transparent investment rather than slipping to the margins of federal priorities.
Connecticut is also stepping up. In 2025, the state passed legislation that will require all state-regulated health insurance plans to cover biomarker testing— including for conditions like Alzheimer’s — starting January 1, 2026. This coverage improvement will help democratize access to advanced diagnostics and accelerate earlier detection and treatment — a major win for families who have historically faced disparities in access to care.


And these legislative wins didn’t happen by accident. They happened because ordinary people — caregivers, community members, and advocates — raised their voices. They wrote letters, called their representatives, shared their stories, and refused to let Alzheimer’s be ignored. 
I’ve seen firsthand how powerful advocacy can be. Years ago, while serving as an Ambassador to Rep. John Larson through the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement, I wrote to his office encouraging him to support the BOLD Act shortly after it was introduced. Within days, his district office called to say he would co-sponsor. That legislation is now law, and its Centers of Excellence are shaping how states – including Connecticut – respond to Alzheimer’s. It is living proof that individual advocacy can influence national policy.
But our work is far from finished. New treatments are emerging, yet access remains uneven. Early detection tools are improving, but most people are still diagnosed far too late. Caregivers continue to bear an unsustainable load without adequate support. And health equity gaps persist, especially in communities of color that face both higher risk and lower access to diagnostic care.
Alzheimer’s takes memories, independence, and time — but it should not take hope. Advocacy is how we preserve that hope. It ensures that families are not left to navigate dementia alone, that science continues to advance, and that government meets the scale of the challenge with urgency and compassion.
We cannot afford to wait for the crisis to deepen. The moment for action is now –and every voice matters.

They know that voters are fed up with their unpopular agenda, which is hurting the working class, raising our costs and weakening protections for workers across Maryland and the country.

Sensing the inevitability of voters running them from office next November, these politicians have turned to gerrymandering in an attempt to rig the elections and silence the will of the voters. Maryland has the chance to fight back and ensure fair representation in Congress by redrawing our maps to better represent this state’s communities and interests at the federal level.
Maryland voters have made it clear that they want Annapolis to fight for them, fight back against this administration and their state-government cronies, and help deliver a Congress that puts the interests of working families first. If we fail to protect the voices of voters and communities across our state in the face of these unprecedented acts in Republican-led states, we risk untold damage to Maryland communities from a government that will not represent us.
Our state has already been rocked by the actions of the current Congress and administration. Federal workers have been fired or left without pay for weeks during the prolonged shutdown. Our communities have been denied disaster aid, our infrastructure projects have had their funding threatened, and other projects critical to our communities have seen their funding cut completely. The only way that Maryland can stand up for ourselves and our interests is through our votes.
Next November, we can head to the ballot box and bring an end to the unchecked, callous actions of Republicans in Washington. But it will be for naught if we cannot overcome the machinations of Texas, Florida and the like.
Maryland voters recognize that unfair elections elsewhere undermine their power as voters. We must protect that power by putting Maryland at the forefront of the fight for our democracy and for fair representation in Congress. Failing to respond to Republican attacks on our elections is tantamount to surrender, and as this week’s polling demonstrates, there will almost certainly be electoral consequences for surrendering.
Maryland’s working families have had enough of Republican attacks on our democracy.

(Photo courtesy of Delicias del Pan’s Facebook page)Kneading dough and baking bread is an art that requires patience, skill, and time to master, according to Leidy Cristancho. A Colombian entrepreneur, Cristancho recently ventured into the bakery business alongside her husband, Luis Moreno Peña, with Delicias del Pan, in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
In 2019, the couple and their children left Bogotá and moved to California to build a new life. Two years later, they packed their belongings and drove to Iowa, where they had family connections and a supportive Colombian community waiting for them.
Like many immigrants with limited or no English skills, they took whatever jobs were available. Moreno Peña worked long hours as a cook at a burger chain, and Cristancho spent her days stocking shelves at a supermarket.
The long shifts came at a heavy price — physical exhaustion, mental stress, and strain on their marriage. Eventually, they reached a breaking point. Something had to change.
When faced with the demands of a grueling 14-hour workday, Cristancho knew it was time to explore options. “I’m tired and fed up. Tell me what you want to do, and I’ll take care of the rest,” she told her husband, her swollen feet aching from endless hours on the supermarket floor. She knew Moreno Peña, who came from a family of bakers in Colombia, was also eager for change. He had the talent but not the time.
Launching a Colombian bakery in Council Bluffs
Despite knowing nothing about dough or how to mix butter and eggs, Cristancho marched into the Latino Market in Council Bluffs, ready to sell Colombian buñuelos and bread.
“It was tough. We needed permits for everything. Don Saúl from the market was kind enough to let us sell there, but at first, nobody wanted to try our bread,” Cristancho recalls. “He started offering discounts, and that’s when people began to show interest.”
Competing against well-established bakeries hasn’t been easy. “We visited other Hispanic bakeries, like La Internacional, to understand their flavors. But their bread isn’t like Colombian bread. People are very attached to their traditions and sometimes don’t want to try new things,” she explains.
When they spotted an upcoming event on social media, they seized the opportunity. Cristancho came up with an idea to make their products more approachable: curated boxes filled with a variety of baked goods. They sold over 60 boxes and made $1,500 in just a few hours. It was their first taste of success — and they were hooked.
Learning the ropes of running a bakery

Beyond learning English, Cristancho, the creative force behind Delicias del Pan, faced the harsh reality of massive losses in both products and money. As any entrepreneur knows, the first years of a business are often the hardest.
Determined to succeed, Cristancho sought help from La Fuente’s Women Entrepreneurs Program. There, she got a crash course in everything it takes to run a business: crafting a business plan, managing finances, bookkeeping, marketing, taxes, permits, and more.
Through the program, they found a shared commercial kitchen at the Hoff Family Arts & Culture Center in Council Bluffs, where Cristancho rolls up her sleeves, handles dough, mans the ovens, and learns the art of patience — whether she likes it or not.
Moreno Peña may be the baker, but Cristancho is the boss. She manages operations, builds relationships, and creates opportunities to keep their business thriving. “I’m the one who solves the chicharrones (problems),” she says with a laugh, borrowing a Colombian expression.
A Colombian bakery’s impact in Iowa
Today, Cristancho feels pride in her role. Where once she viewed baking as her husband’s dream, she is now the heart of the business. Her days are no longer defined by exhausting shifts working for someone else, but by crafting pastries that tell a story — croissants that whisper of Colombia, cakes that bridge continents, each creation carefully tailored to their community’s evolving tastes.
Beyond bread, they’re carving out space for South American-style deliciousness, baked treats that are a bit more savory with a hint of sweetness. They use high-quality ingredients, avoid shortcuts, and aim to bring the flavors of their homeland to their community. Their commitment to quality is paying off. In October 2025, they were selected as one of the spotlight businesses for the 2025 REV Event, a small business pitch competition organized by TS Bank and Advance Southwest Iowa Corporation.
Cristancho’s journey goes beyond being a jefa (mom/boss) for her family and her growing business. She embodies the ingenuity of immigrants who find opportunities amid struggle and pull together to thrive.
Her goal? To win over the palates and hearts of anyone who bites into one of her creations at Delicias del Pan. If her story thus far is any indication, she’s well on her way.

In 2026, reSET wants to see Connecticut companies — from startups to established corporations — recognize that doing business for social impact is good economics. reSET entrepreneurs prove this daily: Businesses solving food insecurity, creating accessible retail opportunities, and building inclusive supply chains generate revenue while strengthening the entire economic ecosystem.
When businesses center social impact in their missions and daily operations, they invite innovation that builds wealth in underresourced communities, develop more sustainable products, foster customer loyalty transcending price competition, and intersect across sectors to create lasting positive change. In an increasingly values-driven marketplace, Connecticut businesses can stand out with this approach.
Since 2013 reSET has helped over 500 entrepreneurs launch and grow with impact, creating over 450 jobs, raising over $19 million in funding and generating over $30 million in revenue. Connecticut’s economy grows stronger when businesses measure success not just in quarterly earnings, but in community wealth creation, environmental sustainability and equitable opportunity.
In 2026, we challenge Connecticut’s business community to ask: What social challenge can our business help solve? That shift in mindset toward profit through purpose will define our state’s economic resilience and competitive edge for decades to come.
Antoinette Brim-Bell, Connecticut’s State Poet Laureate

My answer is not so much a change, but perhaps a deepening commitment to the installation of additional municipal poet laureates. Municipal poet laureates are literary advocates tasked with making poetry more accessible to their communities through readings, writing workshops and craft lectures. They curate voices whose lived experiences offer comfort, encourage empathy, learning and collaboration, thus bolstering community pride and engagement. 
Often, laureates collaborate with public libraries, educational institutions, and historical societies, using the literary arts to enhance understanding of history, science, and communication. Types of programming and collaborations in Connecticut have included ekphrastic exhibits, poetry inspired by visual art, where the poetry is shown alongside the paintings; Vietnam veterans writing about their wartime experiences; grade-schoolers sharing their immigration stories; elders embarking on poetic journeys of memory; intergenerational writing workshops where parents, grandparents and children share musings and meditations; and writing workshops hosted by historical sites and museums that provide historical context and inspire writers of all levels. 
The beauty of the municipal poet laureate is that they are of that community, a present resource. Additionally, the collaboration between municipal poet laureates and the state poet laureate ensures that Connecticut remains culturally rich with a confluence of poetic voices.

In 2026 my primary wish is for us to work toward ONE Connecticut.
Second, I want a transparent government that embraces integrity, honesty and the good will of all Connecticut residents. 2025 brought countless investigative stories exposing several levels of corruption within the current administration. Corruption has no place in government of the people, by the people and for the people because it undermines the people’s trust. We need leadership that commands integrity and holds those accountable who falter.
Third, I would like to see legislation signed into law be enforced. For laws to impact unscrupulous behavior, enforcement is crucial. Absence of enforcement indicates a lack of respect for the law, a breeding ground for violations.
Fourth, I would like to see mandated reporting include a mandated plan of action for alleviating the issue. Far too many show little to no improvement in the conditions they report. From year to year, conditions remain constant or worsen. In the end one must question: Is that a good return on investments of millions of dollars?
Last, we need an end to bureaucracy that suffocates the life out of change.
Tessa Hallinan, Connecticut’s Kid Governor



I chose inclusion for kids with disabilities as my platform for running for Connecticut’s Kid Governor because I have many relatives who have disabilities. My cousin has dyslexia, my step-cousin is teased because he is a cancer survivor and has to wear bags around his waist, and my step-cousin has autism. 
In 2026, I plan to work on my three point plan which includes sharing videos on my web page about including, accepting and understanding kids with disabilities; inviting schools to start buddy systems that pairs fifth grade leaders with kids with disabilities; and encouraging schools to designate a “Buddy Lunch Table” in the cafeteria where students can sit if they feel left out or need a friend.
Steven Hernández, Connecticut Coalition for Achievement Now



In 2026, Connecticut has to treat student achievement like the defining work of our public education system, not one priority among many. Too many children are moving through school without mastering reading and math, particularly children of color and those living in poverty, and we all know what that means: fewer doors open later, and fewer chances to build the life they deserve. We cannot normalize that.
The path forward is not mysterious. First, we should deliver on the early literacy commitments already made and match that same level of seriousness in math, starting early. Early numeracy is not just another subject. It is how children learn patterns, logic and problem solving, the building blocks that unlock confidence and future potential in a changing economy and emerging careers. Connecticut should extend strong instruction and supports in reading and math into the upper elementary and middle grades, not wait for failure to show up in algebra. Second, we should make high-impact tutoring in reading and math a reliable part of the school day for students who fall behind, with clear statewide standards and sustained funding, not short-term pilots.
Finally, families need a system they can actually use. That means language access built in from the start, real public options held to the same expectation of results, and investing in the educators who carry this work, especially in high-need schools.
If we act with urgency and align around what works, 2026 can be a turning point for students and for Connecticut.

Next year, I want more young people to feel they can build their future in Connecticut. We’re making it easier to create housing, expanding universal childcare, investing in our colleges and universities, rebuilding our cities, and maintaining the best K–12 schools in the country. Still, many young people feel left behind. I want them starting families here, buying homes, launching businesses, and knowing they can truly thrive. Together, we can keep building the most family-friendly state in the nation and ensure every child has the chance to learn, grow and succeed.
The earliest years of education are especially critical. Parents across Connecticut often tell me their child’s success began with strong early learning and the dedicated teachers who made it possible. That’s why expanding childcare and early education for every family, regardless of income or ZIP code, remains a top priority. In January 2026, Connecticut will add 1,000 new Early Start CT spaces to increase access to affordable, high-quality early childhood care. It’s real progress, and only the beginning.
Finally, the past year has shown the importance of lowering the temperature of our public discourse and treating one another with respect. Connecticut has avoided many of the divisions seen elsewhere, and that tone must continue with elected officials, me included, as we embrace positive change.
Ben Proto, Connecticut Republican Party

As chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party, the obvious answer is new, dynamic leadership for Connecticut: a Republican Governor, more Republican members of the General Assembly and Republicans holding statewide and federal offices.
However, to achieve that change, we need a Connecticut Republican Party that is focused, disciplined, and relentlessly committed to winning.
Republicans must put results ahead of ego, teamwork ahead of self-promotion, and winning ahead of personal squabbles. Republicans cannot afford internal distractions. Every ounce of our energy must be directed toward earning the trust of families who feel squeezed by the high taxes, unaffordable housing, rising energy costs and a state government that too often seems disconnected from their daily lives.
We must speak clearly and honestly. Our voice must be strong, authentic and without apology. We need a united Republican Party that recognizes we are judged not only by our actions but also by our ability to lead Connecticut.
If we stay focused and work together, 2026 can be the year we begin to restore to Connecticut what is so desperately needed: balance, accountability and common sense to Connecticut government.
A strong two-party system is the change Connecticut needs in 2026.
Bill Shufelt and John Walker, Athletic Brewing Co.



One thing we’d love to see in 2026 is Connecticut fully embracing and promoting everything that already makes it special. Connecticut is not only an outstanding travel destination, but also a place where people can lay down roots, start families and build lasting businesses.
Connecticut is widely regarded as the pizza capital of the U.S., earning national praise year after year, but the story doesn’t stop at thin-crust pies. From Gioia in New Haven and Community Table in New Preston, to Bar Bouchée in Madison, The Whelk in Westport, and Fresh Salt in Old Saybrook, the dining scene is exceptional, with local products — including Athletic — proudly on the menu. That quality was recently recognized when Athletic received the 2025 CRAZIES Vendor of the Year award from the Connecticut Restaurant Association.
Beyond food and drink, Connecticut offers incredible beaches, trails and outdoor spaces that make it a unique place to visit and live. Through our Two For The Trails environmental grant program, we’re proud to help support and protect many of these natural destinations. Connecticut is also an excellent place to launch your startup. With a strong talent pool, a supportive business climate, and partners like Connecticut Innovations, we’ve seen firsthand how the state can help entrepreneurs bring their ideas to life and turn them into enduring businesses.

A Gallatin County District Court judge ruled that the Montana Department of Environmental Quality didn’t take a “hard look” at the water quality impacts of a proposed subdivision a quarter mile from the Gallatin River.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper filed a lawsuit against DEQ in 2023, arguing a project at an old quarry to build eight high-density housing buildings could harm an already impaired river.
The lawsuit focused on the development’s septic system permits and the state approval process for the build.
“DEQ has consistently failed to evaluate what’s happening in a river as a whole with many sources of nutrient pollution and seems to find individual new sources insignificant,” Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “But it never goes and looks at the system as a whole.
“And so when the agency doesn’t look at the system as a whole, you can’t render an evidence-based decision on whether or not something is going to cause harm. And that’s the penultimate question that not only the Water Quality Act, but the Montana Constitution requires.”
The project was approved in 2022, the same year the Environmental Protection Agency declared the Gallatin River to be “impaired,” due to an increased number of algae blooms and other contributing factors.
The blooms harm fish and plant life and are a growing problem and concern for environmental groups, anglers and those enjoying other outdoor water recreation activities. The Gallatin River has seen an increasing number of algae blooms, which the state has investigated.
The court ruling said DEQ’s failure to assess cumulative impacts of the project, and approval of the permit despite not knowing the cause of algal blooms, was “arbitrary, capricious and unlawful and in violation of the Montana Constitution, (Montana Environmental Policy Act) and the (Water Quality Act).”
DEQ generally does not comment on litigation, a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email on Wednesday afternoon.
In the decision issued on Dec. 29, the court did rule in favor of DEQ on two claims. It said the agency did not violate administrative procedures or otherwise constitute unlawful rulemaking. 
Additionally, the court said the DEQ did not violate the Montana Water Quality Act’s nondegradation policy, meant to protect the state’s natural resources. In this case, the court did not reach a conclusion about whether there had been violation of the policy because any potential pollution hasn’t happened yet.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper called the decision a major win. Other litigation pending, from Citizens for a Better Flathead, in the Flathead Valley, the Lakeside Sewer and Water case, still has a claim out regarding the “hard look” mentioned in the Quarry subdivision, which found that scrutiny is required in all cases.
“This decision reinforces that Montana law requires transparency, sound science, and accountability before approving new sources of pollution,” a press release from the organization stated. “If Phase 1 of the Quarry Project is to move forward, DEQ must redo its review and meaningfully analyze cumulative nutrient impacts on the Gallatin.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) SLATER — In a snow-covered field north of Des Moines, Lee Tesdell’s sheep seem comfortable, grazing in a paddock of Kernza, a perennial grain cultivated by The Land Institute in Kansas. 
Tesdell is one of just two farmers in Iowa that grow the deep-rooted grain that boasts low inputs, nutritional grain and roots that are highly effective at absorbing nitrate before it can leach into waterways. 
While Tesdell sells a bag of the grain here and there and gets to graze “the woolies” as he calls the flock, on the harvested field, the crop is more of an experiment. It has been grown in drier climates like Kansas and Nebraska, but Tesdell, and researchers at The Land Institute don’t know how the grain performs in Iowa.

Kernza is the grain produced from intermediate wheatgrass and was cultivated with the goal of creating a perennial grain for human consumption that would also reduce inputs and labor for farmers while providing environmental benefits. 
Tammy Kimbler, chief communications officer at The Land Institute, said the institute is working to analyze the conditions under which Kernza could be optimally grown across the country.

Kimbler said the institute has a “pretty good feel” for the purpose Kernza can serve in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Kansas and Nebraska, where most of the grain has been planted. But it’s seeking a more “robust understanding” of the soil types, water, climate, historic crops and farmer knowledge in other states, like Iowa, that would impact Kernza adoption. 
In drier climates, Kernza is valuable for its drought tolerance and ability to hold onto the soil. Studies in Minnesota have shown Kernza can absorb 96% more nitrate from soils than soybeans and corn. The crop has been planted around certain wellheads in Minnesota to evaluate if the crop could reduce the concentration of nitrate in drinking water. 
High nitrate concentrations in Iowa drinking water sources has been an issue for decades. Recently, the issue was top of mind for central Iowans as Central Iowa Water Works issued its first-ever lawn watering ban to control demand on the system and remain compliant with federal drinking water standards while nitrate concentrations in the rivers soared.
“Kernza is a potential solution to that, because of the roots — and because of its perennial nature, it’s doing work all year, as opposed to just during the growing season,” Kimbler said. 
In addition to the environmental benefits, as a perennial, versus an annual grain, Kernza reduces the number of times a farmer has to drive a tractor over the field to seed a crop, which The Land Institute also views as a benefit.

What’s it like growing Kernza? 
Tesdell, who is in his third year with the crop, called it a “robust” plant. The first season he planted his seven-acre plot, he was worried it would be overtaken by weeds and other species in the field, but in the second year in the field, he said, the Kernza “just took over.” 
His only input is some nitrogen fertilizer, but he said it takes a small amount compared to a crop like corn. 
Tesdell gets three products out of the Kernza. The grain, which he takes to Nebraska for processing with the Sustain-a-Grain group where it is turned into the “flakes” he can sell to as a breakfast cereal or to breweries in the area. He also bales the plant and is able to sell it and use it like hay and finally, Tesdell grazes his sheep on the harvested Kernza fields. 
But even with the multiple uses, marketing the grain is enough of a challenge right now, that Tesdell said it probably won’t take off as a popular crop in Iowa. 
“For me, I’m interested in science; I’m interested in experimenting with crops,” Tesdell said. “I like the environmental benefits, system benefits because you get these really deep roots and there’s absolutely no surface erosion coming off that (field) there’s no way anything could escape.” 
In addition to the Kernza plot, Tesdell has strips of his family property dedicated to prairie and even though he personally doesn’t grow corn and soybeans, he seeds cover crops on the portions of his land that he rents to neighboring row-crop farmers. 
“That’s one thing I want to do is keep the top soil where it should be,” Tesdell said. 
Because it’s still a bit of an experimental crop in Iowa, Tesdell said he’s not sure how long the plants will have a high grain yield. He plans to harvest for grain again next year, which would be the fourth year of the plants, and then assess if it needs to be replanted.
“I just, I have no idea,” Tesdell said.

Developing the Kernza market 
Tesdell said he hasn’t filled out his spreadsheets for the year, but said he’d be “lucky to be breaking even” on the crop. 
“It’s not going to be a popular type of crop in row-crop Iowa, because it doesn’t yield very much,” Tesdell said. “And then the marketing is a challenge.” 
Tesdell travels to Nebraska, or pays to ship his Kernza harvest to Nebraska, to be processed into “flakes,” an oatmeal-like product, at a miller that works with other Kernza growers. It’s a bit more complicated, and expensive, than hauling his harvest to the local farm cooperative and selling it in one go.
Kimbler said in addition to understanding the practicalities around farming Kernza, farmers need access to processors and viable markets if the grain is to become more popular. The crop has been used like oatmeal, ground into flours and used as a brewing ingredient in beer.
Beer doesn’t offer a huge market for Kernza, but Kimbler said a Kernza beer gives people an opportunity to engage with the grain and its agricultural significance. 
“Because beer is such a social product, it has a tradition of storytelling that carries with it, it’s turned out beer, and brewers in particular, are amazing ambassadors,” Kimbler said. 
Farm Hand on tap 
Kernza has been a featured ingredient in select beers at breweries in Kansas, Oregon and other states but is now in a beer on tap at Brightside Aleworks in Altoona.
Andrew Frana, the head brewer and owner of Brightside, said he tries to feature local ingredients and producers as often as he can. 
The brewery hosts farmers’ markets, is a member of the state’s Choose Iowa program and collaborates with the Iowa Food Cooperative, where he first met Tesdell.

Frana learned about Tesdell’s perennial crop and decided to give it a try. 
“We found that it acts similarly to rye and wheat, and it’s a fairly high protein grain compared to those two, so it works well in our hazy IPAs,” Frana said. “It adds body, mouth feel, head retention – foam on top of the beer – it does similar things to those grains, but it’s more sustainable and super local.” 
Farm Hand is a hazy IPA — India pale ale — brewed with Nelson and Riwaka hops and has 7.0% alcohol by volume. 
Frana said the Kernza in the beer acts like the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG) or rice wine vinegar in cooking. 
“It just makes everything pop and brighten up so much,” he said. 
Right now, Kernza is a fairly pricey grain to work with, but Frana cares about conservation practices, regenerative agriculture and wants to support the endeavor.
“It is close to our heart to work as much as we can reducing our impacts,” Frana said. “… we would like to be a first mover in this project to bring notoriety to (Kernza) as a sustainable product here in Iowa.
Frana said when he works with a local ingredient, be it Tesdell’s Kernza or tea from Gong Fu in Des Moines’ East Village, he tries to build the beer so it highlights the ingredient. 
Farm Hand is on tap currently and he said it should last into the first half of January before the keg is dry. 
“But we do intend to work with Kernza in the future,” Frana said.

Records of the Iowa Board of Respiratory Care and Polysomnography show that respiratory therapist Philip A. Kester, 41, has been charged with habitual intoxication or addiction including the excessive use of alcohol or drugs in a manner that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice skill and safety.
He is also charged with negligence in the practice of the profession, failure to cooperate with an investigation of the board, and failure to respond within 30 days to a communication from the board.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board has not publicly disclosed any of the alleged actions that led to the filing of the charges other than to say they occurred at some unspecified time in the past when Kester was practicing in Des Moines.
A board hearing on the matter is scheduled for Feb. 3, 2026.
State records indicate Kester was first issued an Iowa respiratory care practitioner’s license in May 2012.
Court records indicate that in November 2019, Kester was arrested and charged with drunken driving. According to a police report, he was stopped for driving the wrong way on E.P. True Parkway in West Des Moines, showed signs of being intoxicated, and then refused to submit to a preliminary breath test. After pleading guilty to a charge of first-offense drunken driving, Kester was sentenced to one year of probation.
In February 2021, Kester was arrested again on a charge of drunken driving. In that case, Ames police alleged they found Kester’s vehicle in a ditch with Kester still inside the car. According to the police report, Kester showed signs of inebriation and testing showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.275 – more than three times the legal limit for driving. After pleading guilty to second-offense drunken driving, Kester was sentenced to one week in jail and one year of probation.

Along the 487-mile historic corridor crossing New Mexico from east to west, they’re restoring gas stations, painting murals, installing public art and fixing up neon signs. They’re planning community-wide parties featuring vintage cars, air shows and historical presentations about how the “Mother Road” shaped life in their communities.

That’s according to a list of roughly $4 million in grants the state Tourism Department has offered over the last two years to promote the centennial. Grants for infrastructure, marketing and special events range from $4,000, like for the Pinto Bean Route 66 Centennial Fiesta in Moriarty, to $250,000 for art installations in Albuquerque. 
New Mexico State Historian Rob Martinez told Source New Mexico the celebrations are fitting to celebrate a road that connected the country and had profound impacts on tiny towns alongside it. Like the Camino Real and Santa Fe Trail, Route 66 created a “crossroads” of people and culture, he said. 
“These trails and roads are very important in not just promoting New Mexico, but establishing our culture and changing it, bringing new peoples and new technologies and new ideas on the asphalt,” he said.

Beginning in 1926, with the help of congressional legislation creating a public highway system, the United States began building Route 66, seeking to connect growing cities and rural communities across the country with the help of the automobile.
Doing so in the state of New Mexico proved challenging due to its topography, according to the state Tourism Department. The first iteration of Route 66 entered New Mexico via Texas and shot northward to Santa Fe through Santa Rosa and Tucumcari, before dropping to Albuquerque through Los Lunas, heading back toward Laguna Pueblo and entering into Arizona just past Gallup.
Depression-era public works spending allowed the route to be straightened — eliminating the Los Lunas section — and paved. It was the first paved road in history. From there, it became the most famous American road in history, Martinez said.

New Mexico’s slice of Route 66 has appeared in multiple works of art since then, according to Martinez. He remembers an episode of “I Love Lucy” featuring a road trip on Route 66 through Albuquerque. Nat King Cole sings about “Gallup, New Mexico” in the classic 1946 “Get Your Kicks,” and the 1940 film adaptation of John Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath” starring Henry Fonda features the state prominently. 
“Tulsa, Oklahoma is considered the capital of Route 66, although I would say it should be Gallup or Albuquerque,” Martinez said. “Though, I’m biased.”
Other projects the Tourism Department funded are beautification of highway overpasses in Guadalupe County, an improved gateway in Albuquerque’s Old Town and upgrades to the State Fair Tower and RV village at the New Mexico State Fair grounds.
Santa Rosa received $60,000 for a “musical road” along a half-mile stretch of Route 66 east of the village, paying local company San Bar Construction to install custom rumble strips on the shoulder of the road. At the right speed, drivers who steer their tires onto the rumble strips will hear “Get Your Kicks” playing.

Lisa Brassell, part of the town’s Route 66 committee, told Source that not all of the funding has come together yet. First, the village will need to secure the rights for the song, and the New Mexico Transportation Department will have to re-pave the road to remove any potholes that might cause a false note, she said.
“Otherwise, nobody can tell what the song is,” she said, laughing.
But even without the musical rumble strips, she said Santa Rosa has festivities planned throughout the year, including the regular use of one local man and his 1926 vintage car. “He’s become kind of a mascot,” she said. 
She said Santa Rosa is just one of dozens of New Mexico communities putting their own local flavor on the celebration. 
“It depends on each individual community, on how they capture that essence, that contribution that the Mother Road has made for our communities, especially in rural New Mexico,” she said. “We’re working hard in our communities to celebrate the birthday.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Route66GettyRF-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-01 10:12:02.452677

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A Myrtle Beach Democrat wants voters to know he’s still challenging U.S. Rep. Russell Fry: Never mind his social media post months ago about suspending his campaign.
It was a rookie mistake, John Vincent recently told the SC Daily Gazette.

The retired Navy officer explained that his Facebook announcement in mid-May — saying “we’ve decided to suspend our campaign and focus on activism” — was just a nine-day pause, not an exit from his bid to flip the 7th District.
“I didn’t realize that’s a word in politics that basically means ‘I quit,’” the first-time candidate told the Gazette, referring to the word “suspend.”
He added: “I only wish that my fundraising emails would get as much attention.”
It’s exceedingly rare for a candidate to announce the suspension of a campaign, then jump back into the same race.
After doing a little research, Vincent’s communications director, Scott Billings, pointed to one other candidate for state or federal office who’d done so: In 2006, Republican Michele Bachmann, then a Minnesota state senator, suspended her bid for Congress for her own medical treatment, then came back and won. (However, when she suspended her presidential run in January 2012 ahead of the South Carolina primary, that meant — as it normally does — that she dropped out.)
Vincent’s post, one month after his campaign’s public launch in Florence, came amid his mother-in-law’s rapidly declining health. He needed to go to Iowa to help coordinate her care and didn’t want to ask for donations or volunteers when he expected to be gone for several months, he said.
But by June, Vincent had renewed his effort to become the first Democrat in modern history to represent the 7th District, which spans the Grand Strand and much of the Pee Dee. And he has an expanded campaign staff to help.
After his mother-in-law’s death in August, Vincent hosted the Fighting for Democracy Festival in North Myrtle Beach, which he said roughly 400 people attended.
Vincent, who retired in 2003 as command master chief petty officer after 20 years in the Navy, has called Myrtle Beach home for over two years. His campaign website sums up his campaign platform with three broad messages: “fight government chaos,” “support families,” and “honor veterans and those who serve.”
Asked about his opponent, Fry said he wasn’t aware he still had one.
“John Vincent hasn’t dropped out again? That’s news to me,” the Horry County Republican said in a statement to the Gazette. “He’s a socialist wannabe pretending to be an everyday guy, pushing higher taxes, more regulations, and open-border policies that hurt our economy and make our communities less safe.”

Voters first sent Fry, a former state House legislator, to Washington in 2022, after he ousted five-term incumbent Tom Rice in that year’s GOP primary.
Rice had angered many Republicans by voting to impeach President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, prompting a crowded field of Republican challengers. Trump endorsed Fry, who won a seven-way race with 51% of the vote, avoiding a runoff with Rice, who trailed by 26.5 percentage points, according to results from the state Election Commission.
In his November 2024 re-election contest, Fry received 65% of the vote, the most decisive win for the 7th District this century.
A Democrat last represented the 7th District in the early 1930s, when it dissolved with the state’s population loss. South Carolina re-gained a seventh congressional district with the 2010 census. Since voting maps were redrawn to add a district anchored by Horry County, Rice and Fry have been its only representatives.
The Grand Strand hasn’t been represented by a Democrat since the early 1990s, when it still was part of the 6th District.
“South Carolina — and the people of the 7th District — will reject the reckless agenda of Zohran Mamdani and his fanboy John Vincent, or whoever Democrats decide to install next,” Fry said in his statement to this outlet.
Vincent called the comparison to Mamdani a reach. “He is a very, very progressive guy; I’m a very moderate guy,” Vincent said of the Democrat recently elected mayor of New York City.
In his May 13 social media post to suspend his campaign, Vincent sounded dejected about his chances: “The door is not shut, but we can’t win without people who believe, and this district is not close today,” the post read.

At the time, Vincent told the Gazette, he was disheartened by the lack of infrastructure for Democratic candidates in the district, and the roughly dozen volunteers working on his campaign all had very little political experience.
Days later, Vincent resumed posting about the race and criticizing Fry.
He hired JGS Strategies (JGS is short for Just Getting Started), a consulting firm that touts helping candidates win office in South Carolina and beyond since 2021. And he’s learned how to adapt his “off-the-cuff” public speaking style to politics, he said.
For example, he said, “I’ve learned jokes aren’t good.”
As of Sept. 30, Vincent had raised about $69,000 total for the campaign. After expenses, his campaign had just over $15,000 available when the third quarter ended, according to his latest filing with the Federal Election Commission.
By comparison, Fry had almost $762,000 cash on hand Sept. 30, according to his third-quarter filing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-1024x769.jpg,,,2026-01-01 09:11:40.400802
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-01 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Constituents are seldom heard in the Mississippi Legislature. Legal experts say easy fixes could amplify people’s voices,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/01/constituents-mississippi-legislature/,"Unlike some other statehouses in the U.S., there are no formal opportunities for constituents in Mississippi to provide public comment or testimony in committee hearings, remotely or in writing.","When the Mississippi Legislature reconvenes in the Capitol’s marbled halls in January, one voice will scarcely be heard: constituents’. 
Citizens and advocates are occasionally invited by lawmakers to speak at the Capitol. But unlike some other statehouses in the U.S., there are no formal opportunities for constituents in Mississippi to provide public comment or testimony in committee hearings, remotely or in writing. 
“Constituents should have a voice when it comes to policy making,” said Sarah Moreland-Russell, an associate professor in the School of Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied testimony’s impact on the lawmaking process. 
Moreland-Russell said she was “very surprised” to learn that there are no opportunities for Mississippi’s citizens to regularly provide testimony at the statehouse. 
“If you’re not hearing from the people that are actually being affected by a policy, then how do you know it’s truly going to be effective?” she asked.
In Louisiana, House and Senate rules mandate proponents and opponents of bills have the opportunity to speak on a piece of legislation. In Alaska, a network of 22 offices across the state provide opportunities to participate in legislative meetings and submit written public comment, as well as provide legislative information to constituents in remote parts of the state. Every bill in Colorado receives a hearing with public comment. And in Arizona, an online system allows residents to register opinions and request to testify on bills from their homes. 
Moreland-Russell’s research showed that most legislators, regardless of political party, find testimony from constituents and experts influential. Testimony increased lawmakers’ awareness of issues, encouraged them to conduct additional research and sometimes even changed their votes. 
“Stories can be extremely influential,” Moreland-Russell said. She said legislators found personal anecdotes paired with data to back it up most impactful. 
In Mississippi, bills frequently fly through the committee process, oftentimes with little discussion by lawmakers and no input from the public. The Senate’s typo-riddled bill to phase out the income tax — one of the most notable bills to come out of the 2025 legislative session — quickly passed through committee with little debate. 
Senate Public Health Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory who has served in the Legislature since 1984, said committee hearings used to involve frequent debate, amendments and discussion among subcommittees.
“Everything now is just perfunctory,” he said, meaning it is routine or superficial. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many state legislatures implemented new ways for the public  to participate remotely, including options to present remote testimony or gather constituent feedback online.
But Mississippians who do not live in Jackson or can not attend the Legislature still do not have the opportunity to watch many of the state’s committee proceedings. The Mississippi House of Representatives does not livestream or record its committee meetings, though it does livestream proceedings in the House chamber.
Meanwhile, the Mississippi Senate livestreams most of its committee meetings and all of its full chamber proceedings. This is a marker of Lt. Gov Delbert Hosemann’s commitment to transparency, spokesperson Hannah Milliet said in an email. 
House Speaker Jason White, a Republican from West, told Mississippi Today in 2024 that he has no objection to livestreaming committee hearings and said the Rules Committee would look into the policy. 
House Rules Chairman Fred Shanks, a Republican from Brandon, said in November there has not been any talk of livestreaming the meetings. White did not respond to a request for comment. 
Simple changes, such as requiring committees to provide notice of hearings and publish agendas ahead of time, would give constituents more opportunities to participate in the legislative process, said Safia Malin, interim policy director for Jackson-based civic engagement nonprofit, One Voice.
The Senate has a page on the Legislature’s website to publish agendas, though they are not always shared. The House does not post agendas online. And committee hearings in both chambers occasionally occur at the last minute. 
Rep. Jeramey Anderson, a Democrat from Escatawpa, has proposed a rule to require House committees to post agendas 24 hours before meeting for the past seven years. None have ever made it out of committee. 
“Mississippians deserve to know what bills are being taken up before they walk into a committee room — not five minutes before, and not after the decisions are already made,” Anderson said in a written statement to Mississippi Today. 
“The refusal to provide even basic notice isn’t an accident,” he said. “It’s a deliberate choice that keeps the public from testifying, keeps advocates from participating, and keeps voters from holding their elected officials accountable.” 
The state Legislature is allowed to meet behind closed doors. The Mississippi Ethics Commission has repeatedly ruled that the Legislature is not covered by the state’s open meetings law. Hinds County Chancellor Dewayne Thomas affirmed the ruling in February. 
The House Republican Caucus — which holds a strong majority — frequently meets behind closed doors before committee meetings, effectively shielding discussion on legislation from the public.  
Shanks said he has never had a constituent ask him about speaking at the Capitol. He said he makes his phone number available for constituents to call him at any time.  
“As far as somebody making a public comment at a committee meeting, a lot of our committee meetings are pretty quick, and some of them are last minute. They may have one right after (floor) session,” Shanks said. 
“It would be pretty hard to do.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06124146/3X0A2518-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-01 09:11:40.400802

Trump is suing to block it,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2026/01/california-labor-law-under-fire/,A new law backed by California unions gives a state board the right to regulate working conditions and labor rights as the federal labor board’s fate is in limbo.,"In summary
A new law backed by California unions gives a state board the right to regulate working conditions and labor rights as the federal labor board’s fate is in limbo. 


California under a law taking effect today seeks to uphold the labor and unionization rights of private-sector employees, as the federal agency that has held that power for decades is in limbo. 
But the new law’s future is unclear because the Trump administration is challenging it. 
The law, which grants more powers to the California Public Employment Relations Board, is a response to the National Labor Relations Board lacking a quorum.
President Donald Trump fired the NLRB’s chairperson, Gwynne Wilcox, days after he began his second term in January. His two nominees to the board have yet to be confirmed, so the federal board has been without the three members it needs for a quorum for months. 
Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the Inglewood Democrat who wrote the bill, said when the governor signed it in September that “California will not sit idly as its workers are systematically denied the right to organize due to employer intransigence or federal inaction.”

The NLRB sued California over the law in October, saying in its lawsuit that the state is trying to assert authority over “areas explicitly reserved for federal oversight.”
On the legal challenge to the law, Terry Schanz, McKinnor’s chief of staff, referred CalMatters to the state attorney general. Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office is responsible for defending the law in court. A spokesperson for Bonta said the office would have nothing to say about it. 
With the NLRB unable to fulfill its duties, states are trying to fill the gap in enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, which Congress passed in 1935. But labor experts contacted by CalMatters do not have high hopes for the California law, which is similar to a law passed in New York this year. They said courts, including the Supreme Court, have ruled that states cannot decide matters pertaining to federal labor law because of preemption, the doctrine that a higher authority of law overrides a lower authority.
“It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where the courts do not overturn these (state) laws,” said John Logan, professor and chairperson of Labor and Employment Studies at San Francisco State University. 
William Gould, a former chairperson of the National Labor Relations Board during the Clinton administration and a professor emeritus at Stanford University, agreed: “In the courts the matter is a dead letter unless (the Supreme Court) shifts gears.” 
That’s what the California and U.S. chambers of commerce, along with other business groups, are hoping, according to their amicus brief in support of the Trump administration’s lawsuit against California: “Under California’s view, every state could have its own labor law for private-sector workers. Dozens of laws would overlap and collide.” 
The California Labor Federation, an umbrella organization for unions that represents about 2 million California workers, said in an amicus brief that even before Trump fired the NLRB chief, the federal agency’s backlog had been a problem, leading to companies being able to delay bargaining in good faith with their employees’ unions without consequences.
If the California law is overturned, employees who have formed unions but have not succeeded in securing contracts with employers such as Amazon and Starbucks — which are among the companies seeking to have the NLRB declared unconstitutional — may continue to face delays, according to Logan. Or, he said, it’s not clear what would happen if other workers tried to organize and their companies simply fired them. 
“The NLRB defunctness is a scandal which cries out for political reform,” Gould said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/121924_Amazon_Strike_SF-02-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-01 08:57:06.539886

New Safe Homes grants program, taking effect on Jan. 1, 2026, could begin taking applications in the spring, CA insurance department says.


Some homeowners in areas of California with high wildfire risk could eventually get money for new roofs or to build fire-resistant zones around their properties under a new state law that goes into effect today.
The Safe Homes grant program is designed to help low- and middle-income homeowners with fire mitigation. People who qualify could use grants to create 5-foot ember-resistant zones around properties, also known as Zone Zero, as required by law in some areas. The program will also contribute toward costs for fire-safe roofs.
The state’s Insurance Department, which is responsible for implementing the program, is working out the details around eligibility, the amount of and the distribution of grants. It is now developing an application portal that it hopes to have ready by March, said Michael Soller, spokesperson for the department.
The insurance department will be handling all the details of the grants, said Mike Dayton, chief of staff of Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, the Los Angeles-area Democrat and chair of the Assembly Insurance Committee who wrote the law, and has so far secured $3 million in the state budget to get the program started.

Soller said homeowners who have policies with admitted insurance carriers or the last-resort FAIR Plan and who live in high-risk areas will have to meet income limits set by the state housing department to be eligible for the grants, whose amounts have not been determined. Communities, cities and counties with mitigation projects could also apply for grants. 
He also said the insurance department plans to advocate for additional and ongoing funding for the program. 
Another source of funding could be the federal government, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Soller said. But Gov. Gavin Newsom recently tried to meet with FEMA to talk about disaster aid related to the Los Angeles County fires and was unsuccessful. 
Also, two Californians in Congress have proposed legislation that would establish a federal grant program and tax credits for mitigation. U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson, a Napa Democrat, and Doug LaMalfa, an Oroville Republican, have introduced their bill for the past two sessions, but it has not made it to a floor vote.

Orr is exploring a new funding model for higher education. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Senator chair for Alabama’s education budget committee is working on drafting a bill that could change how some higher education institutions are funded.
Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, said in an interview Friday the new model, called outcomes based funding, could push the public colleges and universities in the state to attain better graduation rates, increase workforce participation and help with research.
“How can we incentivize certain institutions to help them keep those students in school? Well, it all takes money. It takes resources. So the money that we would provide, we would say, ‘Okay, college, your four year graduation right now is 8%. We’d like to see that next year get to 10% or 12%.’ It’s gonna take time, but we’re going to reward movement.”

At the Nov. 12 Joint Modernizing Higher Education Funding Committee, Orr said he was using the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) Act as a model for how the new higher education funding bill would look. 
The RAISE Act, which passed in the 2025 regular session, gives K-12 schools extra funding to help certain classes of students, such as English language learners and special education students.
Orr said other states use a similar method to fund higher education institutions.
“What we’d like to do is follow the models other states have used called outcome based funding,” he said. “We will challenge the various schools, our 14 schools of higher education, plus community colleges to attain goals that we would like to see.”
Other states that use outcomes based funding include Tennessee, Texas, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri among others.
Under the proposal, larger schools in the state like Auburn University and the University of Alabama that have higher graduation rates will get funding help in research areas.
“We wouldn’t challenge them with that, it’d be like you do pretty good. It’s not, it’s not worth quibbling over,” Orr said. “There’s not really a return on that investment. So the flagships are in a little bit of a different area. They do a lot more research. So I think we’ll focus more on research for them than things like graduation rates.”
Other outcomes Orr’s bill will focus on are innovation and workforce development.
“What are the job needs of Alabama in the future? Well, I can tell you today, it’s teachers and educators. It’s nurses and people in the healthcare field. It’s engineers and people like that,” he said “So can we reward schools for increasing their output of students in these high demand vocations? And we may not reward them for — we’re not gonna penalize them — an ancient languages studies department, that’s probably not a needed area here in Alabama. It’s a must to help move our state forward.”
Innovation includes how the colleges and universities offer degrees, weekend classes and impact on the state.
Orr said roughly 30% of the funding for higher education in the Educational Opportunity Fund is for higher education while the other 70% is for K-12. The Educational Opportunity Fund is part of the Education Trust Fund.
“That Educational Opportunity Fund has about a billion dollars in it right now. We took over $300 million last year, and put it in, I’m calling it the RAISE Act fund, so that was strictly for K-12,” he said.
Jim Purcell, executive director for the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, said in a statement Friday the new plan could be difficult due to differences in the institutions.
“Designing performance-based funding incentives across a diverse range of university types presents challenges, given differences in mission, size, and student populations,” the statement said. “It is anticipated that any future incentive structure would include institution-specific considerations.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC05050-e1744232188836-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-01 08:13:33.263369

As Congress debates whether to extend the temporary federal subsidies that have helped millions of Americans buy health coverage, a crucial underlying reality is sometimes overlooked: Those subsidies are merely a band-aid covering the often unaffordable cost of health care.
California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and five other states have set caps on health care spending in a bid to rein in the intense financial pressure felt by many families, individuals, and employers who every year face increases in premiums, deductibles, and other health-related expenses.
Hospitals and other health care providers are citing Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, as one more reason to challenge those limits.
The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade, which mathematically should help the overall health care system meet the caps. But the law is also expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans, mostly Medicaid beneficiaries, by an estimated 10 million people. Health care analysts predict hospitals and other providers will raise prices to cover the double whammy of lost Medicaid revenue and the cost of caring for an influx of newly uninsured patients.
Whether regulators in some states will allow providers to justify higher prices and exceed the spending caps is unclear. Only California and Oregon can penalize providers financially if they fail to meet targets.
“Are we going to say, ‘That’s OK’? Or are we going to say, ‘Well, you exceeded the target. We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board. “That has not yet been decided.”
The California Hospital Association, the industry’s main state lobbying group, filed a lawsuit in October asking a state court to strike down the spending caps, which it argued fail to account for all the cost pressures hospitals face. Those pressures, it said, include an aging, sicker population; the rising cost of labor; expensive advances in medical technology; large capital outlays on required seismic retrofitting; and changes in federal policy, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The hospital group’s lawsuit also asserted that the state affordability office, by hastily imposing ill-considered cost-cutting targets, was undermining its other key mission of improving health care access, quality, and equity.
California’s affordability office in 2024 set a five-year target to cap statewide spending growth, starting at 3.5% in 2025 and declining to 3% by 2029. The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers, and other payers.
In 2025, it imposed much lower spending growth caps — starting at 1.8% in 2026 and declining to 1.6% by 2029 — for seven “high-cost” hospitals.
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding, and losing access to critical services,” Carmela Coyle, the hospital association’s president and CEO, said in an October press release.
The California attorney general’s office, which will represent the affordability agency, has not yet filed a response to the hospital group’s complaint and did not respond to a request for comment.
Hospitals’ pushback
California is not the only state taking a close look at hospital prices, which are widely considered a primary driver of health care costs.
“States, armed with information that points to payments to hospitals as a driver of what is way beyond affordable commercial premiums, have begun to take increasingly targeted actions focused on commercial hospital prices,” said Michael Bailit, founder of the Needham, Massachusetts-based consultancy Bailit Health, which has advised multiple states, including California, on ways to tame health care spending. “It is not surprising that the hospital industry is going to oppose such state actions.”
In its lawsuit, the California Hospital Association said the affordability office’s own report showed that pharmaceutical and insurance companies are largely responsible for high costs.
Hospitals in some states with cost growth limits, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, have expressed objections similar to the ones raised in the California lawsuit. They could follow their counterparts in California if their lawsuit succeeds, said Peter Lee, who led California’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, Covered California, for over a decade and is now a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.
Lee said the work of California’s affordability office and similar agencies in other states is just about the only systemwide effort being made to cut health care costs. They are basically saying, “‘Look, health care is taking money away from education, it is taking money away from the environment, it is taking money away from everything in the public sector, and in the private sector it is taking money away from wages,’” he said. “‘We don’t know how you, the health system, are going to do it, but it is your job not just to provide quality but to lower costs. Here’s the target.’”
To be sure, achieving the cost savings that California and those other states are seeking is no easy lift. It will ultimately require persuading large, financially powerful players that compete fiercely for health care dollars to adopt a different mindset and begin cooperating to reduce costs instead. And that, in many cases, will mean lower revenue.
But the status quo, as many people know all too well, means continued financial pain for millions.
In early 2020, Estevan Rodriguez, a bartender at California’s Monterey Beach Hotel, had surgery for a staph infection in his leg. The bill came to nearly $168,000. His insurance paid most of it, but he still owed $5,665, which took him two years to pay, more than $200 every month. “It may not be a lot to some people, but it was a lot to me,” Rodriguez said.
He said he dropped his Hulu subscription, switched to a lower-cost cellphone, and got cheaper car insurance. He started going to food banks rather than the grocery store, he said, and had a lot less time with his kids, because he was constantly working to pay off the hospital bill.
Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where Rodriguez had his surgery, is one of the seven hospitals identified by California’s affordability office as high-cost. A study by the office attributed high hospital prices in Monterey County to a lack of market competition “rather than higher operating costs or superior quality of care.”
The Monterey hospital referred a request for comment about its “high-cost” designation to the California Hospital Association. CHA spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea declined to comment beyond the language of the lawsuit and Coyle’s press release statement.
Reduced competition
Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close. One study estimates 338 rural hospitals are at risk of closing nationwide.
Less competition, in addition to fewer Medicaid dollars and an increase in uninsured patients, will only strengthen the incentive of health systems with the requisite market clout to raise their commercial prices, increasing premiums for employers and individuals.
“We think commercial prices will continue to increase as health care providers, and hospitals in particular, will seek to preserve or increase their revenue,” said Rachel Block, a program officer at the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation that focuses on health equity.
That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.
California’s affordability office is required to consider mitigating factors, including changes in federal and state laws. But some of its board members have expressed skepticism about letting hospitals offset Medicaid losses with higher commercial prices.
“There’s a lot of talk about using HR 1 and other federal policies as an excuse to raise prices on commercial payers,” Ian Lewis, an affordability office board member and policy director for UNITE HERE Local 2, a hospitality workers union in the Bay Area, said at the agency’s July board meeting, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s no more blood to be squeezed from this stone.”

Laura Kelly holds a Chiefs jersey with team owner Clark Hunt ahead of a news conference Dec. 22, 2025, at the Kansas Docking State Office Building in Topeka. (Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)The Kansas Chiefs are dead to me.
After Kansas jayhawked Missouri’s last NFL team last week, I vowed I would never again watch them. I cursed the day the team formed and Clark Hunt’s performance in Topeka reminded of Mark Twain’s quote about gratitude: 
“If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.”
When Lamar Hunt founded the AFL, he put his team in Dallas. When the NFL countered by creating the Dallas Cowboys and the team was starving for fans, Kansas City welcomed him and made the rebranded team prosperous.
That’s Kansas City, Missouri. Like the Chiefs last week, Kansas’ envy of and desire to steal everything good about our state showed when it named a border town as Kansas City, Kansas, in 1872, more than 20 years after the real Kansas City was named.
Anyway, Kansas City made the Chiefs prosperous, and now the Hunt family is biting it.
The NFL has been a part of my Sunday for most of my life, beginning with dreams of playing professional football when I was a child in grade-school YMCA leagues.
I am old enough to remember the Chiefs winning Super Bowl IV. I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, a place without its own team. My older brother had adopted the Minnesota Vikings as his favorite, and I took great pleasure in their defeat in the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl until 2020.
I wasn’t a Chiefs fan until I moved to Missouri and I didn’t switch my childhood allegiance from the Cleveland Browns to the Chiefs until 1989, when the team hired Marty Schottenheimer after he was fired by the Browns.
I thought it was stupid because the only thing Schottenheimer hadn’t done for the Browns is get them to the Super Bowl. It was what the owner, Art Modell, wanted more than anything because the Browns had five chances — two before the 1969 NFL-AFL merger and three since — to get there.
Modell got his wish after moving the team to Baltimore, rebranded as the Ravens, and the Browns were reborn as an expansion team to be one of the doormats of the NFL.
For the Chiefs. Schottenheimer’s hiring ushered in one of the best eras for being a fan. Joe Montana finished his career alongside Marcus Allen and the team made it all the way to an AFC Championship game.
But it is the current era under Andy Reid, another coach fired by a previous team for the sin of not winning a Super Bowl, that brought the team global fame. The dazzling play of Patrick Mahomes, the adorably wholesome romance of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, and playing in five of six Super Bowls has helped burnish the image of Kansas City, MISSOURI, to the point where jayhawking the team became the only important issue in Kansas.
‘Jennison’s Jayhawkers,’ a drawing published in 1864 depicting Kansas guerrillas under Col. Charles ‘Doc’ Jennison pillaging civilians in Missouri (Library of Congress image).
The term jayhawk, by the way, does not refer to a bird. It is steeped in the history of our state, coined even before the Civil War to describe the activity of Kansas outlaws who rustled cattle and stole property on a grand scale.
This summer, in a panic, Gov. Mike Kehoe called Missouri lawmakers into a special session to offer a lucrative handout package for the Chiefs to stay. 
Missouri’s hand has bite marks because Clark Hunt wanted more, and got it. The Kansas funding scheme is, according to one analysis, the most lopsided stadium deal in sports history.
I love my adopted state. I love its history and its sports teams make me proud. I have never had a team I rooted for in bad and good times have the kind of successful run that the Chiefs have had — in venerable Arrowhead Stadium in MISSOURI — in recent years.
But their luck changed this year. After winning almost every one-score game in 2024 on their way to Super Bowl LIX, they won only one this year and won’t make the playoffs.
I hope they never win another game and I will never watch the Chiefs again.
I’m going back to rooting for the Browns.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC220319-1024x576-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 08:13:33.263369

New Jersey drivers will shell out more for tolls as the new year starts.
Motorists using the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway will see 3% increases on all vehicle classes, hikes approved by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in November as part of its 2026 budget.
Tolls at the Parkway’s barrier plazas will spike 8 cents, while tolls at entries and exits will increase by 3 cents. The average Turnpike toll will go up by approximately 16 cents. The Turnpike Authority in 2020 approved a plan to automatically increase tolls by 3% annually.
The Atlantic City Expressway will overhaul its tolling system beginning Jan. 4, when the state’s first all-electronic toll collection system becomes operational. A new fee will be implemented for Expressway drivers who don’t use E-ZPass and will instead be charged a fee of $13.60, more than double the E-ZPass rate. Tolls for drivers using E-ZPass will rise 3%.
Drivers using Delaware River bridges will also see an increase, approved by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission at its Nov. 24 meeting. E-ZPass tolls will increase from $1.50 to $2, and toll-by-plate charges will go up from $3 to $5.
The tolls at the bridges and tunnels overseen by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will also increase in the new year. The agency’s board approved 3% increases and an additional 25 cents to help fund its $45 billion capital plan. E-ZPass tolls during peak travel will increase from $16.06 to $16.79, and off-peak tolls will go up from $14.06 to $14.73. Pay-by-plate drivers will see the current toll of $22.38 go up to $23.05.

Lawmakers, it would significantly help parents to have an age 18 minimum law on social media use. Start treating social media like cigarettes and every other addictive product on the market.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A.M. Derrendinger: We need you to say ‘No’ to the gift you will regret having given.","This commentary is by AM Derrendinger, of Middletown Springs. She is in 9th grade and is a writer.  



“It’s here to stay,” people declare, and shrug their shoulders defeatedly. “We live in a digital world, and today’s kids are digital natives. They need to learn how to survive an AI driven future.”
Most leave it at that, convinced of the same lies that Big Tech has successfully sold us for years. How hard the tech giants must be laughing, some of whom reportedly would never let their own kids near the products they make: smart devices, social media, video games, the lot!
They know how unnecessary – and detrimental – such products are to children’s successful development. Yet they have little to fear when it comes to accountability. Mark Zuckerberg’s social media products have been linked by some to thousands of teen users who have lost their lives within recent years, and many adults respond by saying, “Our kids need to learn how to use Instagram responsibly.”
That terrifies me.
As a 14-year-old without a smart device, social media or video games, I’ve watched as my peers are promised optimal social connection and the joyride of their lives as they’re handed their first smartphones and social media accounts. I then see youth isolation and depression skyrocket, academic performance plummet and the child become addicted. Their flowering promise wilts, and their caregiver knows no better until it’s too late. It’s a tragic tale, which keeps happening again and again.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Where are the adults who are supposed to say “no” to health- harming products that have been killing children under their noses for more than a decade? I, the adolescent, shouldn’t have to spread awareness. I shouldn’t have to write this op-ed pleading with parents, educators, legislators and every other responsible community member to wake up.
Yet here I am, spelling out how all those kids became connected to drug dealers by Snapchat (and died), mimicked self- strangulation TikTok videos (and died) and were led to predators and sex traffickers on Instagram (and also died). They were just like your kid. 
They are that one sitting on her smartphone on the sofa over there. A naturally curious, loved, cherished kiddo, prone to making mistakes for which she doesn’t deserve to die. I’m referring to kids who were healthy, happy prior to depression and no less loved. They didn’t deserve addiction and the garbage social media algorithms threw at them to make the tech billionaires richer. It’s atrociously unjustifiable, and no kid deserves it.
But as long as they have that smartphone in their hand – with or without parental controls – some risk is still there.
I’m actually not here to shame and blame. Why should I, if you know no better? I’m here because I’m afraid for my peers who’ve been dropped in shark-infested waters with no way of getting themselves out. 
Every kid deserves better. Still, only a precious few adults seem to accept why giving a teen the latest version of the iPhone is a poor idea. 
Lawmakers, it would significantly help parents to have an age 18 minimum law on social media use. Start treating social media like cigarettes and every other addictive product on the market.
Parents, you have the authority to remove what’s essentially a drug. You owe it to your child to do so. The prospect may be scary: denying any addict their drug is formidable. But difficulty has never been an excuse to ignore convalescence. And when caregivers begin to act based on fear of their child’s backlash, they’re not putting the child’s best interests first.
But why let a child experiment with a drug at all? Trust me as a teen with no social media or video games: I’m not left out of anything worth my time, and my health isn’t being risked to “fit in.” I have a perfectly functional landline. 
Children don’t need smart devices. Children need childhood, crucial elements of which are eliminated when they’re given digital products that are addictive by design. 
My peers need you to say “no” to these products, like you would to drugs and alcohol. We need to be able to trust that you’ll keep us from harm. But how can we, while one of the most addictive products on the market is what you’ve put under the Christmas tree for your 14-year-old? How can we, while you almost consistently choose satisfying children’s desires over caring for them responsibly? 
But you can make change. Minors need you to, because the movement we have already isn’t enough.
We need you to say “no.” The alternative price is your child.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)Six days after a senior official at the Food and Drug Administration sent a sweeping internal email claiming that covid vaccines had caused the deaths of “at least 10 children,” 12 former FDA commissioners released an extraordinary warning in the Dec. 3 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
They wrote that the claims and policy changes in the memo from Vinay Prasad, the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose “a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security” and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.
What is unfolding inside the FDA is not a narrow dispute over covid vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system — how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.

Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. “Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it,” he wrote, telling employees the agency’s mission, and its “worldview,” would change.
Prasad’s email reopened old arguments about covid vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that FDA staff had found “at least 10” deaths in children that happened “after and because of” covid vaccination, using reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.
On Substack, Inside Medicine reported Dec. 11 that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from covid shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, “The FDA’s investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there’s no final count yet of those deaths.”
Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have “harmed more children than we saved,” adding that “we do not know if we saved lives on balance.”
By comparison, more than 2,100 American children died of covid itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.
Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about covid vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.
Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it’s unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.

“There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.
Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an “evidence-based catastrophe,” questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new “worldview” and said anyone who disagreed with his “core principles” should resign.
The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to covid to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.
“This is really different. And it’s really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions,” former FDA commissioner Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad’s proposed policies — which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist — could shake the entire vaccine market.
“The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.,” he said. If the proposals advance, he added, “it won’t be a viable business.”
Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: “The American people deserve evidence-based science. Prasad’s email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children’s deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate.”
For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad’s ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.
Fueling Parental Doubt
Prasad’s memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children’s deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an “early warning system” for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.
“VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies,” said Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.
Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.
“Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence,” said Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
Prasad’s framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.
Experts fear this doubt won’t stay limited to covid vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA’s honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough — shots that have protected children for decades.
“Science must be transparent,” Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. “There’s a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that’s not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet.”
Delicate Vaccine Pipeline
Prasad’s new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, “would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses.”
For fast-changing viruses like flu and covid, this could be disastrous. There’s simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.
There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.
‘Checks and Balances’
Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad’s memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks “unethical” and “illegal.”
Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA’s Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. “If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest,” she said.
Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. “You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible,” said Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the covid pandemic.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1140192021-1024x7371744799798-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 07:11:40.700920

(photo submitted).During the upcoming spring semester, University of Missouri sophomore Cade Carman will spend a lot of his time in the state Capitol Building as a student intern.
Over summer break, Carman will head to Washington, D.C., on a scholarship to enhance his study of political science. And while he’s there, he’ll get to spend time with the biggest contributor to his education, Yasmine Arrington Brooks, founder of ScholarCHIPS, which provides grants to aid children with incarcerated parents.
Carman, who grew up in Ralls County, saved his money from helping on the family farm and jobs with the Army Corps of Engineers and a private marina at Mark Twain Lake. But without the $3,500 of annual aid and $1,000 allowance for books, he said, he wouldn’t be studying at the Columbia campus.
“This was by far the biggest scholarship I received,” Carman said in a recent interview with The Independent. “It’s a huge reason why I’m even here at all.”
Carman, who received his award in 2024, is the first of seven ScholarCHIPS scholars from outside the Washington-Northern Virginia area. The program expanded with support from Securus Technologies, a company that contracts with the Missouri Department of Corrections to provide communication services like telephone calls and email over a tablet provided to each person serving a sentence.
At the end of 2023, Brooks said, ScholarCHIPS ships was named a CNN hero for its focus on supporting children of people serving prison sentences. The relationship with Securus came soon after.
“That was the first time that ScholarCHIPS was put on a national stage, and we were starting to get inquiries and letters and postcards from people across the country,” Brooks said. “I just felt like it was a good time to open up our eligibility.”
The key eligibility criteria is pretty simple: Applicants must be the child of someone who is now or has been incarcerated and have a demonstrated financial need. The application window for 2026 scholarships opens in January.
Carman’s mother is serving a 10-year sentence for assault. She told him about the grant program after seeing an ad for it on the tablet computer provided to each inmate by Securus.
“She called me up one day and she said, ‘you know, I think you should apply for this. It looks like a pretty good program. And you might get it,’” Carman said. “And so then that’s exactly what I did.”
He sees his mother one or two times each month, Carman said. She won’t be released in time to see him graduate in 2028, he said.
He’s studying political science with a goal of attending law school after graduation.

“I’ve really always been interested in politics and civics education,” he said. “I like to study history, and so that kind of plays into it a lot.”
The need to make sure students like Carman can attend college is immense, Brooks said. She was raised by her grandmother, she said, and her father has been incarcerated for most of her life.
When she was a junior in high school, she said, she enrolled in a program provided by LearnServe International to develop a community-focused service project. She started with a big problem, mass incarceration, she said.
“I ended up narrowing my focus down to the effects of parental incarceration on children and families,” Brooks said.
Then, while seeking financial aid for college, her grandmother observed that there were no niche programs targeting those children.
“At that time, the statistic was that over 2 million young people in the United States have had an incarcerated parent at some time in their lives,” Brooks said, “and so that turned on a light bulb for me.”
When the time came to present her idea, she said, the judges were so impressed they suggested she create a not-for-profit organization to provide it.
“I do call it a ‘Shark Tank’ for teenagers, but it wasn’t as cutthroat,” she said of the presentation.
The scholarship program isn’t only for elite students — the minimum GPA is 2.5 — but applicants must show their ability and describe what they intend to do with the money in a series of three essays. One essay must discuss the impact of having an incarcerated parent.
“We’re definitely looking for achievers,” Brooks said. “We’re looking for young people who demonstrate the potential to excel in college and be successful and graduate from college.”
Carman impressed judges with his work ethic and his essays, Brooks said.
“He’s a great writer. He’s a great communicator,” she said. “And when we interviewed him, I just fell in love with him.”
In most years, ScholarCHIPS gave eight or fewer awards, depending on financial support, Brooks said. After the recognition from CNN and help from Securus, she decided to use reserves to award 24 grants in 2024, continue to increase the fund’s profile, and hope for the best to finance students throughout their college career.
“What I really wanted to do with this large cohort was to show the need, and also expand the diversity of scholars that we support,” Brooks said.
But the past year hasn’t been as strong as she hoped, she said, with some donors pulling out for a variety of reasons including losing their jobs in the federal government during cutbacks. 
“Anything that we thought was predictable has become unpredictable,” Brooks said. “ And we’ve communicated that with our scholars, including Cade and they’ve been extremely patient and understanding with us.”
Securus has 500,000 tablets in the hands of people incarcerated in 48 of the 50 states. It is the first — and so far the only — major corrections contractor that supports the scholarship fund.
Securus sees the contribution as an investment in the families using its communication services, Margita Thompson, chief corporate affairs officer, said in a statement to The Independent.
A ScholarCHIPS graduate who worked with Securus as a student intern is now employed by the company, she said. The support for seven scholars helps elevate ScholarCHIPS visibility and impact, she added.
“Education is a proven pathway to upward mobility, especially for children of incarcerated parents who face additional barriers,” Thompson said. “Supporting ScholarCHIPS extends that commitment to the next generation.”
Carman graduated high school in a class of 52 and is one of only a handful who are attending college, he said. His rural roots and work for the Corps of Engineers initially had him thinking he would pursue a career in environmental law, he said.
Now he’s not so sure, he said, adding that he’s also thinking about beginning his career as a public defender.
“With everything with my mom, it kind of introduced me to the criminal justice system, which I previously didn’t have a whole lot of interaction with,” Carman said. “It helped me better understand a lot of the problems inside the system.”

Looks to me like it’s got a new twist on the challenges of 2025, at least when it comes to AI.
“AI,” in case you’ve just awakened from 12 years in a coma, does not stand for a spicy alcoholic drink called “Avocado Inferno.” It’s short for Artificial Intelligence — sort of like the HAL 9000 talking computer in “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
A lot of people have strong opinions about the use of AI and what effect it’s having on education in particular and society in general. But what I want to talk about is how much the surging demand for something artificial is imperiling something very real: our water.
People in Palm Beach County found out recently about plans to build a huge AI data center on 202 acres in Loxahatchee. A lot of those people looked at the project and echoed HAL 9000 by saying: “I’m sorry, I can’t do that.”
A Change.org petition opposing the project drew more than 7,000 signatures in just a month.
The zoning for Project Tango, as it’s known (more on why in a minute) was first approved 10 years ago, long before AI became the flashpoint it is now. But the project’s developer recently sought to expand that zoning to include another 64 acres, which is what tipped off everyone to what was going on.
Mark Offerman via subject
“It wasn’t on anybody’s radar,” Mark Offerman, president of the Palm Beach County Environmental Alliance, told me.
Once they realized what was happening, people turned out in force to tell the Palm Beach County Commission to say no. The Dec. 10 commission meeting, according to WLRN-FM, featured “hours of emotional public comment from more than 50 residents worried about nonstop low-frequency hums, heavy water consumption, and long-term environmental impacts.”
They won — temporarily. But this is just one salvo in a war that’s starting to break out across the state.
A sidestep for Tango
Most of what I know about robots I learned from reading Isaac Aimov and watching “The Terminator.” But AI use has gone far beyond what science fiction envisioned.
Now people are turning to AI for assistance with everything from combating drug abuse to helping human fertility. Heck, you can’t even do a Google search now without tripping over an AI summary of questionable accuracy.
Turns out AI has a pretty bad track record when it comes to reflecting the real world. For proof, I refer you to the many court cases — including one in a Florida criminal case — in which attorneys filed motions written using AI. These lazy limabeans then wound up in hot water because their AI-written motions turned out to contain more fiction than Stephen King’s computer drive.
Stories like that are the reason Merriam-Webster chose “slop” — the mess left behind by careless use of AI — as its “Word of the Year.”
Yet the Florida Legislature, perhaps because it produces so much of its own kind of slop, feels a tremendous deference toward the big-money corporations pushing any sort of development. That’s why they allow these companies to hide their identities.
“State law allows the potential end-user’s identity to be shielded from public records,” Stet News reported. The supposed justification for the secrecy is “to improve the state’s competitive edge.” The fact that it prevents the neighbors from finding out who wants to move in and ruin the neighborhood is just too bad, I guess.
This explains why Palm Beach County officials are calling this AI data center “Project Tango” — apparently a reference to how they’re allowed to use fancy footwork to side-step the Sunshine Law.
To make matters worse, the Project Tango expansion first surfaced on the county commission’s consent agenda.
That’s supposed to be for uncontested items. Scheduling something controversial for the consent agenda is hardly a 2026 trick. It’s more of a throwback to the 1960s.
Fortunately, the anti-AI public showed up for real.
Once in a generation
The growing demand for AI is driving the growth of new AI data centers. As a result, data centers are popping up around the state like mushrooms after a hard rain.
A search of the website “datacenters.com” turns up 139 of them in Florida already, mostly in such urban locations as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville.
Sites in more rural areas can sometimes make sense. In June, the Fort Meade City Commission approved a zoning change on 1,164 acres in Polk County to build an AI data center. That land used to be a phosphate mine. Given the environmental track record of phosphate mining, an AI data center could be an improvement.
But others are clearly not compatible with their neighborhood. Take the one that was proposed last fall on a former citrus grove in St. Lucie County.
“Sentinel Grove would be one of the largest data centers in the world, both by area and by energy consumption,” TCPalm.com reported in October. “The 1,218‑acre site would house up to 15 million square feet — more than 260 football fields — of computer systems, server racks and other data-center infrastructure across several buildings.”
Company officials called it “a once-in-a-generation economic project for St. Lucie County.” But the county didn’t agree.
St. Lucie County’s planning and zoning commission voted 4-2 to recommend against approving development, citing concerns of stormwater runoff, construction traffic, and urban sprawl.
“I just can’t even understand it, or see it, or compartmentalize that building being out in the middle of that area,” one of the commission members said.
The recommendation has yet to go before the full county commission. Instead, the developer is now “engaging with surrounding residents and property owners and exploring potential refinements” to the proposal, according to Benjamin Balcer, director of Planning and Zoning Services for St. Lucie County.
Or consider one proposed last year for Osceola County, near Yeehaw Junction (which I always feel compelled to mention was originally named “Jackass Junction” until our prissy DOT made them change it).
The project calls for “nine data center buildings, each three stories with 675,000 square feet and an adjacent equipment yard, for over 7 million square feet,” according to the Orlando Sentinel, which called it “slightly smaller than the world’s largest data center.”
To say this one would not fit with its neighbors is an understatement. It’s next door to the 27,000-acre DeLuca Preserve, one of the state’s largest nature preserves and crucial habitat for the endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow.
A million noisy computers
One of the people I talked to for this column knows a lot about AI data centers because he’s built some. It’s the reason why he opposes the one proposed for Palm Beach County.
Rudolph Tinker via Linkedin
Rudolph Tinker is a political science professor at Palm Beach State College and a licensed general contractor. One of the main problems with such centers, he said, is the noise.
“It’s like having your computer running, but you’ve got a million of them,” he explained.
To have such a tremendous number of components at work inevitably produces a tremendous amount of heat, he told me. Cooling things down requires millions of gallons of water.
“The water consumption by this plant is going to be tremendous,” he predicted.
The bipartisan Environmental and Energy Study Institute reports that AI data centers “can consume up to 5 million gallons per day, equivalent to the water use of a town populated by 10,000 to 50,000 people.” That’s more than 1 billion gallons a year.
Fresh drinking water is in increasingly short supply in this state, to the point that some places are calling for moratoriums on new connections. To let one factory slurp up more than 1 billion gallons every year seems absurdly excessive.
The plant’s electric consumption will be huge as well, Tinker predicted.
“As artificial intelligence data centers multiply across the state,” Medium reported in July, “their voracious appetite for power and water is triggering costly infrastructure upgrades and rate increases that are quietly being passed on to Floridians’ household budgets.”
Drew Martin via Sierra Club
In fact, Drew Martin of the Sierra Club’s Loxahatchee chapter predicted Project Tango will drive up electrical rates for everyone in the county. It doesn’t help that the nearest power plant runs on polluting natural gas, not clean solar power.
Even worse, the location chosen by whoever is behind Project Tango is right next door to the environmentally friendly Arden community, said Offerman of the Palm Beach County Environmental Alliance. The Arden residents were flabbergasted to see they would be on the front lines of the AI battle and fought back hard.
“A facility of this magnitude — operating around the clock with massive electrical usage, water demands, and constant mechanical systems — does not belong anywhere near these homes, farms, or equestrian properties,” one Arden resident wrote to county commissioners. She warned that “Project Tango will permanently alter the character of the region.”
As another Arden resident told the Palm Beach County Zoning Commission: “If you actually ask AI if it’s good to live next to a data center, it will tell you absolutely no.”
An unlikely ally
The zoning commissioners voted 7-2 to say yes to Project Tango, even though the project manager said they were only beginning to study the noise problem and the water usage. Despite Tango doing things backward, the zoning officials were ready to dance with them like Ginger Rogers matching steps with Fred Astaire.
But at the Palm Beach County Commission meeting, the commissioners looked at the angry crowd, listened to their objections — and pushed pause.
Instead of voting to halt the project, they voted to postpone any decision until April. That would give the company time to do all the studies that its project manager had promised.
Still, at least one commissioner got the message.
Maria Sachs via Palm Beach County Commission
“I want to reject the whole application,” said Commissioner Maria Sachs.
We’ll find out in a few months whether Sachs’ colleagues will see the light the way she did. In the meantime, the people opposed to this project picked up an unlikely ally.
I hope you’re sitting down. The ally’s name is Gov. Ron DeSantis. No, I’m not kidding. In early December, DeSantis announced he wants the Legislature to enact what he called “an AI Bill of Rights.”
Most of it involves children and chatbots, but there are two provisions of interest to the folks in Loxahatchee: giving local governments explicit permission to reject AI data centers and forbidding the data centers from being built in agricultural areas.
Gov. Ron DeSantis announcing an AI BIll of Rights via governor’s office
DeSantis has been on the wrong side of virtually every important environmental issue since he took office. I’m talking about everything from water pollution and toxic algae blooms to Everglades restoration and removal of the Rodman reservoir. Heck, this is the guy who thought it would be a nifty idea to put golf courses in the state parks!
But on this one point, he’s got a point. AI data centers are water-draining, energy-sucking polluters that drive up power bills and drive down residential property values. Local governments should be allowed to say no to them, period.
During the first of a series of legislative committee hearings on AI last month, one industry executive admitted that his colleagues know they’re about as welcome in Florida residential communities as a burning bag of dog poop on the porch.
“To say that data centers are unpopular right now is probably an understatement, to say the least,” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.
Nevertheless, they’re pushing these unpopular projects because they can rake in millions of dollars.
Here’s my proposed New Year’s resolution: Let’s pass a law that says any company that wants to build a massive AI data center in an area not zoned for industry can get a green light only if they put up a bond.
The bond has to cover any damage done — to the water supply, the energy grid, breathability of the air, you name it. The amount would be at least $10 million, with the cost higher for larger projects.
I think even HAL 9000 would tell you that was fair.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Arden-clubhouse-via-Arden-website.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 07:11:40.700920

The president’s pursuit of energy dominance – despite the U.S. producing record levels of energy in 2024  – and his declaration of a widely disputed energy emergency sparked concerns among environmentalists and supporters of clean energy. 
These moves also brought movement in the battle against Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, the state’s efforts to move away from coal power and encouraged the build out of data centers – which have faced widespread pushback from communities throughout the state. 
With those stories in mind, the Advance is looking back on its biggest environmental stories of 2025.

Data centers draw the ire of residents across the state

As a state law offering tax breaks on data center construction and equipment took effect earlier this year, tech companies are flocking to Michigan in hopes of building out additional facilities to advance artificial intelligence development while communities are increasingly pushing back against these projects.
In the past month, frustration from residents against the lack of transparency into many of these deals – with local officials and landowners bound by non-disclosure agreements – has hit a fever pitch with a few hundred residents gathering at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to push back against these developments. 
While regulations specific to data centers are limited to the conditions for receiving the tax break, lawmakers are stepping up to address their constituents’ concerns, with a bipartisan group of House representatives introducing legislation to repeal the tax breaks for these resource-intensive facilities. 
Another group of lawmakers in the Senate has put forth regulations to bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use from obtaining a water withdrawal permit, require the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish reports on data centers’ energy and water use and ensure residents don’t bear the cost of upgrading water systems to serve these facilities.
 
Line 5 lawsuits continue as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expedites review of tunnel project

Following a years-long legal battle over whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case to remove Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline from the Great Lakes should be heard in state or federal courts, the case returned to the Ingham County’s 30th Judicial Circuit Court in Lansing at the start of the year. 
The United States Supreme Court has also agreed to hear an appeal of the decision that sent the case back to Michigan in the first place.
Additionally, attorneys for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether the state is immune from legal action for its decision to revoke Enbridge’s easement to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet.
A decision to take up this case could carry even further weight, with a federal judge barring the state from enforcing its notice terminating Enbridge’s easement to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes. 
In yet another legal challenge before the Michigan Supreme Court, justices agreed to review whether the Michigan Public Service Commission – which oversees siting matters for pipelines within the state – erred in its decision to issue one of the permits needed for Enbridge to begin construction on its tunnel project. 
The state’s highest court will hear two challenges, one filed by FLOW Water Advocates, and another filed by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs, including the Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center.
Opponents argue the commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac.
Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers’ long awaited environmental impact statement assessing the plan to replace the two segments of pipeline located in the Straits with a new segment placed in a tunnel embedded into the bedrock beneath the lake was issued in May. 
An executive order issued by the Trump Administration in January has also permitted the project’s environmental review to move forward under a shortened timeline.
 
EPA lifts emergency order on Flint water, residents mark milestones on lead line replacement

More than 11 years after the beginning of the Flint Water Crisis, the United States Environmental Protection Agency lifted its emergency order on the city’s drinking water, which was put in place in 2016. 
However, community members were quick to note that the decision, which came alongside the end of the city’s lead line replacement program, does not mean that the city’s pipes are lead free. 
While Flint and the state of Michigan have met their obligations under a 2017 settlement requiring them to replace all lead lines in the city, several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes. Additionally, not all residents have agreed to have their homes checked or their pipes replaced.
The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Residents who need their lead lines replaced can call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.
The city’s recovery could also be hampered by a loss in funding, as Michigan House Republicans voted to eliminate $8.3 million in funding to support services across the city, as the water crisis continues to impact residents and children.

In West Michigan, the first nuclear plant restart in the nation has entered its final phase, with plans to bring two small modular reactors online at the same site.
While the plant has not yet returned to energy production, it has been cleared to bring new fuel on site. 
However, a host of anti-nuclear groups continue to raise concerns about the safety of the restart, with a trio of organizations filing a federal lawsuit arguing the plant is legally barred from resuming operations after entering decommissioning status.
 
Energy emergency draws challenge from Michigan AG

Campbell coal plant in Port Sheldon Township to close. [ONN photo/Dirk Wierenga]Since its issuance on Jan. 20, the Trump Administration’s energy emergency order has drawn criticism from environmentalists across the nation, alongside a legal challenge from Michigan’s attorney general. 
Despite record breaking energy production in 2024, the Trump administration has proclaimed the nation’s energy resources to be insufficient, though Nessel and Democratic attorneys general from 14 other states are arguing the order is unlawful.
In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, and that the administration’s move to fast track permits for several activities tied to energy production undermine the rights of the states.
Alongside fast tracking the environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project, the Trump Administration has used the order as a justification to repeatedly extend operations at a West Michigan Coal plant that was slated to close at the end of May. 
According to the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million between the initial extension issued on May 23, and Sept. 30. The latest extension, issued on Nov. 18, will keep the plant operating through Feb. 17, 2026. Nessel has challenged the extension.
 
Trump commits to supporting project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes

A decades-long project aimed at keeping invasive carp from establishing a foothold in the Great Lakes, secured support from the White House in May, following efforts from the Whitmer administration to ensure the project would receive funding allocated under former President Joe Biden’s administration. 
The $1.15 billion dollar project, which secured its first construction contract in December 2024, is a joint effort sponsored by Michigan, Illinois and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The project targets a critical choke point near Joliet, Ill., instituting a series of deterrents to keep invasive carp and other nuisance species out of the Great Lakes. 
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that the carp could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region – including rivers and inland lakes – alongside  the region’s $20 billion fishing and boating industries.

House Constitution Chairman Price Wallace, a Republican from Mendenhall, and Senate Elections Chairman Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, told Mississippi Today that they will likely file bills to give Mississippians a way to circumvent the Legislature and place issues on a statewide ballot. 
“It’s important,” England said. “It’s important for the people to feel like ‘If our Legislature is not reacting to things we want, then we want to have this process available to us.’”

Mississippians had the constitutional right to a ballot initiative starting in 1914, but the state Supreme Court threw it out in 1922. The initiative went dormant until the Legislature and voters restored the right by passing a measure in 1992, allowing voters to amend the state constitution. But the Supreme Court again nullified it on technical grounds in 2021 in a ruling on a lawsuit over voters passing a medical marijuana initiative.
Ever since the Mississippi Supreme Court invalidated the ballot initiative then, legislators have been unable to reach a consensus on how to restore the right to voters. 
Since the court’s ruling, some lawmakers have questioned whether Mississippi needs an initiative and raised concerns that uber-wealthy out-of-state special interests can manipulate voters through ballot initiatives. 
To assuage these concerns, Senate leaders have proposed a new initiative process that requires petitioners to collect a larger number of voters’ signatures to have something placed on a ballot than in the previous process. 
“The process should be difficult because it goes around and goes outside our constitutional republic system of government,” England said. 
House leaders, on the other hand, have pushed for an initiative process similar to the previous one. Last year,  Rep. Wallace advocated for a process that required petitioners to gather around 140,000 signatures before it could be considered on the ballot. 
But the Simpson County Republican said he hopes lawmakers could work constructively this year to find some common ground on how to restore the process. 
“We’re all going to work on something,” Wallace said. 
Both House and Senate leaders agree that a new initiative process should only allow voters to make changes to state law, not the Constitution, and not allow voters to propose initiatives related to abortion and the public pension system. 
During the 30 years that the state had an initiative, only seven proposals made it to a statewide ballot: two initiatives for term limits, eminent domain reform, voter ID, a personhood amendment, medical marijuana, and a measure requiring lawmakers to fully fund public education.
Of those seven, only eminent domain, voter ID and medical marijuana were approved by voters. The rest were rejected.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11114638/3X0A7482-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 07:11:40.700920

From breaking news to deeply reported features and investigations, VTDigger’s journalism followed the issues shaping life in the state. Here’s what resonated with readers most.
More than 400,000 readers checked out our most-read story of 2025: Carly Berlin and Greta Solsaa’s intimate look at the hundreds of Vermonters forced out of housing when the state’s motel voucher program expired in July. The reporting humanized the policy shift, and its impact resonated widely.
Solsaa was also behind the second-most read story of the year, covering the protest sparked by Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Vermont in March. Earlier reporting by former intern Klara Bauters on Vance’s planned visit similarly drew heavy readership. 
Education coverage drew strong attention as well. Readers closely followed stories about the federal government withholding funds from Vermont schools and a controversial — and later reversed — Vermont Agency of Education directive that would have required school districts to certify compliance with a federal order banning what it described as “illegal” diversity, equity and inclusion-related programs. A local story about the South Burlington School District superintendent resigning following allegations of creating a toxic work environment also interested readers.
Public safety coverage ranked among the year’s most-read topics. Coverage by Alan Keays, Habib Sabet, Ethan Weinstein and Paul Heintz of the January fatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agent and a second person during a traffic stop in the Northeast Kingdom on the day President Donald Trump was inaugurated drew widespread interest. 
Environmental reporting resonated strongly, particularly Olivia Geiger’s coverage on states challenging Vermont’s Climate Superfund Law, K. Figenbaum’s reporting on rising brook trout populations and Solsaa’s examination of  Vermonters’ reactions to the Trump administration’s push for expanded logging in national forests. 
Readers also connected with Austyn Gaffney’s feature on the foreclosure of a century-old Norwich dairy farm and Kevin O’Connor’s remembrance of a 102-year-old Vermont World War II veteran. 
Other widely read stories included Peter D’Auria’s reporting on Vermont prisons being locked down in March as corrections staff searched for weapons and contraband, as well as several stories by intern Henry Fernandez examining the fallout from Gardener’s Supply’s bankruptcy, flooding in the NEK and Addison County and a Central Vermont business nonprofit leader being placed on leave pending an investigation.

Reporters also reflected on the stories that stayed with them most this year and why those pieces were especially meaningful to report. Here are some of their reflections.
Kevin O’Connor
As Vermont communities marked the anniversaries of the devastating floods of 2023 and 2024, O’Connor reported on how towns continued to struggle in 2025 with nearly $1 billion in estimated statewide damage, struggling to finance repairs while still rebuilding. He also covered Vermont’s ongoing battle with drug dependence, highlighting community-level efforts and profiling a Vermonter who moved from addiction and desperation to becoming part of a local solution. 
Shaun Robinson
Robinson’s reporting on behind-the-scenes political maneuvering that threatened a package of election law reforms was credited with contributed to the legislation’s passage. He also held elected officials accountable through records-based reporting, including stories revealing gaps in U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s public portrayal of her corporate fundraising and documenting how state Sen. Russ Ingalls switched all of the newscasts on his newly purchased radio stations in the Northeast Kingdom to Fox News. 
Greta Solsaa
Through a monthslong investigation, Solsaa worked with nursing home advocates, state officials and public records to uncover a pattern of care problems at some of Vermont’s most troubled nursing homes under new ownership. Her reporting traced the issues in part to a temporary state approval process that lacked transparency and failed to prevent problems. Solsaa also highlighted her on-the-ground reporting during Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Vermont, when national and international attention focused on Vermonters’ responses to President Donald Trump’s second election and the direction of his administration.
Corey McDonald
McDonald’s coverage of K–12 education reform captured a year marked by both uncertainty and optimism, as communities weighed the promise of Act 73 against fears about the future of local schools. Early reporting on the issue foreshadowed debates that would dominate the year. He also cited a memorable story from a Burlington Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting, where residents and city officials confronted the difficult realities of the city’s overdose and substance use crisis and debated whether an overdose prevention center could help.
Alan Keays
Keays highlighted reporting that brought new transparency to long-hidden information, including a secret report detailing police actions leading up to the death of a young Rutland City police trainee. He also pointed to a story that offered readers a deeper look into the drunken driving arrest of Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos.
Ethan Weinstein
Weinstein described his reporting on immigration enforcement as especially memorable, noting that internal communications from Vermont prison officials helped illuminate how ICE uses the state’s prisons and why that arrangement has created challenges for Vermont. He also pointed to a story examining the widespread problems caused by remote court hearings, which relied heavily on the perspectives of incarcerated people and revealed a largely unseen part of the justice system.
K. Figenbaum
Figenbaum pointed to a deep dive into why Greensboro voters rejected an affordable housing proposal for their town hall, a story that reflected broader trends facing communities statewide. Another favorite focused on a Vermont Fish & Wildlife project that began in the Northeast Kingdom and has since expanded across the state, the country and into Canada, improving fish populations while boosting flood resilience.
Theo Wells-Spackman
Wells-Spackman cited a story about the Holland food shelf, which was able to remain open thanks to an extraordinarily generous donation from a VTDigger reader after reading his piece.

Vance at the Nebraska Republican Party booth at the Nebraska State Fair on Aug 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Like the last time President Donald Trump was in office, the White House and its political movement have influenced Nebraska’s political landscape and its top political stories of 2025, but not always to its liking. 
Nebraskans will see crops of national politicians, consultants and reporters visit. Reporters have already started coming, from Lexington to McCook. 
Once again, Trump motivates all sides.
Some of Trump’s agenda has directly affected the state, including the state budget, with lawmakers facing a projected $471 million deficit tied partly to changes made by a federal tax and spending bill the president calls “big” and “beautiful.” Gov. Jim Pillen has told the agencies under his control that he plans to balance the budget largely by cutting $500 million in state spending.
Nebraska has seen its economy face headwinds in 2025 that appear to be leveling out. Trump’s trade wars have had an economic impact, with Nebraska farmers bracing for another tough year, plagued by low corn and soybean prices. The Trump administration is trying to ease some of the disruption with $12 billion in ag-focused aid.

The president’s push for deportations also reached Nebraska, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha sent people to a North Platte jail. The raids spurred protests in the state’s two largest cities.
And Trump’s hold on GOP politics has influenced decisions made by top state officials, including the governor, who visited Washington, D.C. relentlessly. He matters in a state where Republicans hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage. 
As with most midterm elections, this year’s results could hinge on how people think the president, governor and party in power are handling things. 
The 2026 midterms start early
The Cornhusker State is used to national political attention in the competitive Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. But the spotlight on the slightly right-leaning swing district is brighter with Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring. He decided last summer not to seek reelection. 
Bacon, who often criticized Trump but typically voted with Republicans, fended off Democratic challengers for nearly a decade as the district became a “blue dot” in the Electoral College, electing Trump once in 2016 and rejecting him in 2020 and 2024.  
Bacon told reporters he could win re-election but said it’s time for “a new Republican” to win and hold the seat. Two Republicans are vying for the nomination.

But losing the incumbent advantage has local and national political experts viewing the 2nd District as a possible pickup opportunity for Democrats. That optimism is reflected in the number of Democratic candidates running, six.
Nebraska Democratic leaders, speaking during a visit to Omaha by former President Joe Biden, pointed to John Ewing Jr.’s mayoral win last year over three-time incumbent GOP Mayor Jean Stothert as the latest evidence of the kind of blue “wave” Democrats hope is coming in 2026. Even the 1st Congressional District in eastern Nebraska has a Democratic primary.
Another Nebraska race drawing an unusual number of national eyeballs is the U.S. Senate race between U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and former labor union leader Dan Osborn, who is running as a nonpartisan. 


Among Nebraska’s top political stories from 2025

U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., retires, and the fight to replace him in NE-02 heats up.

Nebraska’s state budget faces another projected deficit in 2026 after budget cuts, fund transfers in 2025.



Osborn gained national attention for his 2024 bid against Nebraska’s senior senator, U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., whose six percentage point win was closer than expected. He has built a brand around his Navy veteran hat and flannel shirts, fed in part by hosting meet-and-greets in bars across Nebraska.
Osborn argues Washington, D.C., and Nebraska have forgotten working people and serve donors and special interests. He argues, among other things, that unions need federal help to protect workers’ rights and wants to make the tax code fairer. 
Ricketts has emphasized his conservative record of service, including two spending restraint-driven terms as governor until Pillen appointed him to the seat in 2023. Ricketts won a special election in 2024 to serve Sasse’s final two years.
The race has already been heated, with both campaigns wasting no opportunity to trade blows. 
Ricketts and his team have tried framing Osborn as a “fake independent,” pointing to Osborn receiving donations and support from Democrats and using fundraising infrastructure that’s often used by Democrats and criticizing him paying himself and his wife — which is legal.
Osborn has said Ricketts represents the people and corporate interests that the current “rigged” system tilted towards.
State budget woes
During this year’s legislative session, some Nebraska lawmakers embraced culture wars, while others pushed back against new voter-approved laws. 
GOP majorities in the Legislature, often with gubernatorial support and at least one Democratic lawmaker, tried to slow voter-approved increases in the minimum wage. And a bipartisan group of senators fought over whether legislation was needed to help implement legalizing medical cannabis. 
But the main story of the last legislative session is likely to be repeated in 2026, work to fill a state budget deficit that at one point grew to $432 million. After making numerous cuts senators acknowledged as painful, the session concluded with the state’s two-year budget projecting a modest $4 million surplus.
The surplus didn’t last. New economic projections made in July put Nebraska back into a deficit. When Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board met again in October, projections brought the expected shortfall to $471 million.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is expected to cost Nebraska’s state government about $406 million over the next four fiscal years, according to the state Department of Revenue.
Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista told the Examiner, “There is the budget, and then there’s everything else.” His top priority is filling the budget hole by Day 50 of the 60-day session that starts Jan. 7.
Other political issues that lawmakers will likely face include the possible expulsion of a senator, discord over the repurposing of a state prison facility into an ICE detention center and a continued push for property tax relief. 
Last year and this, Pillen has made offsetting property taxes with broadened sales taxes a centerpiece of his agenda, including a special session that took a different approach.  
His preferred approach faces an uphill climb this year, with four Republican lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Unicameral pledging not to raise taxes during the 2026 session. They argue spending should be cut.
That could set up an interesting dynamic in the governor’s race.
Trump and the Nebraska Governor’s Mansion 
One of the biggest subplots of the 2026 governor’s race reared its head early and often in 2025, the prospect of Pillen facing a potential GOP primary race rematch with multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster, a longtime donor of Trump’s.
Herbster lost to Pillen in the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary, finishing second in a three-way race that also included then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd District. 
Herbster is expected to decide whether to run again as early as this month. But this time, unlike 2022, Herbster will have to run without Trump’s endorsement. Former Democratic State Sen. Lynne Walz is also exploring a bid.
Pillen secured Trump’s endorsement in November after visiting the White House at least nine times in 2025.  Political strategist Perre Neilan of the Neilan Strategy Group in Lincoln has called the Trump endorsement a “big get” in a GOP primary.

Herbster told the Examiner that “Pillen’s shortcomings make it hard to say no” to running in 2026 and that he will decide closer to the new year. The businessman said that while he is disappointed in Trump’s endorsement, he said, “It is entirely reasonable that he would endorse the incumbent Republican governor.” 
Pillen told Politico that the 2022 GOP race is “history.” He told the Lincoln Journal Star that the ICE facility and other ways he supports Trump aren’t politically motivated. 
Pillen tried unsuccessfully to push Winner-Take-All in the statehouse again this year, a change Trump has personally supported on social media despite lacking the votes to pass in the Legislature. He has praised Trump repeatedly since his return to the presidency. Trump’s White House also quietly tried to push the state to consider mid-decade congressional redistricting, but failed to gain traction. 
The governor has stayed supportive of Trump’s approach to trade, which some in agriculture have criticized as economically disruptive.
Nebraska, under Pillen, volunteered to be the first state in the country to implement new federal work requirements for Medicaid recipients, beginning May 1 of this year. 
Pillen administration staffers initiated conversations with the federal government about the possibility of assisting ICE, offering a new migrant detention center at a state prison facility in McCook. 
McCook is now home to an ICE facility that aims to be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement, though its small capacity shows it is “largely symbolic.” 
Whether or not Nebraska politics is ready, the national eyeballs are coming.

Hand-crafted gifts keep a faithful domestic servant humming, writes columnist David Romtvedt.
The post The refrigerator and resisting planned obsolescence appeared first on WyoFile .","Whenever I go away for more than a few days I come home to find something broken. The cable over the spring-loaded pulley that allows the garage door to open and close somehow tangled itself up in my absence, so the door was stuck. The storm door was missing a pane of glass, maybe attacked by the wind or an errant stone. A hinge had fallen off a cupboard door. The water faucet in the bathroom sink dripped. Or the bathtub faucet. Or the kitchen faucet. The drain in the basement was clogged and the floor covered in several inches of water. I turned the oven on and the element made a noise like pfs-zzt and went dead. Do these domestic objects miss me when I’m gone? Do they, as we all do, long for loving attention?

Opinion

Returning home from a trip a few years ago, I opened the refrigerator door and it flew away, both hinges having come undone in my absence so that it was held in place only by the magnetic insulating seals. I picked up the door along with everything that had flown out, turned off the refrigerator, emptied it, and began figuring out how to put things back together.
The refrigerator is a Danish model we bought 30 years ago. It’s tall and narrow with the upper two-thirds serving as the refrigerator and the lower third, the freezer. No bending over for things in the fridge, which is convenient. But the feature that really convinced us to buy it was dual compressors — one for the fridge and one for the freezer — which meant that the refrigerator-freezer unit would use less electricity, maintain more precise temperature control, and last longer than a similar unit with a single compressor.
Aside from the flying door, there is one other small problem — all the interior trays and compartments along with the handles to both the freezer and fridge are made of plastic. The lower tray inside the refrigerator door cracked first along both ends. The tray hung precariously out in space, bottles and jars leaning forward as if ready to launch themselves off a cliff and into the abyss below — the kitchen floor.
I slathered low-temperature glue along the broken edges of plastic then drilled small holes on either side of the split section and sewed the tray’s severed parts together using very light gauge woven wire. That worked for a good long time until the tray cracked in another spot. This time I drilled through the inside of the door and tray and wired the hanging section of tray to the door itself. It works great although it looks a bit like the stitching on Frankenstein’s forehead.
Then one day as I opened the fridge, the shiny white plastic door handle split much as the interior tray had — vertically from top to midway down its length. And on my return from my last trip — an entire month away — the freezer door handle split just as the fridge door handle had. I would have to make new handles for both doors. 
I went through my scrap lumber pile and found a relatively clean, smooth three-foot-long length of 1-by-4 finish-grade pine. To avoid possible splitting from the ends as I worked the wood, I drew a paper pattern of the handles and traced it in the center of the board’s length. Then came drawing, carving, cutting, drilling, sanding and oiling the wooden replacement handles. It’s the interior cut that’s the hardest. It took me several hours for each handle using my clumsy tools — a hand brace and bit that was my father’s, several chisels of various sizes, a hacksaw, and an electric drill, circular saw, and sander.
Perhaps you are wondering why I didn’t avoid all this home manufacturing and simply buy a replacement plastic tray and door handles. I’m guessing you know why. These parts are no longer available. You can’t buy the five-dollar tray or the seven-dollar molded plastic handles that allow you to open and close the doors of your $1,500 energy-efficient and long-lasting, dual-compressor refrigerator freezer. For 30 years, this faithful domestic servant has stood as a sentinel in our kitchen. Sewing up the tray and making wooden handles seemed the least I could do to show my gratitude. Little gifts to honor a machine that has served us so well and doesn’t deserve to be thrown away as just another victim of planned obsolescence.

Judges across Tennessee are now demanding greater accountability from people who have been ordered to give up their guns, a shift aimed at strengthening protections for domestic violence victims.
The change is being adopted county by county, after state lawmakers bowed to opposition from the National Rifle Association over a bill that would have taken that reform statewide.
The move follows reporting by WPLN and ProPublica over the past two years that found Tennessee’s lax gun laws and enforcement have allowed firearms to remain in dangerous hands. The state consistently has one of the highest rates of women killed by men, and most of those homicides are committed with guns. The news organizations’ analysis found that about 1 in 4 victims of domestic violence gun homicides were killed by someone who was barred from having a firearm.
In Tennessee, when someone is convicted of a domestic violence charge or is subject to an order of protection, they are not allowed to possess a gun. A person ordered to relinquish their firearm can turn it over to a third party, like a friend or relative, for safekeeping. But the state doesn’t require them to disclose whose hands the weapon ends up in. Advocates say that makes it hard to ensure that the guns were given up — and that they were given to someone who is legally allowed to hold on to them.
As part of its investigation, WPLN and ProPublica reported on an East Tennessee county that had transformed its justice system for domestic violence victims. Scott County’s reforms include a requirement that when a court is stripping domestic violence abusers of their guns, they must tell the court in a written affidavit who is going to take custody of their weapons. The county also asks for the address of that person, who is asked to sign an affidavit saying they are in receipt of the weapons. None of these extra measures of accountability, however, are required on the state’s standard gun-dispossession form.
“The [state’s] form is really incomplete,” said Becky Bullard with Nashville’s Office of Family Safety. “We can’t have someone dispossess of their firearm lawfully if we don’t know who they’re giving the gun to.”
At least nine counties, including Tennessee’s two largest, Davidson and Shelby, have amended the state’s gun dispossession affidavit to require information about who will be taking possession of the weapon. Other counties are also considering the change, advocates say.
“When I heard about what Scott County was doing, I was shocked,” said Shelby County Judge Greg Gilbert, who adjusted that court’s form when he found out that courts were able to do that themselves. “It does make it a little more likely that people will take this seriously.”
Last year, two Republican lawmakers introduced legislation that would have made Scott County’s form the default for the rest of the state, but the bill was pushed to 2026 after opposition from the Tennessee Firearms Association and the NRA. Neither association responded to requests for comment at the time. One of the lawmakers who introduced the bill, Sen. Becky Massey, a Knox County Republican, said she would move forward with the bill again if her House counterpart, Rep. Kelly Keisling, did. But Keisling, a Republican whose district includes Scott County, said he is “uncertain as to the future of this particular piece of legislation.”
This month, advocates for victims of domestic violence also pushed for a state council on domestic violence to recommend adoption of the amended form. That effort failed after a procedural mishap; the group plans to revisit the topic at its next meeting in March.
“We really do not have a minute to lose. This is a battle that we have been fighting around a form for years,” said Bullard, who has advocated for this reform since a deadly shooting in 2018 at a Waffle House where the man traveled with a gun that he was ordered to give up. “And it could affect someone in the next minute.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20240521-Kranitz-TNGunsRural-503-PDcrop_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-01 06:56:29.625232

It’s been a about two years since Army veteran James Watson moved into his neat, three-bedroom, traditional ranch-style home in southeast Raleigh.
On a visit in late February, the home, which Watson purchased through the Raleigh Area Land Trust, looked as though the proverbial GI party had taken place the night before — it was spotless and in perfect order.
The house was gutted and remodeled before Watson took ownership. He eagerly showed it off, first pointing out the modern kitchen, then taking a visitor to see each room. In a bedroom he uses for an office, Watson proudly shared family pictures and prized photos he took with former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.
 A dream come true
From Watson’s perspective, all that has happened to him over the past two-plus years has been nothing short of a miracle.  
The maintenance supervisor for a Raleigh housing provider and freelance handyman had been a renter his entire adult life. He lived a good chunk of it in Walnut Terrace, one of the city’s public housing communities.
Watson thought owning a home was improbable until 2023 when at age 62 he became able to purchase what he refers to as his “forever home.”
“I always wanted to be a homeowner but never thought I could be one because of my age,” Watson said. “The older you get, the less chance I thought I would have [to own a home].”
Watson’s once elusive dream of homeownership came true with the help of the Raleigh Area Land Trust (RALT). The nonprofit, which was founded in 2019, made Watson its first homeowner under the “community land trust model,” which is designed to ensure long-term affordability. RALT has one other land trust home in the same community and more planned throughout Wake County.
Watson purchased his 1,000 square-foot Southgate Drive home for just under $200,000. The house sits on a little more than a quarter-acre lot with a large, fenced backyard and an impressive deck that Watson added.
The mortgage payment on Watson’s dream home is around $850 a month. He was paying $900 to rent a house before moving to his new home.
“It was just a shotgun house,” Watson said. “I was still doing the maintenance. They didn’t have maintenance people to do the work, so it was really costing me more to stay there. If I’m going to be doing the maintenance, I might as well own my own.”

Kevin Campbell, executive director of RALT, said an affordable place to live for homebuyers like Watson is the reason RALT exists. “We’re trying to make an affordable homeownership opportunity with an ability to easily earn some equity along the way and at the same time, keeping property affordable permanently,” Campbell said.
Here’s how it works:

Once a home is ready, RALT sells the home at an affordable price to an eligible, qualified homebuyer household, but retains ownership of the land in trust for the community.
Ownership of the land is conveyed to the homeowner through a 99-year, inheritable and renewable ground lease.
To preserve the long-term affordability of the home, the ground lease agreement sets the resale price of the home should the owner ever decide to sell.
RALT homeowners agree to limit the amount of equity they will keep at resale so that the same opportunity and affordable price that was available to them can be made available to the next income-qualifying household.
This keeps the home affordable for generations to come and avoids rapidly increasing housing prices in neighborhoods.

Coping with a perfect storm of unaffordability 
The thing that makes community land trusts most appealing is the permanent affordability of the homes, Campbell said. That’s critical in fast-growing regions like the Research Triangle as they lose affordable housing units and populations grow, he said.
“I’ve been doing affordable housing for 35 years,” said Campbell who previously worked for Habitat for Humanity. “It’s the most stressed time I’ve seen by far. You have this perfect storm. You’ve got increased construction costs, you have higher mortgage rates for this area, you have a big population increase, so that’s putting pressure on supply.”    
According to the North Carolina Housing Coalition, nearly half of Wake County renters — 72,313 households — have difficulty affording their homes. Meanwhile 17% of homeowners — 48,177 households — have trouble affording their homes. Families that spend more than 30% of income on housing are considered “cost burdened.”
A Housing Supply Gap Analysis of North Carolina’s rental and for-sale housing supply funded by the NC Chamber Foundation projects Wake County will grow by 41,241 households by the end of the decade.
Campbell noted the Chamber’s report found a current housing gap of 53,000 units in Wake County.
“I think it’s expected to grow to 125,000 units over the next five years, so the trend is really bad and we’re trying to do what we can to address that,” Campbell said.
Chipping away at the problem
RALT is currently working on a $8.3 million, 18-unit project called The Cottages of Idlewild to serve lower income residents earning between 30% to 80% of the area median income. The project, which is located about a mile northeast of the city’s center on Lane Street and Idlewild Avenue, is a public/private partnership that received funding from the City of Raleigh. It will include four rental units and 14 for-sale units for first-time homebuyers.
Campbell said construction of the project, which will be developed based on the Community Land Trust model, will start this year and be completed in 2026.

N.C. Central University basketball coach LeVelle Moton is also a partner in the project through his company, Raleigh Raised Development. Moton grew up in the neighborhood. His grandmother lived on Lane Street and great-grandmother on Idlewild Avenue.
“A lot of people have been displaced,” Moton told NC Newsline in September. “There are a lot of people who didn’t understand gentrification. They either, Number One, sold their houses or were asked to move. So now, we’re trying to educate our community on the importance of homeownership and owning something.”
RALT received a grant from the Town of Cary and will develop four homes there, Campbell said. The nonprofit plans to purchase two homes in Apex and “hopefully” four others in Raleigh, he said.
“We’re building some momentum,” Campbell said. “I have to say that, even with the need as great as it is, the process is slow.”
RALT was incorporated in 2018. It is fairly new when compared to the Durham Community Land Trust, which was incorporated in 1987 and Community Home Trust in Orange County, which was established in 2001.
There are at least four more Community Land Trusts across the state; Asheville-Buncombe Community Land Trust, Cape Fear Community Land Trust, Inc., Watauga Community Housing Trust and West Side Community Land Trust in Charlotte.

Helping homebuyers negotiate the process
Angel Johnson, RALT’s director of homeownership and stewardship, guides homebuyers such as Watson through the process.
“I’m kind of holding their hand along this process, making sure they’re connected to whoever they’re connected with, meeting their financial obligations, making sure they’re not affecting their credit adding any debt,” Johnson said, describing her rule in the process.
Running up credit cards, not paying bills on time and co-signing loans are all common mistakes people in the process of buying homes can make to ruin their chance at homeownership, Johnson said.
In May, Watson is getting married. He laughs easily when asked if he understands he’ll be giving up his bachelor’s pad.
But life is good, and he is grateful.
“I really appreciate y’all for what you did for me,” Watson said, turning to Campbell and Johnson. “I always tell them if you ever need me for anything, I can’t say ‘no’.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSCN0103-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 06:12:16.006989

Oklahoma lawmakers have passed measures limiting foreign ownership of farmland in response to concerns about Chinese nationals and companies buying agricultural land in the state.
While approximately 4.3% of Oklahoma farmland is foreign-owned, according to the USDA’s most recent filings, most of that is held by Canadian and European companies for renewable energy projects. Less than 1% of that share is Chinese.
Still, anti-China rhetoric has largely driven legislation, and a recent poll shows Republicans nationwide are concerned about Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland. Despite that concern, this new state legislation includes exemptions for Chinese-owned food supply companies.
The carve-outs specifically exempt Smithfield Foods, the only Chinese-owned company with farmland in Oklahoma. Smithfield Foods, owned by China’s WH Group, is not affected by the restrictions and continues to raise hogs on roughly 2,575 acres in northwest Oklahoma.
Oklahoma’s restrictions mirror a broader national movement in mostly Republican states to curb foreign farmland ownership, driven by security concerns over countries the government deems “hostile.” Yet, unlike states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma lawmakers have shown little interest in forcing Chinese-owned companies already operating in the state to divest or limit their ability to expand.
In 2023, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin ordered the agri-chemical firm Syngenta, owned by the Chinese conglomerate ChemChina, to sell its 160-acre research site and fined the company $280,000. The move followed a new state law restricting foreign investments from certain countries.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted the decision during a press conference announcing the Trump Administration’s National Farm Security Action Plan, a twelve-page outline aimed at “addressing the imperative for agriculture security in America.”
“I’m so proud of the fact that Arkansas was the first state in the country to kick a Chinese-owned company off of our farmland and out of our state,” Sanders said at the press conference in July. “And we made them pay for it. Very Trump-esque.”
During the same press conference, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro brought up Smithfield Foods, noting that after its purchase by the WH Group, it “now basically controls an eighth of the world’s pork supply.” Counties where Smithfield operates in Oklahoma — Beaver, Harper, and Ellis — are even highlighted on a map included in Trump’s plan. Neither the plan nor those involved in its rollout specified any steps they might take to force Smithfield to divest.
The Smithfield exception 
Oklahoma Senate Bill 212 expanded existing restrictions on foreign ownership of farmland.
The law, which took effect in November 2023 — around the same time Arkansas ordered Syngenta to divest — could have impacted Smithfield Foods’ operations in Oklahoma. But the following year, lawmakers added an exception: landownership restrictions do not apply to foreign companies that have an agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS).
CFIUS is an interagency committee that reviews foreign investments in American companies and real estate to see if they pose national security risks. It can approve, block, or require changes to deals to protect U.S. interests.

WH Group’s 2013 acquisition of Smithfield was cleared by CFIUS, effectively shielding it from Oklahoma’s foreign ownership restrictions.
“We’re honoring the Constitution by those international corporations being vetted by the federal government,” says Oklahoma State Sen. Brent Howard, a Republican from Altus who introduced the legislation that shielded Smithfield.
Smithfield Foods has repeatedly rejected claims of “infiltration” of the U.S. pork industry by the Chinese Communist Party, emphasizing that it is managed by American executives. “We currently own approximately 85,000 acres of farmland [in the U.S.], and that number has declined considerably since the 2013 WH Group acquisition,” says Ray Atkinson, a senior director at Smithfield Foods. “The farmland we own does not present a national security risk and represents less than 1/100th of one percent of all American farmland.”
Enforcement remains selective 
During a September hearing at the Oklahoma State Capitol, a handful of lawmakers and state officials convened to discuss the perceived threat of the Chinese Communist Party in the state. Guest speakers at the hearing included Jan Jekielek, a journalist and editor for the far-right media outlet The Epoch Times, and Tom Rawlings, policy director of State Shield — both outspoken anti-China organizations.
Although the guest speakers provided no concrete examples of Chinese interference in state politics, they advocated for a state-level Foreign Agents Registration Act, which would require anyone acting on behalf of foreign governments to disclose their ties.
During his presentation, Brad Clark, general counsel with the Oklahoma attorney general’s office, turned the discussion to farmland. Clark explained how the new laws can bolster the state’s crackdown on illegal marijuana operations, some of which are run by Chinese individuals.

After Oklahoma legalized medical marijuana in 2018, the industry has drawn an influx of out-of-state growers. Alongside that growth, there have been reports of labor exploitation and illegally operated farms, including some linked to Chinese organized crime.
Clark says the attorney general’s office currently has 150 pending cases involving illegal marijuana farms. But in an interview with Investigate Midwest, he did not specify if any of those cases involve Chinese nationals or illegally owned farmland, citing the ongoing nature of the investigations.
The office says it has no closed cases related to illicit land use.
Absent from the discussion was Smithfield Foods, the only Chinese-owned company that has lobbied state officials nationwide while also owning farmland in Oklahoma.
In 2024 and 2025, Smithfield spent at least $1.58 million on lobbying and more than $90,000 in political contributions during the 2024 election cycle. The company is represented on the board of the Oklahoma Pork Council, a trade group with registered lobbyists.
During the hearing, Howard asked Clark whether SB 212 has forced any foreign companies in Oklahoma to divest.
“We received questions early on from corporations on mergers and acquisitions as they were going through those processes and came to the realization that SB 212 was taking effect soon,” Clark said, in response. “[They] needed to restructure that merger, that acquisition, so it’s highly likely that [divestment] has been involved.”
The attorney general’s office declined to answer Investigate Midwest’s questions about which corporations altered or abandoned their merger or acquisition plans, or answer specific questions about Smithfield Foods and potential divestment.
“The attorney general is against and will fight any individual or entity that exploits Oklahoma jobs to foreign nationalists or others who are not Oklahomans,” Clark says. “And that would certainly include foreign adversaries like China.”
Clark also noted that no one from the Trump administration has yet reached out to the attorney general’s office to work on the National Farm Security Action Plan, the administration’s report that highlights the counties where Smithfield Foods operates in the state.
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and other Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation have been vocal about what they see as the threat from China and the need to restrict foreign ownership of farmland. Last year, Stitt issued an executive order aimed at reducing Oklahoma’s exposure to the Chinese Communist Party.

On the federal level, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma introduced the bipartisan Security and Oversight of International Landholdings (SOIL) Act of 2025, calling for mandatory CFIUS review of foreign agricultural land purchases. Oklahoma U.S. Rep. Frank Lucas introduced the Agricultural Risk Review Act of 2025, which would make the secretary of agriculture a permanent member of CFIUS.
Stitt’s executive order, which directs the state’s retirement system to divest from foreign adversary countries like China, makes no mention of Smithfield Foods and potential divestment, and the bills introduced by Lankford and Lucas earlier this year are pending in Congress.
Stitt, Lankford, and Lucas did not respond to requests for comment.
Although Trump’s National Farm Security Action Plan emphasizes protecting the country’s farmland, it also calls for efforts to “strengthen domestic agricultural productivity.”
Smithfield Foods controls an estimated 23% of the U.S. pork market, while JBS, a Brazilian conglomerate, holds a similar share of the U.S. beef supply—a fact that was pointed out by Kansas senator Roger Marshall during the plan’s launch.

Both JBS and Smithfield went public this year, a move that could help them expand operations and further solidify their presence in the U.S. food system.
Despite introducing legislation across the country to restrict foreign ownership of farmland, lawmakers do not appear motivated to target companies like JBS or Smithfield, or to bring more of the food supply chain under domestic control.
A study from Michigan State University analyzed 143 bills aimed at restricting foreign ownership of agricultural land, introduced across 34 states, along with the actions of more than 6,700 state legislators. Despite China’s nominal makeup of total farmland in the state and across the country, the researchers found that fear and skepticism about Chinese influence in the US is what continues to drive the legislation.
“Of all the farmland that’s owned by foreigners, Chinese entities have a stake in less than 1% of that,” says Dr. David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University and one of the study’s authors. “We are targeting interests from specific countries that can lead to rises in xenophobia and discrimination.”

There were well-attended “hops” at Guard Hall and the Inter-Ocean Hotel. At midnight, as bells rang out in celebration of the nation’s Centennial, the men of the J.E. Bates Fire and Hose Company rang theirs so hard it cracked.
 

This story is part of Colorado at 150, featuring special reports on the people and history that define the state.

	But the place to be in Denver on New Year’s Eve 1875, according to William Byers’ Rocky Mountain News, was at the music hall recently opened by the city’s Maennerchor, or “men’s chorus,” a singing social club formed by members of its large German-American population.
“The Maennerchor ball was the big thing of last night, at their new hall,” reported the daily News of Jan. 1, 1876.  “Everybody and his wife or sweetheart was there. They remained long after the bells rang in the Centennial morn.”
Not quite everybody: 40 people began the New Year as inmates in the Arapahoe County jail, the News reported, and by the end of 1875 there were some 4,000 children enrolled in Denver’s public and private schools.
They were among a city population that had reportedly quadrupled in the previous five years to an estimated 20,000, and Denver’s numbers had swelled further in recent days and weeks. Members of the territorial legislature, along with delegates to its constitutional convention, were arriving from cities, towns and mining camps across the soon-to-be state. Colorado’s boosters claimed the territory’s population had reached 150,000 by 1875, though credible sources considered that an “extravagant” estimate.
“From daylight in the morning until midnight, little caucuses of from two to six gather at the hotels, restaurants, beer halls, street corners and other nooks and corners, to lay their plans for the coming events,” a correspondent from Denver wrote to the Pueblo Chieftain.

City, county and territorial offices were all closed on Jan. 1. Both the News and the Chieftain, which cited “one of the few holidays allowed newspaper men and printers,” told readers no paper would be issued on Jan. 2. The day off was an important social occasion for Denver’s burgeoning elite, and the News carried a “list of the ladies who are to receive New Year’s calls,” including the family of its publisher: “Mrs. Byers and her daughter, Mamie, assisted by Mrs. Judge Wells, the Misses Parcells and Miss Alice Hill, will receive from 12 (p.)m., at residence on Capitol Hill.”
Despite sub-zero temperatures, a revelrous atmosphere had descended on Denver as 1876 began — “the foundations of many Centennial headaches were liberally laid,” the News reported — and showed no signs of letting up for the holiday.
“It is believed that some few gentlemen, contrary to custom, will keep sober, but this announcement cannot be made authoritatively,” quipped the News.
Denver’s 50-odd saloonkeepers had recently colluded to fix the price of beer at 10 cents a glass. To make their way from one watering hole to the next, Denverites could pay a fare of a nickel to ride the City Railway, a horse-drawn streetcar with tracks that ran on Broadway, Champa and 23rd Streets.
Alongside the saloons, a city directory published in early 1876 contained listings for 22 hotels, four billiard halls, 54 grocers, three gun shops, three music shops, nine banks and nine newspapers, including William Witteborg’s German-language Colorado Journal. Two businesses that would last well into the 20th century, Joslin’s and Daniels & Fisher, were among the city’s five purveyors of dry goods. J.H. Vandeventer and T.H. Sanborn ran competing laundries downtown, while one Gustav Steup, at 114 15th Street, advertised his services as the city’s lone mustard maker.
In Pueblo — the Colorado Territory’s second city, with about 6,000 inhabitants — the main New Year’s entertainment was a day of horse racing at the fairgrounds. In the day’s final race, O.S. Sheldon’s Bay Billy beat John Davis’ Buckskin Joe to claim the $50 prize, but the real action was in the crowd, where “pool selling was lively and considerable money changed hands.”
Around the territory
Outside of Denver and Pueblo, Colorado’s next-largest population center was located in the gold-mining districts of Gilpin and Clear Creek counties, where for 15 years fortune seekers had flocked to stake claims or ply their wares in towns like Central City, Black Hawk, Idaho Springs and Georgetown. Since 1873 the region had been served by the Colorado Central Railroad, which allowed passengers to travel between Denver and its Floyd Hill terminus in two hours and 45 minutes.
Passengers could also step onto a train in Denver and step off into many of the small settlements — Boulder and Greeley to the north, Castle Rock and Colorado Springs to the south — that would grow into today’s Front Range urban corridor.
But in 1876, most of the rest of Colorado was still a long way from looking like it does today. Even in the San Luis Valley — the first part of the territory to have been settled by non-native people, Hispanos from New Mexico who arrived there in the 1840s — the town of Alamosa wouldn’t be founded for another two years. The Eastern Plains, where the Army and territorial militias had waged a bloody campaign against the Cheyenne and Arapaho that ended with 1864’s Sand Creek Massacre, were still largely deserted.

Most notably, under the terms of an 1868 treaty, nearly half of the territory west of the Continental Divide was still reserved for the Ute people, though they had recently been pressured into ceding a large portion of the mineral-rich San Juan Mountains, where a silver rush was underway. Grand Junction, Durango, Aspen, Gunnison and Glenwood Springs were among the many Colorado communities that didn’t yet exist.
The territory’s westernmost settlement in today’s Interstate 70 corridor was the tiny hamlet of Breckenridge, home to about 250 people. It had no newspaper, and bad weather and delinquent postal contractors could cause weeks-long delays in the mail arriving over snowy mountain wagon roads. Though it was a long way from Denver and its bustling nightlife, a Breckenridge resident wrote to Georgetown’s Colorado Miner to report its happy holiday mood.
“Quite a lot of jolly folks are in town this winter, and ladies enough to have a dance almost any time,” wrote the correspondent. “We have, once or twice each week, some nice music and singing at Mr. Ballou’s, and on Sunday evening church services. Our winter will pass without noticing it.”
Road to statehood
The 11th and final session of the Territorial Assembly — consisting of a 13-seat upper chamber called the Council, and a 26-seat House of Representatives — convened in Denver on Jan. 3. John Long Routt, the former Union infantry captain appointed governor the previous year by President Ulysses S. Grant, addressed the Legislature in a written message two days later.
“The progress Colorado has made during the past 15 years has excited the attention of the civilized world,” Routt wrote. “Let the efforts of all be generally directed to the furtherance of Colorado’s admission into the Union, when through the intelligence, energy and wealth of her people, she may be among the first of the states, as she has been first of the territories.”
After more than a decade of trying, territorial leaders entered 1876 confident that Colorado would soon enter the Union as the 38th state. An enabling act passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant in March 1875 had begun the process, instructing the territory to convene delegates to draft a state constitution and hold a popular vote ratifying the document by July of the following year.
As the enabling bill had made its way through Congress, and the timeline for Colorado’s long-awaited statehood came into view, an obvious nickname presented itself. Though Byers and the News would claim to have been the first to suggest it, it was in fact the rival Denver Times that first printed the words on Feb. 27, 1875.
“The delay in admission will prove no serious drawback to Colorado,” wrote the Times. “Colorado will be admitted upon the centennary of American independence, and will in the future be known as the ‘Centennial State.’”

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)For many people in eastern Pennsylvania, wintertime’s dropping temperatures signal more than just the approaching holidays. It’s also the time to break out Four Queens whiskey, oranges, honey and personalized spice blends to cook some boilo, a fragrant and alcoholic hot beverage with Eastern European roots. 
The heavily spiced and honeyed hot drink is thought to have its roots in krupnik, a liqueur from Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. But while the tradition of boilo is concentrated in the anthracite coal mining region of Pennsylvania, some have found recipes in other states, including Kentucky and West Virginia. 
Diana Prosymchak, the executive director of the Schuylkill County Historical Society, said boilo is a staple at her family celebrations, alongside kielbasa and pierogies. Her daughter now continues the family tradition.

A 2019 article from the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Laird & Company, the New Jersey business that distributes Four Queens, sold just 36,000 bottles of the whiskey annually. But 98% of those sales were in Pennsylvania, specifically in Schuylkill, Luzerne, Berks, Dauphin and Lehigh counties.

“We basically grew up on it. We never had it any other time except around the holidays,” said Prosymchak. “The house smells so wonderful when you’re cooking it.”
A sample recipe posted on Salon includes rye whiskey, whole black peppercorns, orange juice, oranges, caraway seeks, honey and grain alcohol — but most efforts are closely guarded family secrets with hundreds of variations. 
That’s one thing that makes the drink so appealing to Silas Chamberlin, who used to live in Pennsylvania’s coal country.
“The cool thing about boilo, in my opinion — and I think one of the reasons why it took me a while to make my own — is that the real recipe doesn’t exist,” said Chamberlin. 
Ann Dee has made the production of boilo a business, hosting popular classes, preserving recipes and curating spice mixes on one premise. To her, there’s no wrong way to boilo.
“There is no one way to make it. There’s no one recipe we could give you and say, ‘This is boilo,’” said Dee.
Purists will insist any spirit other than Four Queens Whiskey is unacceptable, but some versions call for vodka or moonshine. Each variation is highly individualized, down to the method used to cut the fruit.
Dee said, “There’s infinite ways to vary these recipes.”
 A taste of the holidays

Dee jokes that she was “fairy godmother-ed” into boilo, after moving to Schuylkill County at the age of 21 in 2002. Despite her curiosity, locals refused to share their recipes — until a bar patron where she worked took pity and shared the broad strokes, leaving her to figure out the details. 
The first batch turned out “awful,” Dee said, but she worked at it until, “I finally got it right.” 
Over time, she collected recipes that were starting to “die out” and preserved their unique ingredients, eventually creating a spice blend that could be purchased and used by others. Her business, Coal Country Boilo, started as a fundraiser for her community library and now shares tips for other aspiring crafters. 










There is no one way to make it. There’s no one recipe we could give you and say, ‘This is boilo.'


– Ann Dee, who hosts popular classes and has been preserving recipes. 


Prosymchak doesn’t have a specific family recipe, but does remember being prescribed the drink to cure any wintertime illness. 
“Reading the ingredients, you actually believe it is medicinal,” she said. “It was a cure-all for everything.”
Chamberlin said he made big batches to share after finding a recipe a few years ago — despite living in York County, which is outside the traditional boilo zone. 
“I’ve made it ever since,” he said. “Both to have with my family around the holidays, but also to bottle it and share with coworkers and friends.” 
For first-timers, Dee emphasized the need for patience. 
“Just let those ingredients simmer… the only thing you don’t want to let boil for too long is your citrus fruit, because it will go bitter. You want to get those rinds out of there in probably about 10-15 minutes,” said Dee. 
“There’s a lot of reasons why I feel like people should make it: it’s a lot of fun and your house smells great.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8129-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 06:12:16.006989

The country will celebrate its semiquincentennial on July 4, 2026, marking 250 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Less than a month later, Colorado, which entered the union as the Centennial State on Aug. 1, 1876, will commemorate 150 years of statehood with its sesquicentennial celebration.




Colorado Newsline is commemorating the sesquicentennial with Colorado at 150, a yearlong project reporting on the people and events that shaped our state’s history.
Click here to read the first entry in “Timeline 1876,” a special series chronicling the road to statehood and the daily lives of the territory’s residents 150 years ago.			


Colorado has been planning for the year’s festivities since 2022, when a bill passed by the Legislature established the America 250-Colorado 150 commission, a 15-member volunteer board assisted by staff at History Colorado, the state’s public historical society.
The commission has approved 12 “signature initiatives” for Colorado’s sesquicentennial year, including a documentary film series, a new historic marker program, a “digital passport” program to encourage travel and tourism around the state, and “A Portrait of Colorado at 150,” which will curate oral histories from at least 150 living Coloradans.

Another signature initiative, Colorado Heritage for All, aims to add 150 additional sites to the state Register of Historic Places by the end of 2026, with an emphasis on the historical experiences of communities of color, women and LGBTQ+ Coloradans, which previously only made up 4% of the state’s preserved buildings and sites. History Colorado says it’s already hit the halfway point in that goal, having added 75 new sites to the register as of October 2025.
At least one major sesquicentennial effort didn’t come to fruition: the Colorado 150 Pedestrian Walkway, a proposal initially backed by Gov. Jared Polis to build a pedestrian bridge across Lincoln Ave. near the state Capitol. Polis abandoned the idea after mounting public criticism and the completion of a survey in which respondents overwhelmingly opposed the $29 million project.
Events planned throughout the year
For 149 years, Coloradans have celebrated Colorado Day on Aug. 1, commemorating President Ulysses S. Grant’s statehood proclamation admitting Colorado to the union on that date in 1876.
Events currently planned for Aug. 1 include the Mile High 150 Expo at the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, and the Colorado 150 Celebration at Highlands Ranch Town Center.
A museum exhibit, “38th Star: Colorado Becomes the Centennial State,” is currently on display at the History Colorado Center in Denver and scheduled to run through Sept. 6, 2026.
The Colorado Department of Agriculture has partnered with artist Thomas Evans, also known as Detour, to create a mural at the National Western Stock Show highlighting the state’s agricultural roots. The mural’s official unveiling will take place on Jan. 10.
The U.S. Postal Service will recognize 150 years of Colorado statehood with a special forever stamp featuring a landscape by renowned Colorado nature photographer John Fielder. Officials will dedicate the stamp in a Jan. 24 event at the History Colorado Center.
Local and regional institutions across Colorado plan to hold events of their own, including the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum’s “We The People: Colorado at 150” lecture series. A local organizing committee for southwest Colorado is also planning its own program of events.
A list of events across the state can be found on the America 250-Colorado 150 website.

As of Thursday, Maine’s minimum wage is increasing to $15.10. 
Throughout last year, the state’s minimum wage was $14.65 an hour, but the Maine Department of Labor announced in September the 45 cent increase that will take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The “tip wage,” or the minimum wage for service employees, will increase to $7.55 per hour. 
This is a slightly smaller jump than the 50 cent increase the state saw between 2024 and 2025. 
Per Maine law and a 2016 citizens referendum, the state is required to make an annual adjustment based on the cost-of-living index for the Northeast Region. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, there was a 3.1% increase in the cost-of-living index between August 2024 and August 2025. 
For the first time, the state’s minimum wage will pertain to agricultural workers since Gov. Janet Mills signed a law in June that now guarantees them the right.
An estimated 35,000 workers in Maine were paid hourly and received less than $15 an hour in 2024, according to the Current Population Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The cities of Portland and Rockland have their own minimum wages, which are typically higher than the state’s. Both cities usually update their minimum wage based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, so their rate for 2025 was $15.50.
However, Portland voters approved a question on the November ballot to incrementally raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 an hour over the next three years. The rate jumps to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027, and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage will keep pace with cost of living increases.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-482149439-2048x1365-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-01 05:56:18.624847

(Photo courtesy Sugar Bowl)

NEW ORLEANS — If 76-year-old Archie Manning was listed on the College Football Playoffs injury report for the Sugar Bowl it would say: Ole Miss quarterback Manning (lower back) extremely doubtful.
“My back has just been giving me fits lately. I can hardly get around,” Manning said Tuesday from the St. Charles Avenue condo where he and wife Olivia live. “I could get on the elevator to a suite in the Superdome. It’s just getting to the elevator that’s the problem. But I’ll be watching. You better believe I’ll be watching.”
Rick Cleveland 
Fifty-six years ago, on New Year’s Day, 1970, Manning, then 20, was most definitely ready to go. Legendary Clarion Ledger sports columnist Carl Walters described it this way in the next day’s paper: “The Ole Miss Rebels became the winningest team in Sugar Bowl history this bright but cold New Year’s Day, holding off the battling, third-ranked Arkansas Razorbacks for a 27-22 victory in a thrilling contest that will be ranked with the best ever played in post-season competition.”
Manning passed for 273 yards and a touchdown, ran for another touchdown and totaled 318 yards of total offense to win the Miller-Digby Trophy as the game’s Most Valuable Player. As was the case every time Manning took the field, the numbers don’t tell the entire story. It was the competitive flair with which he played – the zigging and zagging all over the field – that stole the Sugar Bowl show.
Says Skipper Jernigan, an outstanding Ole Miss guard back then and Manning’s long-time pal, “I just remember chasing his red-headed ass all over Tulane Stadium trying to block for him. Every time I’d go to block somebody, Archie would turn and go the other direction. He was all over the place and none of the rest of us were fast enough to keep up with him.”
And this will tell you something about Ole Miss’s rich Sugar Bowl history: Manning is one of six Rebel quarterbacks to have won the Sugar Bowl’s MVP trophy. Count them, six: Raymond Brown (1958), Bobby Ray Franklin (1960), Jake Gibbs (1961), Glynn Griffing (1963), Manning (1970) and Chad Kelly (2016).

“Seemed like when I was growing up, Coach Vaught had Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl about every other year,” Manning said. “We had a great Sugar Bowl experience. I’ll never forget it. We lost three games that season, but at the end of the year we were playing as well or better than anybody in the country.”
Jernigan put it another way: “When No. 18 was clicking, we were hard to handle.”
Tulane Stadium, packed with more than 80,000 fans, was what Manning remembers most.
“God, I loved that place,” Manning said. “It still had real grass back then, and there were hedges around the field. And, man, so many people were there. I had never seen that many people in one place before. I’ll tell you this much, I enjoyed playing in Tulane Stadium that day a whole lot more than I did my first four years with the Saints.”
Arkansas and Ole Miss chewed up the field so badly the field was still a mess 10 days later when the Kansas City Chiefs trounced the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in Super Bowl IV. In fact, the NFL required the Saints to install artificial turf before the league would award the city another Super Bowl. The sad truth is that rock-hard Astroturf at Tulane Stadium and later in the Superdome might have something to do with Manning’s back issues today.
That Ole Miss made the Sugar Bowl that year was a story in itself. The Rebels suffered one-point losses early in the season to Kentucky and Alabama and was solidly defeated by Houston in the Astrodome at mid-season.
Then came November and upset victories over No. 8 LSU (26-23) and No. 3 Tennessee (38-0).
“Coach Vaught told us before the Tennessee game that if we somehow beat them, he guaranteed us he would get us in the Sugar Bowl,” Manning said. “And he did.”
But first, Ole Miss had to beat Mississippi State, no easy task at the time. “State had Tommy Pharr throwing and Sammy Milner and David Smith catching,” Manning said. “We had tied them in Oxford the year before and we had to play ‘em in Starkville that year and, man, they could really throw the football and put up some points.”
Ole Miss, with Manning leading the way, prevailed 48-22, and true to his word, Vaught lobbied the Rebels into the Sugar Bowl. There, they were to face the loser of the Dec. 6, Arkansas-Texas “Game of the Century,” a game so big even President Richard Nixon attended and declared the Dec. 6 game was for the national championship.
“We all thought Arkansas was the better team,” Manning said. “So did Coach Vaught. Arkansas had beaten Georgia in the Sugar Bowl the year before. We thought we would be playing Texas, not Arkansas”
Instead, Texas rallied from a 14-0 fourth quarter deficit to beat the Razorbacks 15-14.
“We really thought we were playing the best team in the country in Arkansas, but we knew we could play with them,” Manning said.
Fullback Bo Bowen got the Rebels off to a fantastic start, busting through a wide hole cleared by Jernigan and Worthy McClure for a 69-yard touchdown run. 
“Bo was just a great back,” Manning said. “He was really a tailback playing out of position at fullback but he really hit his stride the last half of that season.”
After that, Manning pretty much took control of the game, running and throwing the Rebels to a 24-6 first half lead. The Rebels got a lot more conservative offensively in the second half but hung on to win.
Fifty-six years later, Manning has vivid memories and not just of Tulane Stadium and the team headquarters, the old Fountainbleu Hotel, both long since gone. Among them:

Of a Sugar Bowl party the week of the game, during which a magician called up Rebel wide receiver Vernon Studdard to the stage to be part of his act. The joke was on the magician, because when Studdard returned to his seat, he had the magician’s watch.
Of how good that Arkansas team was. “They were coached by Frank Broyles, a Hall of Famer who was Coach Vaught’s good friend,” Manning said. “They had a great wide receiver Chuck Dicus, who had been the Sugar Bowl MVP the year before, and a great quarterback Bill Montgomery. Both those guys became great friends. So did Coach Broyles, who never did beat Coach Vaught. I ran into Broyles years and years later at Augusta National and he was still talking about Bo Bowen’s run.”
Of Arkansas All American middle linebacker Cliff Powell. “Man, that guy would ever more hit you,” Manning said.

Years and years later, Archie and Olivia Manning decided to watch a replay of that 1970 Sugar Bowl with ABC legends Chris Shenkel and Bud Wilkinson doing the call.
“About midway through the second half, Olivia said it looked like my good friend Jim Poole (a fantastic Rebel tight end) had his jersey on backwards,” Manning said. “Sure enough, I looked closely and the big numbers were on the front of Jim’s jersey. The little numbers, which were supposed to be on the front, were on the back.”
Turns out, Poole had suffered a first half neck injury, and Ole Miss trainer Doc Knight had taken his jersey and shoulder pads off to massage the neck at halftime. When they put Poole’s jersey back on, it was on backwards.
Turns out, Poole played that second half with fractured vertebrae in his neck. Back then, you just took a few aspirin and went back in – until they carried you off. So what will they be saying about this New Year’s Day Sugar Bowl in 56 years? That will be 2082.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/23132322/AP24101555365387.jpg,,,2026-01-01 05:56:18.624847

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)After the presents have been opened and the lights, ornaments, and tinsel have been removed, most Christmas trees seem fated for curbside pickup on trash day.  
Not so fast, state environmental officials are reminding Rhode Islanders, as even after trees stop sparkling, they can still contribute something to the world. 
The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Rhode Island chapter of Trout Unlimited will hold their annual “Trees for Trout” collection on Saturday, Jan. 10, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Arcadia Check Station. 
The check station is located in the Wood River Arcadia Management Area at 2224 Ten Rod Road in Exeter. 
Since 2018, DEM and Trout Unlimited, a national nonprofit that works to conserve rivers to nurture fish populations, have collected Christmas trees to build conifer revetments in the state’s freshwater habitats. The revetments act like retaining walls and are used to build up the eroding banks of rivers, which can make rivers too wide and shallow to serve as suitable breeding and living grounds for fish, especially wild brook trout, or Salvelinus fontinalis.  
A 2021 article by DEM noted numerous poor land use practices that lead to these suboptimal waters: “Dams create barriers and discharge warm water to the otherwise cold stream below. Cattle trample stream banks causing instability, sedimentation and high nutrient run off. Clearcutting removes trees and brush which otherwise filter water before reaching a stream. And the list goes on.”
Building up the river banks with revetments helps to mimic the natural shape and habitat of rivers. The revetments are fashioned by bundling together several dozen conifer trees with stakes and biodegradable twine. The bundled trees are then attached along riverbanks and extend into the channel, where the trees help to stem the flow of water, trapping sediment, sands, and other organic matter over time. As the dead trees build their detritus collections, they form new chunks of riverbank.  
Conifers are evergreen trees that bear cones, and this group of trees includes most of the popular Christmas tree choices like firs, pines and spruces. The trees’ densely needled, many-branched bodies provide the perfect surface to fortify riverbanks against erosion.    
“Conifer revetments help to narrow the river channel and confine the flow so that during low flows, there is deeper water, thereby creating more habitat for fish,” the DEM article noted. 
Trees eligible for use in the trout project need to follow a few rules from DEM to be donated:

Only real trees can be used. Artificial or fire-retardant trees are not allowed.
All ornaments, decorations, stands and lights need to be removed.
Whole conifer trees are needed, so trimmings or clippings can’t be donated. 
Trees over 5 feet tall are preferable.

People who want to drop off five or more trees will need to email Rhode Island Trout Unlimited in advance of the Jan. 10 event.  
Other options and guidance for Christmas tree disposal can be looked up online via the website of the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation, the quasi-public agency which runs the state’s Johnston landfill.
State environmental officials also reminded residents that they shouldn’t dump Christmas trees in waterways or on beaches, as it’s illegal without permits.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderMost legislative races are pretty anti-climatic by the time general election voters cast a ballot in the fall, and that is by design.
The state Legislature has power to determine the boundaries of its own districts, and they tend to do it in a way that protects the party in power. That leads to a lot of races where only the incumbent runs or a long-shot candidate from the other party steps up and gets a small slice of the total vote.
But when a state gets closer to 50-50, like Georgia is getting, districts that were mostly safe become less safe.
That’s what happened around the turn of the century in Georgia, when Democrats ruled the roost and Republicans were hot on their heels.
Today, Democrats – bolstered by a surprise seat flip in a northeast Georgia special election and victories in the statewide Public Service Commission race before that – think the political winds are at their back and they’ve got a shot at making big gains in the state House this year.
“There’s nothing like an election to tell us what voters think,” said Georgia Democratic Party Chair Charlie Bailey. “That’s what matters, not what I think, but what voters think.”
Bailey said Democrats are gearing up for a tough fight.
“(Republicans) are not going to sit around and spend no money,” he said. “They’re going to spend money to keep people in power that reward billionaires and big corporations. They will spend a lot of money to do that, as they have, and so it is on us to raise the resources we need and deploy them in an effective way, like we did with the PSC, like we did with House District 121, and win as many seats as we can.”
Carmen Bergman, director of the House Republican Caucus, predicted that Democrats’ effort will fall flat.
“The Georgia House Republican Caucus has a full-time political operation so that we can recruit candidates, we can train candidates, we can prepare candidates for 2026 in addition to our existing members,” she said.
Currently, the House includes 98 Republicans and 81 Democrats, including two who were recently elected and have yet to be sworn in. There is one vacancy representing a Cherokee County district that is set to be filled by a special election before the legislative session begins Jan. 12.
Bailey said there are 17 GOP-controlled House districts that are more left-leaning than the Athens-area seat that flipped in December.
“Are we going to spend significant money in all 17 of those? I don’t know. We’ll see. It depends on what the environment is like,” he said.
Bailey said there’s no guarantee that the environment will be as favorable for Democrats this year, but he’s optimistic based on the results of last year’s races.
“What it shows is that voters are quite dissatisfied and fed up with the Republican betrayal of working people, and we’re going to carry that message across all of our races across this entire state, and we’re going to net a lot of wins,” he said.
Here are some of the state House races to watch as the 2026 campaigns heat up. 
Gwinnett grudge match
Buford Republican state Rep. Sandy Donatucci won her seat in 2024 by just 80 votes out of more than 30,000, defeating incumbent Democrat Farooq Mughal. Donatucci serves on the House education, transportation, and intragovernmental coordination committees.
Mughal thinks 2026 is the year he’ll make a comeback in the Gwinnett County district. He launched a campaign over the summer with an emphasis on economic issues.
Reeves rematch
Democrats think they have a fighting chance in another Gwinnett-based district that Duluth Republican Rep. Matt Reeves now represents.
Reeves, who is vice chair of the House judiciary committee and also sits on the appropriations and insurance committees, narrowly fought off Democratic challenger Michelle Kang in 2024 by around 600 votes or just about 2% of the vote.
Kang announced her comeback bid in July with a pledge to focus on kitchen table issues.
Democrat Shelly Abraham of Suwanee, who works in the architectural and engineering industry, has also filed paperwork to run against Reeves in 2026.
Silcox in the sights
Sandy Springs Republican Rep. Deborah Silcox was first elected to District 52 in 2016 but lost in 2020 to Democratic state Rep. Shea Roberts. Two years later, after Georgia redrew its legislative boundaries, Silcox went on to win in District 53, which had been drawn to favor a Republican.
But Democrats are hoping a swing in their direction will help send Silcox packing for a second time. In 2024, Silcox defeated Democrat Susie Greenberg by 1,351 votes, or just under 4%.
Democrat Beth Fuller, a former contractor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, has announced that she is seeking election in the district.
Cleveland takes on Hilton 
As a Republican in a district Joe Biden won in 2020, Peachtree Corners Rep. Scott Hilton was seen as at risk following that year’s election, but he won convincingly in 2022 and 2024, soundly defeating Democratic opponents both times.
Democrats are hoping that with Trump now in the White House, they can push the pendulum the other way in the Gwinnett and north Fulton-based district. Former Democratic state Rep. Mary Robichaux, who lost to Hilton in 2022, was recently elected mayor of North Fulton’s city of Roswell, defeating incumbent Kurt Wilson, who had the backing of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.
Attorney Adam Cleveland, a Democrat from Johns Creek, has filed paperwork to challenge Hilton in 2026.
Potential Republican Flips
The party in the White House usually faces some heat in a midterm, and Democrats are hoping that pattern holds.
But Bergman said Georgia Democrats should not read too much into Democratic wins in other parts of the country last year.
“A special election environment is just that: It is special, strange, and odd things can happen that typically wouldn’t happen in a midterm or a general election environment,” she said.
“When you look at polling, we know Georgians think the nation is on the wrong track,” she added. “We clearly think that as a country, we are moving in the wrong direction, but that Georgia is on the right track, and that’s because of conservative Republican leadership. Frankly, the Georgia Republican brand is different than the national Republican brand, and the onus is on us to make sure that voters know that.”
One of the districts that may be most ripe for Republicans to test that theory is that of Sandersville Democratic Rep. Mack Jackson in central Georgia.
Jackson in Jeopardy?
In 2024, Jackson squeaked out a victory by 128 votes, or just .18% over Republican Tracy Wheeler. Jackson, a pastor and retired probation officer, was first elected in 2008.
Republican Thomas Wilkerson of Warrenton has filed paperwork to run against Jackson, and Sandersville Republican Trey Sheppard, a co-president of a transportation and logistics company, has also announced plans to run.
Other Democratic lawmakers who won by narrow margins in 2024 include Macon state Rep. Tangie Herring, who won by about 1% against Republican Noah Harbuck, and Butler state Rep. Patty Stinson, who beat Republican Cary Moore by about 6.5%.
As of mid-December, no opponent has filed paperwork to run in either of those districts. The official qualifying process to run in 2026 is scheduled for the first week of March.
“We are going to be playing in all of those seats and more with quality candidates who are well prepared to be able to take on that race (in 2026),” Bergman said.

David Stevenson stood in a circle of friends and colleagues in an Orlando, Florida, hotel lobby. Everyone but him wore a lapel pin that read ​“I  Fossil Fuels.”
“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”
Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.
But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in U.S. waters.
The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​“The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.
Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”
And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.
The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.
Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes” — not wind development — were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.
At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power — the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance — appeared to be on the downswing, with many U.S. facilities having recently shuttered.
We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.
I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.
The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the U.S. seems impossible.
The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.
Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.
A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.
“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved. … I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.
Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own — namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.
“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction … and tactics that delay action.”


 The path to wind opposition



Stevenson, now 75, describes himself as ​“a lifelong conservationist.”
In the driveway of his Lewes, Delaware, home sits the hybrid vehicle he often drives to a nearby beach. Solar panels glint atop the roof, which Stevenson custom-designed in 2013 to be at the ​“optimum angle” to soak up the sun. A framed newspaper article about one of his cross-country bike rides hangs on the wall of his home office, nestled alongside photos of his seven children and 19 grandchildren.
His career has intersected with clean energy — and even wind — at various points.
While working for DuPont in the 1980s, Stevenson helped the chemical giant develop the long-lasting coatings used to make first-generation solar panels and wind turbine blades. In 1999, after leaving the company, he started his own construction business and acquired certifications in energy efficiency and home weatherization. He said he eventually co-founded the Delaware Green Building Council to promote this kind of work.
But despite Stevenson’s environmentally minded career and interests, he’s built a reputation as someone dedicated to preventing, rather than enabling, renewable energy.











After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”
According to the D.C.-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.
For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.
It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.
Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm — a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware — were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”
The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.
“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”
At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration — first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.
Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.
He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.
The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”
Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.
Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”
In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone — ​“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.
He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.
Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them — as the Brown University researchers put it — was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.
His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.
There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the east coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.
Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.


 Whales and wind



In January 2023, right-wing media took an interest in whales. There had been a slew of marine mammal deaths along the east coast of the U.S. in prior weeks — and conservative media put the blame on seismic surveys for the future offshore wind developments ramping up along the New Jersey coast. Fox News host Jesse Watters interviewed a leader of Protect Our Coasts NJ, a founding coalition member that Stevenson had helped become a nonprofit.
This wasn’t the first time the media had amplified baseless speculation about wind power killing whales. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, had run a similar story in 2017. But in early 2023, the claims were getting attention from Fox, local news, and even the Associated Press.
Stevenson was in near disbelief when he heard Tucker Carlson, then a commentator on Fox News, mention offshore wind and whales in multiple segments.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.
I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”
But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted that the campaign prompted a U.S. General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)
Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms.
Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”
The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the U.S. — during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities — and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.
Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.
As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”
In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”
In this ongoing phenomena, 40% of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.
I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”


 Projects halted



Trump wasted no time coming after offshore wind when he took office in January 2025. On day one, he issued an anti-wind executive order that paused all permitting activity and derided the installations as ​“big” and ​“ugly” to an indoor stadium full of supporters.
For Stevenson and a dozen others in his influential cohort, the executive order was a good step — but it wasn’t enough to simply block new projects from advancing. In February, they petitioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue stop-work orders to the installations already being built, alleging that the projects posed a risk to whales. This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.
And it wasn’t long before the Trump administration tried to give the Stevenson-led coalition what it wanted. All five of the offshore wind projects under construction in America either have been delayed by recent stop-work orders or are reportedly under threat of receiving one.
Some in the coalition opposed such moves, recognizing that stopping projects already underway would raise energy costs. Steve Haner, a senior fellow at the Virginia-based conservative think tank Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, refused to endorse Stevenson’s petition to pause the five projects under construction — objecting especially to halting America’s largest project, a 2.5-gigawatt wind farm being built off the Virginia coast.
Under a hypothetical cancellation, according to Haner, ​“the ratepayers are on the hook” for the billions in sunk costs.

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction — but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings” — an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf” — which helped secure a reversal from Trump.
Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.
At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.
Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built in America for the next decade — save for the five already under construction.
Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term.
“They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.
It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.
Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives — ones that go beyond whales — for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the U.S. vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)
Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”
The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change — and what to do about it — evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”
“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’ … A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”
These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”
Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​“Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment.” The book came out in early fall — just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life with a decade-long delay of U.S. offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.


 Anti-wind legacy



Nowadays, Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.
“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”
All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas — which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal — was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.
Republican moderates in Washington have expressed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, utility bills, which Stevenson called his ​“primary motivation” for his anti-wind work, have skyrocketed in the Northeast and are projected to only climb higher if Trump’s policies continue to strangle the offshore wind sector.
Stevenson has increasingly drifted from the direction that other coalition members are taking. Protect Our Coast NJ — which first fanned the flames of misleading claims about whales — has embarked on a different disinformation campaign: spreading the false idea that offshore wind cables cause cancer. Embracing outlandish claims — whether it’s whale-killing ​“windmills” or cancer-causing cables — is a broader trend among Republicans who buy into conspiracy theories with their party’s rise to power.









Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32% jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.
“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy. … You don’t want 100% believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Madison–Wisconsin who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the U.S. is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.
Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seemed relieved to be doing so.
On our most recent call, in late November, Stevenson told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)
He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” Stevenson told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry — and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.
Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed offshore wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.
Stevenson also told me on the phone that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. Exxon Mobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.
I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.
I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view — that readers might see it that way.
“I don’t care if people hate me or not,” he said. ​“I’m doing what I think is right.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/newstevensonarmchair-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 05:11:57.674949

Two pitchers for the Cleveland Guardians are accused of throwing wild pitches to rig bets. And the number of Ohioans seeking help for problem gambling is way up.
Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed the law allowing sports betting, now says he regrets doing so. 
A new study by two Rice University researchers might give DeWine another reason for regret. It found that legal sports betting is associated with big increases in crime — especially assaults after home games that result in upsets.
In those cases, assaults nearly doubled — rising 93% — from the start of games to four hours after conclusion when compared to the period before sports betting was legalized. The peer-reviewed study by Hua Gong and Wenche Wang was published in the Journal of Sports Economics on Nov. 13.
“Sports gambling is exciting for fans and financially attractive for states, but our findings show it can also lead to more crime,” Gong said in a Rice University press release. “When people lose their bets or go through very stressful game moments, that emotional volatility can translate into aggressive behavior.”
The researchers used a “difference-in-differences” strategy to determine whether legalized sports betting can be linked to assaults, larceny and vehicle thefts. That means it compared periods before and after legalization using crime data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System.
The study looked at markets with NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL teams in 12 states that had legalized sports betting after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way in 2018. The last of the studied states did so in 2021. So Ohio wasn’t included because it wouldn’t legalize sports betting for another two years.
“We find a significant increase in crime between the start of a game and four hours postgame following the introduction of sports betting,” the study said. “This impact is particularly notable when the local team plays at home, and it intensifies if the outcome of the game differs from what the betting odds had predicted.”
When a game turns out differently than the odds predicted, that means losers outnumber winners, and some of those losers are bound to be upset.
Overall, the researchers saw crime increase 30% to 70% between the start of games and four hours after they ended after states had legalized sports betting. 
They also found that the effects before covid were greater than the period after stadiums reopened. But part of that could be attributable to crowd limits and social-distancing measures that were still in place.
They also found that the increased crime and violence spilled over into nearby states that hadn’t legalized sports betting.
“What surprised us most was that the increase in crime isn’t limited to states that legalize sports gambling,” said Gong, an assistant professor of sport analytics at Rice University. “Even neighboring states that do not allow betting see more crime on game days, likely because people travel to place bets and then return home.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, who plans to step down on Jan. 5, speaks at a town hall in 2025. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWriting in the “Never Trump” outlet The Bulwark, columnist Jonathan V. Last says the transformation of Georgia’s own Marjorie Taylor Greene represents “the best hope for liberalism in America.” 
That’s probably not something you ever thought you would read.
By “liberalism,” Last makes clear, “we do not mean Democratic policy preferences. I do not expect MTG to change her views on the Second Amendment, climate change, abortion, the costs/benefits of immigration, the role of America in geopolitics, or any other issue.” 
While those issues are all important, they are disagreements that we can and should resolve through the democratic process, just as we have done for more than two centuries. By “liberalism,” Last means something more fundamental. He means a renewed commitment to that democratic process of dispute resolution, and with it a rejection of authoritarian government that defies our Constitution and national legacy.
Last is hardly alone in the national media in his embrace of Greene’s transformation as a deep-winter sign of a coming political spring. Writing in a lengthy profile in The New York Times, reporter Robert Draper tells us that Greene’s disenchantment has grown so deep that she no longer watches Fox News, “because she found it factually unreliable.” Draper proposes that in her newest incarnation, Greene “may yet again prove to be a harbinger of a sea change in the movement she once helped lead.”
Then there’s George Conway, the former high-level GOP attorney, former husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, and a man now running for Congress as a Democrat. 
“(Greene) is no angel, but this isn’t an act,” Conway writes in a social media post. “It isn’t some ploy for power.” As Conway sees it, “The heavy burden of cognitive dissonance and denial” required to remain a Trump supporter “finally became unbearable for her. And she’s done with it. To the point that she’s just letting it all out, consequences be damned. She’s liberated, and there’s no better feeling.”
Me, I’m still not buying any of it.  
Call me cynical – after a decade of watching Trump, I certainly qualify – but if Trump had agreed last spring to support Greene’s Senate candidacy against Jon Ossoff, she would still be Trump’s loyal follower today. She left the cult and resigned her House seat not out of some sudden road-to-Damascus conversion, and not because of some realization about Trump’s character, but because she understood that he would not be the pathway to her ambitions. It was a decision made largely out of self-interest.
On a human level, I can accept that’s not how Greene experiences it or explains it to others. Like all of us, she wants to think the best of herself, and if that means explaining her dramatic breach with Trump in terms of finally seeing the light, or coming back into line with her Christian beliefs, I’m OK with that. Good for her. 
However, that’s not how the phenomenon is going to play out in the future. I say that because by this point, most of those who might abandon Trump based on principle or patriotism have already done so, often at considerable professional and personal loss. 
Brad Raffensperger, for example, is never going to be governor of Georgia. Liz Cheney is never going to be speaker of the House. Mike Pence is never going to be president. They sacrificed those ambitions to preserve the republic as well as their own integrity, and we should always be grateful that they did so. I disagree with them on almost every political issue, but I also admire them. They are heroes, and what they did should not be confused with what Greene is doing.
If Trump’s support continues to erode, it will be because more and more people begin to understand what Greene understands, that it’s no longer in their own personal interest to stick with him. They will abandon him because they realize that Trump cannot give them what they want or need, because in many cases he never had any intention of doing so. 
That won’t be true of some people. Certainly, those who want cruelty to immigrants, white Christian nationalism and a government that squelches dissent will continue to be made happy by Trump. Those who have achieved positions of power through abject loyalty to Trump that they could never have earned by their own merit will continue to support him because they have no alternative. In poker terms, they are pot-committed.
But for others, it may be dawning on them that Trump is not going to lead a revolution against the elite. He is not going to defend the interests of the little guy against the billionaire class any more than he is going to release the Epstein files or defend Ukraine against Vladimir Putin, because he always sees the world through the eyes of the predator not the prey.

This story was originally published by CalMatters. 
A series of immigration raids across California in 2025 had one thing in common: Most of the federal agents detaining people wore masks over their faces.
This month, the state of California and its largest county will ban law enforcement officers from covering their faces, with a few exceptions, putting local and state police at odds with masked immigration agents.
The state law gives law enforcement officers a choice: If they cover their faces, they lose the ability to assert “qualified immunity,” the doctrine that protects officers from individual liability for their actions. That means they can be sued for assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest or malicious prosecution, and the law adds a clause that says the minimum penalty for committing those offenses while wearing a mask is $10,000.
Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat who co-authored the law, said it was necessary to rein in anonymous federal agents.
“We initially were under the understanding that, oh, they’re only targeting folks who were not citizens,” Gonzalez said, “And then actually over time you learn they don’t give a [crap] who you are, they’re attacking you no matter what, with no due process.”
The Trump administration has sued to block the bill, and more than a century of federal court precedent is on its side. An 1890 Supreme Court case provides that a state cannot prosecute a federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of their duties.
The Trump administration said in its brief to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that forcing agents to reveal their identities would put the agents at risk.
During Immigration and Customs Enforcement “actions, individuals can be heard threatening to doxx and find out who officers and their family members are and where they live,” the administration’s lawyers said in the Nov. 17 brief. “There are even public websites that seek and publish personal information about ICE and other federal officers to harass and threaten them and their families.”
ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said the issue may not be as cut-and-dried as one or two Supreme Court cases. He pointed to a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the case of a federal sniper who killed a woman during the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, standoff to go to trial.
“It basically says that a federal officer can be criminally prosecuted for unreasonable actions,” Chemerinsky said. “Federal officers, by virtue of being federal officers, do not get immunity from all state civil and criminal laws.”
Brian Marvel, president of an organization that represents California police unions, said the law will make life harder for local cops and county sheriffs’ deputies. The organizations that represent police chiefs, sheriffs, agents in the attorney general’s office and California Highway Patrol officers opposed the law, too.
“I think that the state has put us in a tenuous position with this battle they’re having with the Trump administration,” said Marvel of the Peace Officers Research Association of California. “We don’t want to be in the middle of this fight. But unfortunately, [with] the desire for higher name recognition and elections in 2026, they decided to create things that are much more political and not geared toward legitimate public safety issues.”
Marvel said another drawback of the law is giving “a false sense of hope to the immigrant community in California” that the law will force federal agents to leave the state.
Los Angeles County supervisors have also approved a local mask ban on law enforcement for unincorporated areas of the county, a measure that will go into effect in mid-January, unless a court decision comes sooner.
Gonzalez noted that masks have played a significant role in recent California history. First, California temporarily made masks mandatory in public and at work during the pandemic. Then, a couple of years later, a rush of smash-and-grab robberies were harder to solve because the suspects all wore masks.

The law provides exemptions for N-95 or medical-grade masks to prevent infection transmission, and permits undercover operatives to wear a mask.

There’s plenty coming in the next 12 months that we couldn’t possibly anticipate. But there are a few things we know, for sure, we’ll have answers to by the end of this year. 
Here are the things we don’t know now that we will know soon:
Who will be the next governor of Connecticut?

Connecticut’s election calendar brings certainty as to when voters will endorse, nominate and elect a governor in 2026. Nominating conventions are in May, primaries are Aug. 11 and Election Day is Nov. 3. The actual outcome?
Well, the gamblers who publicly forecast elections are liking the early chances of a threepeat for Gov. Ned Lamont. One, RacetotheWH.com, gives Lamont a 95.9% percent chance of retaining what pretty much everyone considers a safe Democratic seat and projects him winning by 18.6 percentage points.
Rep. Josh Elliot, D-Hamden, has shown little progress in his campaign to convince Democrats to deny a sitting governor the nomination to another term.
On the Republican side, former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart and state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich are doing their best to ignore each other and the prospect of a late entry by Betsy McCaughey, who was New York’s lieutenant governor in the last century and is teasing making her Connecticut electoral debut at age 77.

Will the economy enter recession?

The first half of last year came with worries about the economy — with post-pandemic fears about inflation, stagnant wages and affordability further complicated by uncertainty over changes to trade policy and waves of new tariffs. Many of those concerns remain, as a “K-shaped economy” — one where high-earners experience relative prosperity while lower-earners struggle — becomes a popular way for understanding the muddled national economic outlook.  
The ups and downs have stoked fears that the U.S. is entering a recession, defined as a period of widespread economic decline that usually lasts at least a few months. For some economists, several states — including Connecticut — could already be in one.
If the nation does reach the economic standard for a recession this year, Connecticut may be more prepared that some: The state has $4.3 billion in its rainy day fund and recent stress tests have shown the state has enough to survive a hypothetical downturn for several months. But the story of 2026 won’t just be the technicalities of the economy, but how people are experiencing it. And with state unemployment up slightly from the start of last year, the state’s labor force declining, and consumer costs on the rise, one thing to watch for is what further economic strain could mean for the everyday lives of Connecticut residents.

Will Connecticut keep its WNBA team?

After more than 20 years as Connecticut’s lone major league professional sports team, the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun face the possibility of moving out of state. News that the Mohegan Tribe, the team’s owners since 2003, were exploring a sale first popped up last spring. By August, a reported $325 million deal between the tribe and Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca emerged that would move the team to Boston in 2027, placing it in a larger New England market that could provide improved facilities.
The months since were confusing. The WNBA said the Boston deal wasn’t valid, arguing that any team sales must be handled through the league before they can be approved. There were other proposals for the Sun as well, including a deal that would keep the team in state but move games to Hartford, as well as a controversial state-backed proposal that would see Connecticut purchase a minority stake in the team using pension funds. 
So far, the league has effectively killed these proposals by ignoring them, discouraging the state from submitting any official offer. The Sun is definitely sticking around in Uncasville for the 2026 season, but with a new WNBA team potentially joining the regional market in Boston in 2033 or later, and the WNBA reportedly eyeing a sale to Houston, the Sun’s time in Connecticut could be setting.

Will there be a ‘blue wave’ in midterm elections?

Democrats are looking to build on their “blue wave” that swept local elections across Connecticut and a handful of states at the end of 2025. During this year’s midterm elections, they will test whether they can continue that trend. Republicans could defy the odds in a cycle that’s considered tough for the incumbent party.
This November, the U.S. House and U.S. Senate will be up for grabs — Republicans control both chambers with narrow margins. The party that controls the White House historically loses seats in a midterm year, and these elections tend to serve as a referendum on the current administration. Democrats’ last wave election was in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, when they took back the House and gained a net total of 41 seats.

Will Connecticut lawmakers consider a public option for health insurance?

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

This one’s probably not going to happen in 2026. On the campaign trail, Lamont has introduced the idea of “a Connecticut option” — some type of health plan that will offer residents access to high-quality health care at an affordable price. But the details are vague, and the governor himself has admitted the policy is still in very early stages. He’s said he thinks it will likely take a year to sort out the details and he expects to propose legislation related to a Connecticut option in 2027.

How many new units of housing will Connecticut towns add?

Credit: Stephen Busemeyer / CT Mirror

House Bill 8002 goes into effect this year. The sweeping bill addresses zoning and eliminates some off-street parking minimums, among other measures. We’ll start to see towns prepare for implementing some of the requirements and instituting others. 
Under the law, towns with populations of at least 15,000 must create fair rent commissions or join regional commissions by 2028. This means that 32 more towns have to create fair rent commissions.
We can also expect to see towns working on their housing growth plans, which are official plans to increase the number of designated affordable units in a town. The plans, required under the law and due every five years, must have specific goals, with the number of units towns think they’ll zone for.
Municipalities can decide whether to participate in a regional plan or develop their own. The first plans aren’t due until 2028, but towns will soon have decisions to make about how they want to move forward.

What effects will the Trump cuts have on Connecticut’s state budget?

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

Though President Trump and the GOP-led Congress likely will extract hundreds of millions of dollars from Connecticut’s budget starting in 2027, state policymakers will face many questions — and some financial hits — this year.
Should Connecticut replace some or all the roughly $350 million in federal premium assistance that about 140,000 enrollees in health insurance plans sold through the state exchange likely will lose to start the year?
What happens to an estimated 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness expected to have lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by March 31 because of new work requirements or other rules changes? If Connecticut were to cover the monthly cost for this group, which involves one tenth of the state’s total SNAP caseload, legislators have said it likely would be less than $10 million.
And some federal tax changes — aimed primarily at the wealthy but also assisting corporations, will be in effect in the coming year. That means Connecticut — which links its state corporate tax system to the federal code — expects to lose about $70 million in revenues by June 30.

(Getty Images)I have had the same exact New Year’s Eve resolution for as long as I can remember: “Do better.”
It might seem easy and overly simplistic, but if you have spent any extended period of time attempting self-improvement, you know how difficult change can be to bring about. The marking of a new season can help measure change. I believe that is why we are celebrating a new year, or maybe it’s because we made it through another span of difficulty. 
Resolutions rarely stick. I watch the gym at the beginning of each year, packed to the brim, and 90 days later we are back to open treadmills.
Angela Duckworth wrote in “Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance” that “enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare.” I agree. We might start excited, but eventually our fortitude will be tested, and the fun time becomes a hard time. This is when the actual progress begins. 
I used to read John Knowles’ “A Separate Peace” every year during my 20s for fun. It was my yearly ritual. I would pick it up at the beginning of the year, right after New Year’s Day. The story never changed, but what I felt would, sometimes. “A Separate Peace” is a story of a friendship between Gene and Phineas. A tale of innocence lost, youthful rebellion, jealousy, and the encroaching tension of World War II. 
In one particular scene, there’s a visit to a tree at Devon Military School. It’s the summer of ’42, which Gene, the protagonist, refers to as his “sarcastic summer.” Gene and Finny were students at Devon, and at this moment, they were having fun as boys climbing a tree without a worry in the world, able to ignore the knowledge that they were being prepared for war. (The tree is a significant character in the story)
At one point, Gene says: “So the more things remain the same, the more they change after all — plus c’est la même chose, plus ça change. Nothing endures, not a tree, not love, not even a death by violence.”
I wrote this quote on the cover of my first diary when I arrived in Kansas. I understood that change is inevitable at a young age, growing up a military brat, following my father from one post to the next.
I was younger than my son, now 14, when I first read “A Separate Peace.” My son used to love climbing trees when he was younger. He would call out to me to watch how high he could get. I, too, loved to climb trees as a child. I think about those bright, soft moments of childish glee often when I look at the cottonwood out my window, changing with the season. Trees carry so much time within their bodies.
This New Year’s day, I will probably reread “A Separate Peace” again. I want to experience and try to understand those boys from a father’s perspective. When I look out my window at another tree stripped by the cold season, I wonder if I am the old giant, now shrunken by age in my son’s eyes, that Gene describes. 
I think about my child, and the tension of war that is encroaching on our peace, again. And I’m hoping we choose to “do better”, for our sons’ and daughters’ sakes. We already know how this story will unfold if we don’t.

(File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)As housing prices and monthly rents soar, advocates, lawmakers and the Moore administration say they share a goal of protecting Maryland families in an unstable housing market, even as the state faces its own financial woes.
But that means balancing protections for renters and families while courting developers to build new housing units, at a time of shrinking federal funding. It’s a tough task, says Matt Hill, attorney at the Public Justice Center, which is part of the Renters United Maryland coalition, but he says renter protections and affordable housing efforts are “needed now more than ever.”
“People are living on a knife’s edge because of the lack of affordable housing, because of the lack of stability in the economy and in their own lives,” Hill said.
Matt Losak, executive director of the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, said federal cuts to safety nets like food assistance and Medicaid will also affect people’s ability to afford housing. People waiting for emergency housing assistance “are literally hanging on for dear life,” he said.
“When they cut social benefits, like rental assistance program money or the federal impacts of cutting HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) money, [they] are going to add to the pain and disaster being felt by people on the low end of the spectrum, and the vast majority of them are renters,” Losak said.
For veterans of the housing fight, most of the issues will be familiar, while some are likely to have a bigger stage — like proposed wrongful detainer legislation, to cut down on people wrongfully living on someone else’s property, better known as “squatting.”
Housing officials, advocates warn shift in HUD funding could unhouse thousands in Maryland

Hill says some of the legislation proposed last year to expedite evictions in certain situations could have chipped away at due process for the person living in the space.
“We’re calling it the ‘Evict First, Ask Questions Later’ bills, because that’s really what the proposals are,” Hill said. “It’s going to allow for either the sheriff or the court to evict someone before they even had a chance to get a fair hearing.”
One bill that became law this year was Senate Bill 46, sponsored by Sen. Ron Watson (D- Prince George’s), which requires a hearing within 10 business days of a wrongful detainer complaint being filed. It took effect in October. Other wrongful detainer bills filed during the 2025 session.
Renters United Maryland said it anticipate other legislation that could threaten due process in eviction cases to reemerge in 2026, and worry that wrongful detainer bills could be used “as a tool for personal revenge.”
“Survivors of domestic abuse and their children are particularly at risk, as well as differently abled people. No matter the context of the allegation, Black women, who are already disproportionately affected by eviction, will suffer most under an evict-first approach,” the group said in a statement.
Emergency rental assistance
Advocates say they will push for a boost in funding for emergency rental assistance programs, particularly for a newly launched effort to keep lower-income families with kids housed during financial struggles.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) recently announced the opening of applications for the Community Schools Rental Assistance Program. It would let families of children in community schools, which have a relatively high number of low-income families, to get some extra money to help pay for housing when faced with eviction or utility cutoff because they are behind on their payments.
It’s a start, but not enough, advocates say: The program is limited to families in Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Frederick, Montgomery, Prince George’s, Washington and Wicomico counties, and they say it is “critically underfunded.” The 2024 bill creating the program allowed the governor to allocate up to $10 million, but it was funded at half that this year.
How many is 96,000? Key housing number cited by Moore is hard to explain

“Kids can’t learn if they slept in a homeless shelter the night before, or have to constantly transfer schools,” said Renters United Maryland in its list of legislative priorities. “Maryland should fully fund this program to help roughly 9,375 residents avoid eviction.”
‘Lessons learned’
Moore and Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day, meanwhile, said they will try again to streamline the housing development approval process to facilitate new development. The goal is to build new units across the state and reduce Maryland’s near 100,000 housing unit shortage, which state officials say contributes to the high housing costs in Maryland.
Administration officials say there were “lessons learned” during a rocky 2o25 session, when a relatively late start contributed to much of their housing package being scuttled.
Day began pitching Moore’s 2025 housing legislation to county officials in December 2024. That package, which aimed to tie housing development to areas with high job growth, immediately came under fire from county lobbyists who said it encroached on local decision making. It did not get a hearing until March, when it was heavily rewritten to grant vesting rights to developers, and ultimately died in a Senate committee as the session ended in April.
This year, Day has been working since August to get county officials on board with a bill to create “vesting rights” for developers, allowing them to keep the rights to develop a property once they have won approval for the project.
Some housing and renter advocates worry that the push for new housing comes at the expense of tenant protections, including the nearly 10-year effort to allow “good cause” evictions in the state.
“Our main concern is that that narrative not be used as a substitute for renter protections,” Losak said. “We are somewhat concerned of this idea that we can build our way into affordable ownership so that people don’t have to rent housing anymore.”
Renter advocates in recent years have been pushing bills that would let local jurisdictions decide whether to implement a “good cause” eviction policy, which requires a landlord to cite a specific reason why a tenant is getting evicted. The policy would be an option for counties under the bill, not a requirement.
Housing lobbyists say that regulations like good cause evictions or rent stabilization policies discourage developers from building in those areas.
Renter advocates gather in Annapolis to call on lawmakers to pass Good Cause Eviction legislation. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
A good cause bill passed the House in 2024, but died in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.
In 2025, the committee amended the bill to require that local jurisdictions choose either rent-control measures or good cause evictions. It was seen as an attempt to satisfy tenant advocates and developers, but Losak and others saw the amendment as a “poison pill” and momentum for the bill died.
Losak hopes the bill can come to a vote “in an acceptable form” this upcoming session.
“They may bring it to a vote, but if it includes poison amendments, like a requirement that local jurisdictions weaken rent stabilization programs, then it will be unacceptable,” Losak said. “That just becomes a vehicle to torpedo stable housing programs for renters.”
One big difference from recent years, Losak noted, is that 2026 is an election year, which could help the bill get over the finish line after almost a decade.
“We’re heading into an election year. The public … are more attuned to good cause now than they’ve ever been,” he said. “I think elected officials are aware that the public is concerned and that might have more influence this year … I think they’ll have to make a calculus as to whether it’s worth it if they play games.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Housing-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 04:57:09.619294

There is Gov. Gavin Newsom’s all-but-announced campaign for president, centered on his self-appointed role of resistor-in-chief to Trump. As Newsom continues to troll Trump this year we may learn whether it continues to advance Newsom as a White House frontrunner or becomes tiresome and off-putting.
As 2025 ended Axios, a news website, reported that Newsom’s potential rivals are ratcheting up efforts to undermine his bid, arguing that, as a California progressive, he’s unelectable.
Another point of political fixation is Newsom’s successful effort to gerrymander California’s 52 congressional seats to help Democrats recapture control of the House in 2026. Whether it works is a question hanging over his presidential ambitions.
Still another is the campaign to choose a successor to Newsom. It so far has attracted a large contingent of Democrats without, as yet, a clear leader. There’s a theoretical possibility that with as many as a dozen Democrats in the field, the two Republicans could finish first and second in the June 2 primary and face each other for the governorship in November, despite the GOP’s very weak standing among voters.
This year’s election cycle also promises to be another showdown of moneyed interests via dueling ballot measures, with those either increasing or decreasing taxes at the top of the heap.
While political junkies can feed their habits this year, the more profound issue that faces California will be its moribund economy.
Newsom often brags that California’s $4 trillion economy, were it a nation, would rank fourth in the world. However, it has seen zero net job growth since the COVID-19 pandemic ended and recently has experienced employment shrinkage.
More than a million Californians in the labor force are jobless and the state’s unemployment rate, currently 5.6%, has been the highest or near the highest of any state for several years.
Employment doldrums have affected even the state’s hallmark sectors, most obviously Southern California’s withering film and TV production industry and the Bay Area’s high technology concentration.
The latter has almost single-handedly propped up the state’s economy and generated a huge portion of tax revenues, but layoffs have proliferated as artificial intelligence is increasingly employed — a syndrome that also affects Hollywood.

Stubborn, or even increasing, unemployment makes it more difficult for state and local governments to cover their budget deficits — thus underpinning the thrust for tax increases on state and local ballots. The sluggish economy also hampers efforts to improve two of the state’s most pressing socioeconomic issues, its highest-in-the-nation poverty and homelessness levels.
Even Californians who have homes and jobs are feeling the economic pinch. Combining economic data with polling results, the Public Policy Institute of California recently discovered rising economic angst among California residents.
“California is one of the largest economies in the world, but many working Californians do not feel economically secure (and) they struggle to pay their bills, save for the future, and balance the demands of work and daily life,” PPIC reported, adding that polling data “indicate that pessimism about future economic opportunity has become even more pervasive amid recent economic volatility.”
As he shifts into presidential campaign mode, Newsom has every reason to keep bragging about the state’s economy. But those running to replace him and state legislators should make 2026 the year to recognize that California has serious problems, to bore into the underlying causes and to do what they can to once again make California thrive.

(Photo by krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)There’s a new kind of “property insurance” being sold in Florida starting today, Jan 1.
And it’s for your pets.
The Florida Legislature passed HB 655 unanimously last spring and it was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis on April 22.  The bill amends the definition of property insurance to explicitly include insurance coverage for accidents and illnesses or diseases in pets and establishes a regulatory framework for pet insurance policies sold in Florida.
The bill also regulates the marketing and sale of pet wellness programs to prevent them from being misrepresented as insurance. If sold alongside pet insurance, wellness programs must be optional, clearly separated, and independently priced.
Florida is the 14th state to put such regulations into place, Insurance Newsnet reported.
A 2025 North American Pet health Insurance Association report shows that 7.03 million pets were insured in North America at the end of 2024. Total premium volume in the U.S. reached $4.7 billion at year end 2024. Florida is a lucrative market, the analysis shows, with the  more than 6% of the gross written premium nationwide coming from the state.
Specifically, HB 655 amends the Florida Insurance Code to include definitions for pet insurance and wellness programs. The former is defined as coverage for accidents, illnesses, and diseases of pets and reimburses a policyholder for expenses associated with medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment provided by a  veterinarian.
Pet wellness, meanwhile, is defined as a subscription- or reimbursement-based program separate from an insurance policy and that provides goods and services to promote the general health, safety, or well-being of the covered pet.

Laws can take effect immediately upon being signed, on July 1 with the start of the state’s fiscal year, on Oct. 1, or even on Jan. 1, which generally is the start date for insurance related bills because that’s often when insurance policies take effect.
Many of the laws that take effect today change the state’s criminal or civil statutes
HB 655 is one of two insurance-related bills that take effect Jan.1. The other, SB 158, prohibits the state group health insurance program from imposing any cost-sharing requirements with respect to coverage for diagnostic breast examinations and supplemental breast examinations.
A legislative staff analysis notes that while the state group health insurance plan provides diagnostic breast examinations without cost sharing requirements, “cost sharing for supplemental examinations among the current plans vary. ”
The bill provides parameters for what constitutes supplemental breast examinations, prohibiting cost sharing for examinations that are medically necessary and appropriate breast imaging examinations; used when no abnormality is seen or suspected; and based on personal or family medical history or other increased risk factors.
The Division of State Group Insurance within the Department of Management Services said the ban on cost sharing requirements could increase claims costs in the state group health insurance program by $3.6 million annually.
Bill sponsor and nine-year breast cancer survivor Sen.Lori Berman, D-Boynton Beach, said eliminating the cost sharing requirements will  help save lives.
“The reason why we’re doing it is because people often can’t afford the next step. When you do need the supplemental testing, an MRI …  or an ultrasound can cost as much as $1,000, so people delay,” she said. “And  we know that when breast cancer diagnoses are delayed it leads to worse outcomes.”
The new law only applies to the state group health insurance plan.

State lawmakers closed a more than $3 billion budget gap with program cuts and tax increases, only to be presented with another $1 billion-plus budget hole in 2026 — when taxes are likely off the table because it’s an election year. Turnover in Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) Cabinet picked up and 2026 races started to take shape, with lots of blanks still to be filled in.
Immigration enforcement accelerated and a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador became the face of opposition to the Trump administration’s policies. Thousands of federal workers in Maryland lost their jobs and tens of thousands sat at home through the longest government shutdown in history.
The year also saw one young man realize his goal of making chromite the official state mineral, and another young man successfully push for markers — a butterfly symbol — on drivers licenses to alert police to hidden conditions, like autism. The states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreed on a new framework for improving the bay, and even though advocates wanted more, it was something.

Campus and city officials do what they can, but say that it's limited.","Luxury student apartment buildings line Route 1 near the University of Maryland, including Tempo, right, and University View, left. Over the past decade, high-end developments have reshaped the corridor, driving up rents for students living near campus. (Photo by Mehedi Marof)The living room wasn’t meant to be a bedroom, but it’s the only space Ibrahim Mohammed can afford. His mattress sits against one wall beside a folding table that doubles as his study desk. There are no doors for privacy, and the kitchen light spills into the space where he sleeps.
It is not what he pictured when he left India for graduate school.
Mohammed, 25, pays $460 a month for that corner of a Graduate Hills apartment adjacent to the University of Maryland. The whole two-bedroom unit costs a little over $1,700 after an 18% discount the complex offers graduate students. His rent is low only because he sleeps in the hall. “It’s a huge degradation from how I lived back home,” said the data science master’s student at the university.
“Rent takes everything,” he said, with most of his $18-an-hour campus wages gone as soon as they come in. “I work in the catering section at Stamp [Student Union] between classes,” he said, a workload that “does hamper education.” He covers his tuition with a loan he took in India.
Mohammed’s experience reflects the pressures facing many of university’s graduate students. Riley Lankes, a Ph.D. student and an organizer with the Graduate Labor Union, said many graduate students are priced out of the College Park rental market and forced to live farther from campus, increasing commute times and transportation costs, while cutting into time for teaching, research and coursework.
The union has called on the university to raise graduate stipends, create guaranteed on-campus housing for grad students and cap rents in university-affiliated housing at a level tied to stipends. Union leaders say their rent should not exceed one-third of a graduate assistant’s income.
The university has taken steps to address graduate pay, even as it acknowledges that housing costs remain “a challenge in the Washington region,” said Dennis Passarella-George, campus director of Resident Life. The university sets a minimum graduate assistant stipend each year “to meet or exceed the university’s cost of attendance as calculated by the Office of Student Financial Aid,” with individual schools encouraged “to offer higher, discipline-specific pay,” he said.
Trump administration to garnish wages for defaulted student loans

The university increased minimum graduate assistant stipends by 64% between fall 2019 and fall 2025, Passarella-George said, including a 1% cost-of-living adjustment this academic year, amid what he described as “significant budget challenges.”
Still, students say housing costs continue to outpace those increases. Roughly 10,592 graduate students, including 4,232 grad assistants, are enrolled at Maryland, university data show, and Lankes said many of those assistants’ stipends “fall short in College Park’s rental market.” He pays around $2,000 a month for a one-bedroom apartment near campus, he said, while taking home roughly $2,100 after taxes for his 20-hour-per-week assistantship in the College of Information.
Federal housing guidelines recommend spending no more than 30 percent of a household’s income on rent, a benchmark that the Graduate Labor Union has adopted in its call for affordable housing. A first-year graduate student on a full assistantship earns a minimum of $35,074 for a 12-month appointment, requiring about 20 hours of work a week, graduate school data for fiscal 2025 show. Thirty percent of that  $2,917 monthly income would mean about $877 a month is available for rent.
It is rare to find stable housing in College Park — aside from improvised arrangements like Mohammed’s — that a graduate student can afford, Lankes said. “If my partner didn’t help me with half of the rent, I couldn’t cover my expenses,” he said.
One-bedroom apartments in College Park average $1,600 to $1,900, according to RentCafe, Apartments.com and Zillow. Two-bedroom units run $2,000 to $2,400, these sites show, and students often end up paying $1,000 to $1,400 per person for a single room in a shared apartment.
Those with part-time hourly campus jobs, like Mohammed, bring home even less each month than the graduate assistants. And for international students, federal rules restrict employment to only on-campus jobs for no more than 20 hours a week.
The university enrolled between 3,400 and 3,800 international graduate students over the past two years, according to International Student Services data.
Over the past decade, a wave of luxury-style student housing has risen along Route 1 — 16 complexes in total, according to College Park Mayor Fazlul Kabir and Nick DiSpirito, the campus student liaison to the city council.
City Councilmember Denise Mitchell said recent development patterns have pushed many students farther from Route 1 and the main campus. “The current housing stock is driving up the prices,” she said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She said the strain now extends beyond the university to become a regionwide affordability issue. Rising rents across the region, she said, have pushed some students “from American, Georgetown, Howard and Bowie State [universities] into College Park.”
Passarella-George said the city offers a “wide range of housing options,” including apartments and rental homes, and said many graduate students prefer “independent, apartment-style living.” University-owned residence halls prioritize undergraduates in their first two years, he said, while graduate students have been directed to university-affiliated but privately owned housing operated by Southern Management Cos. at Graduate Hills and Graduate Gardens.
Those two complexes, located next to campus, offer a total of about 475 units. Published floor-plan pricing lists rents at about $1,422 for a studio, $1,650 for a one-bedroom and $1,970 for a two-bedroom — before an 18% discount available to university graduate students through the university’s partnership with the operator.
The university’s partnership with Southern Management helps students avoid “application fees and credit-check requirements often imposed by off-campus landlords,”  Passarella-George said.
Additionally, the university provides “a number of resources” to support international graduate students in their housing search, he added. Students can also seek guidance from the International Student and Scholar Services office and Graduate Legal Aid.
Students should weigh “distance, amenities, and the type of living environment they prefer,” adding that “at times, cost may need to outweigh the convenience of being located immediately adjacent to the university,” Passarella-George said.
When somewhat ‘affordable’ housing comes with inconvenience
For Ph.D. student Rahayu Adzhar, the affordability gap became clear even before she arrived on campus. Lab members told her Graduate Hills and Graduate Gardens were the only relatively cheaper options for graduate students, she said.
She put her name on the waitlist. It never moved.
Instead, she bypassed the system by taking over someone else’s lease: a $1,040 studio apartment at Graduate Hills. The price was considered “modest” because of the discount, she said, but it ate up nearly half of her monthly after-tax income of about $2,100.
Issues began immediately, Adzhar said: The heating and cooling were “often dysfunctional,” the basement unit smelled damp, and plumbing problems routinely made the shower barely usable.










Most of the developments are not in the affordable category based on the standard definition of affordability .... Property owners can set the rent as they wish. We cannot directly control rent. These are private entities. We don’t own them.


– College Park Mayor Fazlul Kabir, on the challenge affordable student housing


Maintenance staff fixed individual issues, like a broken shower nozzle, but later, she said, when another issue erupted, she decided to move out.
Finding affordable alternatives was no easier for her.
Adzhar now rents a $1,000 basement in a single-family home in Hyattsville. It is cleaner and quieter, she said, but several miles from campus. And transportation is becoming harder to manage.
Campus transportation services cut back the Hyattsville shuttle runs, from about five daily a year ago, according to archived schedules, to three times a day now. Adzhar said she often has to pay for rideshares to get to class.
Adzhar, who is also a member of the Graduate Labor Union, said the university should “provide more student housing,” including guaranteed on-campus options for at least “30 to 50% of the graduate student population,” and rents in university-affiliated housing of no more than a third of the lowest graduate stipend.
“If we are struggling every month to pay rent and buy our groceries, we cannot focus on research or education,” she said.
A system not built for affordability
College Park officials say the affordability crisis has been a decade in the making.
Mitchell said that historically, the city hadn’t differentiated between student housing need and general affordable housing need. “As long as I’ve been on the council, we never thought about student housing needs,” she said.
For years, she said, the city relied on the city–university partnership to discuss availability of student housing along Route 1, particularly for “undergraduate students who have to leave dorms after sophomore year.” But beyond that, she said, “there really hasn’t been definitive stakeholder work on student affordability.”
Kabir, the mayor, agreed new construction along Route 1 has skewed upscale. “Most of the developments are not in the affordable category based on the standard definition of affordability,” he said.
Maryland universities saw international student enrollment decline over past year

Part of the reason rents remain high, Kabir said, is that landlords have broad latitude. “Property owners can set the rent as they wish,” he said. “We cannot directly control rent. These are private entities. We don’t own them.”
He said the lack of affordability is  “not acceptable.”
Mitchell said the city lacks a key tool that might otherwise help.
“The city doesn’t have land-use authority,” she said. “We can’t control zoning. The county holds that power, and they’ve resisted letting municipalities have it.” Because of that, she said, College Park has little ability to influence what kinds of housing get built or to push developers toward affordability.
Kabir said the city is doing what it can by updating its Revitalization Tax Credit Program, which encourages developers to set aside affordable units in exchange for reduced city taxes. “We are sacrificing some tax revenue so these units can be affordable,” he said, noting the specifics are “negotiated case by case.”
Unfortunately, city student liaison DiSpirito said, “Landlords also use the timing of the market to their advantage.” Many complexes, he said, push students to renew leases for the following year almost as soon as they move in, while most single-family rentals don’t hit the market until late spring.
DiSpirito and fellow liaison Amira Abujuma have pressed for an ordinance that would bar landlords from requiring renewals more than 180 days before a lease ends. “It’s about restoring freedom of choice,” DiSpirito  said. The council delayed a vote on the proposal until February.
Students with nowhere else to turn can turn to the Thrive Center for Essential Needs, which supports those facing housing, food or financial emergencies, said the center’s case manager, Chamika Ellis. The center’s assistance includes emergency break housing, emergency grants, meal swipes, financial-aid interventions and connections to Prince George’s County youth homelessness programs when on-campus housing is not available, she said.
Ellis said the center routinely works with international, LGBTQ+, and Black and Latino students, as well as graduate students whose incomes “do not stretch far enough.”
“We’re trying to fill gaps,” she said. “But the need is bigger than what we can cover.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-30-at-5.33.49 PM-1024x675.jpeg,,,2025-12-31 21:57:07.606169

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)In a lengthy decision Wednesday, the Montana Supreme Court rejected a recommendation Attorney General Austin Knudsen should be suspended from practice for 90 days in a professional misconduct case.
The order cleared Knudsen of three professional misconduct allegations, but it found he violated two other codes of conduct.
However, the order said Knudsen’s due process rights had been violated in the case in multiple instances, as he had alleged, and the justices declined to take additional action.
“Due to the (Commission on Practice’s) violation of Knudsen’s due process guarantees, we dismiss this case without further action,” the order said.
A Supreme Court summary of the case said a six-member majority of the seven-member panel agreed with the decision to dismiss the case without suspension.
In a statement on the Department of Justice website, Knudsen thanked the Supreme Court.

“I appreciate the Supreme Court bringing this frivolous complaint to a long-overdue conclusion,” Knudsen said in the statement. “We’ve said it from the very beginning, this was nothing more than a political stunt.
“I’m glad this distraction is behind us as we continue our work at the Department of Justice to keep Montana the best place to live and raise a family.”

Most Supreme Court justices had recused themselves in the case, and the chief appointed district court judges to serve on the panel instead.
Heard in the Montana Supreme Court in March, the case stems from a dispute among the three different branches of government during the 2021 legislative session and allegations Knudsen improperly disparaged the court and defied court orders.
In the September 2023 complaint, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline against members of the state bar, alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct in 41 separate counts — allegations one of his lawyers described as a “political stunt.”
In October 2024, the Commission on Practice, which regulates the profession, found Knudsen violated five rules of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, and it recommended the state Supreme Court suspend him for 90 days.
In an appeal, Knudsen not only objected to the recommendations, he alleged due process violations.
In March before the state Supreme Court, Knudsen’s lawyer argued the court should dismiss the case as a “highly irregular and unprecedented one.”
The Office of Disciplinary Counsel argued Knudsen deserved to be suspended to protect the integrity of the court, which his actions would otherwise undermine.
Five members of the state high court recused themselves in the case, and Chief Justice Cory Swanson appointed five district court judges to serve, in addition to himself and Justice Katherine Bidegaray.
The judges were unanimous in their decisions on four of the five alleged violations of professional misconduct, and six members came together in the fifth allegation, according to the case summary.
“There’s an old saying in our profession that ‘bad facts make bad law,'” the order said. “This case presents an unusual accumulation of bad facts.”
The order said the case was important to address the specific allegations against Knudsen but also provide guidance for the future conduct of attorneys and disciplinary proceedings.
In addressing allegations of rule violations, the order said Knudsen breached the conduct code when he failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s order to return materials obtained by a subpoena and also directed or approved of a subordinate doing the same.
But the order also said the Office of Disciplinary Counsel failed to show Knudsen, a Republican in his second term in office, made statements that were knowingly false when he criticized the court as alleged.
“Each of his statements critical of the court was either a factual statement, which ODC failed to prove was false, or a statement of opinion,” the order said.
It also said the Office of Disciplinary Counsel failed to prove his conduct improperly influenced a court proceeding.
The order rejected the recommendation for a 90-day suspension, and a summary said the opinion should be considered a public admonition.
The decision drew immediate praise from Republican leaders in Montana including U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy and state Senate President Matt Regier of Kalispell.
“We must draw a bright line for the public between true ethical violations in government and manufactured controversies like the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and Commission on Practice’s shameful political persecution of Austin Knudsen,” Regier said in a statement provided by the Senate Republican communications director.
In a statement provided by The Political Company, Sheehy also lauded the decision.
“It’s good to see this politically-motivated complaint finally come to a just conclusion. I look forward to continuing to work alongside Attorney General Knudsen and the rest of the Montana delegation to secure a safer and more prosperous future for all Montanans,” Sheehy said in the statement.

 1.GOP fights and fractures 

Montana has grown increasingly more red in recent years, but this year showed Montanans a power struggle within the state GOP.
That battle took place within the 2025 Legislature and outside of it.

During the session, Republicans in the Senate elected more conservative leadership, but their power was quickly undercut when nine more moderate members of the party joined with Democrats to make deciding votes on critical legislation.
In the legal arena, a political fight in Ravalli County led to a court order that found Republican party leaders had disenfranchised voters.
The Republican plaintiff in the case said members of the Freedom Caucus are having undue influence on the state GOP.
In June, Montana Republicans elected hardliner Art Wittich as state party chair after the retirement of longtime chairperson Don “K” Kaltschmidt in a move that will shape elections in 2026.
 2. Property tax relief … or not

The Montana Legislature made property taxes a main character of the 2025 Legislative session, and discussion on the topic dominated the final weeks of lawmaking.
Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte pushed for a homestead tax exemption, with the idea that those with second homes would pay more of a share. With rises in home values, and thereby, property valuations, a worry in western Montana is that Legislative changes won’t end up having much of an impact.
The bill lawmakers finally approved at the last minute did give some reductions, including for residential owners, though frustration continues.
Additionally, there’s been long-running concern people who may be eligible for property tax relief aren’t being told they are and end up not getting the benefit.
Lawmakers eventually shifted the property tax burden around and didn’t reduce overall tax collection by the state.
  3. No Kings rallies all over Montana 

Residents in Montanan’s smallest and largest communities rallied multiple times throughout the year in solidarity with a national No Kings Protest movement standing against the Trump administration. Thousands gathered in cities like Bozeman, Billings and Missoula, with more than two-dozen different protests taking place during a June event.

At rallies coordinated in early October, the hamlet of Polebridge, outside Glacier National Park, saw its population exceeded by the more than 60 protesters, many in costumes, that gathered to sing and listen to elected officials talk about the importance of raising their voices.
In Dillon, about 200 people lined North Montana Street, waving signs and playing guitars. They were worried about energy costs, immigration raids and the protection of their public lands.
Crowds lined the streets in Hamilton as well, rallying for democracy, the U.S. Constitution, civil liberties, immigrants, health care, the proper use of military troops, and for science and research.
  4. Medicaid spared in Montana 

The Montana Legislature approved Medicaid expansion with bipartisan support, and Gianforte signed it into law.
The bill legislators approved, sponsored by Rep. Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls, essentially continues the program as reauthorized in 2019.
Eligible adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty limit qualify, and nearly 80,000 Montanans participated in Montana at the time the bill was passed.
During the session, some legislators argued an appetite to cut spending at the federal level would affect Medicaid in Montana.
This summer, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law with significant changes for federally-funded health care programs.
  5. Federal government shutdown hurts Montana’s tourism

When the government shut down this fall, a big front-facing indication of the gridlock came at national parks. Visitors could still enter them, but without employees to staff entrances, clean toilets, and provide communication and emergency services, revenue was lost and visitor experiences were limited.
Glacier saw roughly 70,000 fewer visitors in September and October compared to last year, dropping from being on pace for the 2nd highest visitation on record to being down 2.4% over last year’s number, though the park will still see the third highest visitation ever.
Yellowstone, meanwhile, is currently on pace for its second-highest year ever, but also saw a drop-off during the shutdown, with roughly 40,000 fewer visitors passing through the park than in 2024. However, more than one million visitors entered Yellowstone in September and October, straining staff and resources.
  6. New voting law causes more Montanans to have rejected ballots 

A new law sponsored by Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell passed the Legislature this year requiring a voter to write their birth year on their ballot next to their signature for verification purposes. The law, which was challenged in court, went into effect for the first time during November’s municipal elections across the state.
The results were mixed, with some counties, such as Lewis and Clark County, seeing little to no impact on rejected ballots, due mainly to a robust public awareness campaign and a trial run during a primary. But most of the other populous counties in Montana saw rejection rates up to 10 times the average, with thousands of ballots missing signatures. Some counties saw from 1% to 5% of ballots rejected, requiring county staff as well as hundreds of voters to take time to resolve the errors.
  7. Water crisis at prison 

Montana State Prison faced a prolonged water shortage in early October, leading the governor to call up the National Guard and creating frustration for the families of prisoners.

Tents were set up outside for prisoners to shower in, water bottles were passed out, and portable bathrooms were put up outside.
Officials attributed the water crisis to deferred maintenance, and they moved planned construction at the prison to the top of the state’s priority list.
The Legislature had previously budgeted $21 million for the project. Water quality has been a long-running issue at the facility, which is situated in a Superfund site.
Water was restored at the facility in late October and the state says the water at the prison is safe to consume.
  8. Montana wants to hunt more wolves as feds move to delist 

Just a few weeks into the 2025 Legislature, a marathon committee hearing saw a reinvigoration of a long-time debate in Montana: are there enough, or too many wolves in the state.

In 2021, the Legislature pushed through a law directing the state Fish, Wildlife and Parks commission to reduce wolf populations to a “sustainable level.” But wolves have stabilized around 1,140 wolves, give or take, for the last 10 years. While lawmakers in 2025 voted down bills that would have allowed unlimited, or near unlimited, wolf hunting seasons, the FWP commission did boost the state’s hunting and trapping quota by about 37%, to 458 animals, spawning multiple lawsuits.
Similar conversations are taking place at the national level, as lawmakers in Congress push to remove the species from the Endangered Species List and turn over full-time management to the states. In December, the U.S. House voted in favor of a bill co-sponsored by Montana Rep. Troy Downing to remove federal protections from gray wolves and prevent courts from reviewing the law.
  9. PSC tussles while NorthWestern contemplates merger

The Montana Public Service Commission stayed busy this year, taking on significant cases, reversing course in one, and managing internal conflict.
The PSC approved the controversial Yellowstone County Generating Station at $246 million, less than NorthWestern Energy wanted for the methane-fired electricity plant but more than some parties argued it should get. Customers will pay for the plant.
The monopoly utility also announced a proposed merger with Black Hills Corp in a deal the PSC will scrutinize in the coming year.
Late this year, commissioners quickly reversed course in a decision to call for a federal investigation of NorthWestern Energy’s formation of a shell company to take on new shares at Colstrip from Puget Sound Energy.
The case is still pending with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The PSC is made up of five elected commissioners, currently all Republican, and this year, the politicians squabbled, ousting PSC President Brad Molnar from leadership after less than one year and following the launch of an internal investigation that remains pending.
 10. Controversial bathroom bill among the first laws passed

Gianforte signed House Bill 121 in late March, which would require public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females, and require people use the one “designated for their sex” based on “external genitalia present at birth.”
The legislation almost immediately ended up in court, where it remains.
Plaintiffs in that case argue it’s a crystal-clear case of discrimination. Conservatives supporting the legislation have argued it’s about protecting women and girls.

Five state senators, all Democrats, referred in their letter to correspondence with Evnen in October when they reminded him of an “obligation to protect Nebraska voter privacy from unwarranted federal overreach.”
They said Evnen had indicated in a response at the time that he would not comply with the federal government’s request to turn over detailed voter information due to pending litigation. 
Voting advocacy group Common Cause Nebraska has sued to block the sharing of that voter data with the U.S. Department of Justice.
But Wednesday’s letter was penned in light of a more recent news story published in the Nebraska Examiner Dec. 18, which led lawmakers to believe Evnen, a Republican, had been communicating with the DOJ regarding release of the data. 
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha was joined in the request by Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha,  Danielle Conrad and Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Victor Rountree of Bellevue.
Trump’s DOJ offers states confidential deal to remove voters flagged by feds

The group sought to know more about the “timing and results of negotiations” between Evnen’s office and the feds. 
It said in part: “If you are not forthcoming to this request, we will explore other remedies to fully understand what you are doing in Nebraskans names and with public resources which may risk their sensitive personal and voting information or contradict your prior position.”
Evnen could not immediately be reached for comment on the Wednesday letter. The news story that lawmakers referred to in their letter quoted a spokesperson for Evnen saying he plans to comply with the DOJ request, pending the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit.
Evnen has noted that he sought guidance from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, and was “fine” with handing over the information because Nebraska’s voter rolls are “complete and proper.” 
The Stateline story, published in the Examiner, revealed details of a confidential draft agreement the DOJ sent to more than a dozen states, including Nebraska, that would require election officials to remove any alleged ineligible voters identified during a federal review of their voter rolls.

The agreement would hand the federal government a major role in election administration, a responsibility that belongs to the states under the U.S. Constitution. While the DOJ has demanded states’ voter rolls since summer, Stateline said the draft agreement offered the most detailed picture yet of how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
Federal officials have said they need voters’ detailed information to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote. Critics have pushed back over concerns such as privacy, identity theft, national security and political targeting. 
Juarez said Wednesday the lawmakers’ letter to Evnen was prompted by concern over private discussions the secretary of state may be having regarding release of Nebraskans’ personal voting data.
“Really what is going on in those conversations?” she said. “It’s concerning.”

Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn denounces the Trump administration's freeze of child care funding to Minnesota at a press conference Wednesday Dec. 31, 2025. (Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Child care center owners and Minnesota Democratic leaders decried on Wednesday the Trump administration’s freeze on federal funding to the state, which they said would cripple an already fragile industry.
“Fraud is never acceptable. But cutting off child care funding to everyone in the state is not the answer, and it’s not acceptable,” said Amanda Schillinger, a child care center director, who said that her center will shut down if it loses the 75% of children it cares for whose families receive government help for child care.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday in an X post that it has frozen all child care payments to Minnesota in response to new fraud allegations from a viral YouTube video that has gotten over 2 million views. The video by right-wing social media influencer Nick Shirley showed Somali-run child care centers that receive state and federal funding but had no children, fueling the Trump administration’s latest attack on Minnesota, which is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S.
One provider, Naima Awes, said in an interview Wednesday that over 90% of the 52 kids at her Minneapolis day care receive Child Care Assistance Program funding, without which her business will shut down. Awes said that state inspectors visit her site every 6 months.
Awes, who is Somali, said that a group of teenagers came to her day care center on Monday in search of fraud, scaring employees and kids.
The Trump administration is also taking aim at other states. In the same X post announcing the funding freeze, Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said that the department will also start requiring states to provide “justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.”
The department could not offer many specifics on the new review process when asked about it Wednesday.
Decade-long history of fraud investigations
Minnesota receives about $185 million annually from the federal Child Care Assistance Program, which helps low-income families with child care so parents can work.
Over 20,000 Minnesota children will lose access to child care without that federal funding, Schillinger said Wednesday at a press conference at the state Capitol. Kids Count On Us, a child care advocacy group affiliated with the multifaith religious organization ISAIAH, hosted the press conference.
Fraud in Minnesota’s state- and federal-supported child care program is not new, with media reports and federal charges going back a decade. But new allegations come amidst a newly intense focus on Minnesota public programs arising out of federal prosecutions of public program fraud under both Democratic and Republican administrations, as well recent right-wing media accounts that have grabbed the attention of President Donald Trump and his administration.
The state’s child care system is already confronting a crisis of both affordability — Minnesota child care is among the most expensive in the nation — and a shortage of labor.
A statement from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison called into question the legality of the funding freeze: “This hasty, scorched earth-attack is not just wrong, it may well be illegal.”
A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office declined to elaborate on the possibility of a lawsuit from the state.
State investigates centers from video
State inspectors went out Monday to check that children were present at the day cares in the viral video, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families said in a Monday news conference. The commissioner also said that all the day cares in the video had been visited by a state inspector in the last six months. The same day, federal Homeland Security agents came to Minnesota to do their own inspections.
A representative from the Department of Children, Youth, and Families did not respond when asked to comment on the result of the Monday inspections.
Rep. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, DFL-Eden Prairie, said at the Wednesday conference that the investigation is ongoing.
Kotyza-Witthuhn said that the state has not been requiring photo evidence as part of its review process, adding that new federal requirements are “something that we can take under guidance when we return to the legislative session.”
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican who is challenging Gov. Tim Walz in next year’s election, said this week that her caucus steered Shirley to child care sites in Minnesota, Minnesota Public Radio reported.
The slashing of child care funding is just the latest crisis to engulf Walz’s administration — and his reelection campaign.
The widespread defrauding of safety net programs on Walz’s watch was already emerging as a key issue as he seeks an unprecedented third, four-year term in 2026. But that was before a report in the right-wing City Journal claimed money pilfered from Minnesota safety net programs was winding up in the hands of Somali terror group al-Shabbab, even though federal prosecutors have never brought terror financing charges in their vast investigation, and both chief prosecutor Joseph Thompson and former U.S. Attorney Andy Luger have downplayed the possibility.
Regardless, Trump then amped up racist language against Somali Americans — most of whom are American citizens — calling them “garbage.”
Trump’s supporters have joined in, putting Minnesota the center of a right-wing maelstrom, with new federal investigations announced regularly since then.
A spokeswoman for Walz said he “has worked for years to crack down on fraud and asked the state Legislature for more authority to take aggressive action.”

A Gallatin County District Court judge ruled that the Montana Department of Environmental Quality didn’t take a “hard look” at the water quality impacts of a proposed subdivision a quarter mile from the Gallatin River.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper filed a lawsuit against DEQ in 2023, arguing a project at an old quarry to build eight high-density housing buildings could harm an already impaired river.
The lawsuit focused on the development’s septic system permits and the state approval process for the build.
“DEQ has consistently failed to evaluate what’s happening in a river as a whole with many sources of nutrient pollution and seems to find individual new sources insignificant,” Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “But it never goes and looks at the system as a whole.
“And so when the agency doesn’t look at the system as a whole, you can’t render an evidence-based decision on whether or not something is going to cause harm. And that’s the penultimate question that not only the Water Quality Act, but the Montana Constitution requires.”
The project was approved in 2022, the same year the Environmental Protection Agency declared the Gallatin River to be “impaired,” due to an increased number of algae blooms and other contributing factors.
The blooms harm fish and plant life and are a growing problem and concern for environmental groups, anglers and those enjoying other outdoor water recreation activities. The Gallatin River has seen an increasing number of algae blooms, which the state has investigated.
The court ruling said DEQ’s failure to assess cumulative impacts of the project, and approval of the permit despite not knowing the cause of algal blooms, was “arbitrary, capricious and unlawful and in violation of the Montana Constitution, (Montana Environmental Policy Act) and the (Water Quality Act).”
DEQ generally does not comment on litigation, a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email on Wednesday afternoon.
In the decision issued on Dec. 29, the court did rule in favor of DEQ on two claims. It said the agency did not violate administrative procedures or otherwise constitute unlawful rulemaking. 
Additionally, the court said the DEQ did not violate the Montana Water Quality Act’s nondegradation policy, meant to protect the state’s natural resources. In this case, the court did not reach a conclusion about whether there had been violation of the policy because any potential pollution hasn’t happened yet.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper called the decision a major win. Other litigation pending, from Citizens for a Better Flathead, in the Flathead Valley, the Lakeside Sewer and Water case, still has a claim out regarding the “hard look” mentioned in the Quarry subdivision, which found that scrutiny is required in all cases.
“This decision reinforces that Montana law requires transparency, sound science, and accountability before approving new sources of pollution,” a press release from the organization stated. “If Phase 1 of the Quarry Project is to move forward, DEQ must redo its review and meaningfully analyze cumulative nutrient impacts on the Gallatin.”

“Sustained and consistent mixed-use or compact housing development will bring the TIF district into balance over the long run and result in higher overall annual revenues,” wrote Ilona Blanchard, the city's community development director.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Dec. 24, 2025.
The South Burlington Tax Increment Financing district is in good financial standing, but according to a recent report, for the city to realize the full benefits of its success, development and growth must continue.
The city will hold a “substantial change” hearing next month to update anticipated growing costs in the TIF district and financing plan, particularly for outstanding projects, with costs that have exceeded former projections.
TIF is one of the most powerful economic tools available to municipalities for financing public and private development. It is essentially a way a town or city pays for improvements in a specific area without raising taxes.
Once the area is designated — in South Burlington’s case, it’s a small subset of the 300-acre City Center — the current level of property taxes from that area continues to go to schools and government as usual. The municipality is then able to borrow money to build roads, sidewalks or other public infrastructure. As development happens, property values rise and generate extra tax revenue. That extra tax money is used to pay back the borrowed money.
The idea is that, as the infrastructure is built and improved, it attracts private sector investment in new and renovated buildings and increases the value of the grand list.
South Burlington’s TIF district was instituted in 2012, but the city didn’t incur its first debt until 2017, setting the 20-year increment retention period in motion. Since then, the city has made several advances in its own projects and in incentivizing the private sector to build up City Center. Over 650 new homes have been built in the area, along with approximately 80,000 square feet of first-floor commercial space. Ninety-six homes are currently under construction in the district.
And this year, the TIF district expenditures and revenues are in balance. As part of the city’s overall 2025 grand list, the TIF district grand list was $107.8 million higher than that area was in 2012 — almost three times the 2012 original taxable value. The city expects to add $1.77 million to the fund by the end of the current fiscal year, more than $600,000 than the prior year.
South Burlington’s community development director and unofficial TIF district guru, Ilona Blanchard, told the city council last month that, while the TIF district is performing well, projection models show lower revenues and a deeper need to cushion the TIF district fund if no future development occurs.
“Sustained and consistent mixed-use or compact housing development will bring the TIF district into balance over the long run and result in higher overall annual revenues,” Blanchard wrote in a memo. “Ongoing efforts to encourage additional development are promising, including recent actions to update zoning regulations, but permits have yet to be filed.”
Blanchard’s “break even forecast” estimates that 56 rental apartment homes need to be added each year to result in a positive balance at the end of the TIF district’s life — fiscal year 2038 — with no surplus revenue.
Growing project costs
The city has four remaining TIF district projects to complete, with four — including Market Street and the city’s municipal buildings —already complete.
But the costs for those projects are increasing. Most notable is a proposed bike and pedestrian bridge over Interstate 89, where the estimated cost has increased by nearly $13 million since 2021. The project is 30% eligible for TIF.
The city has received two major federal grants for the project, totaling $17.7 million, in addition to the roughly $70,000 in federal funds expended during the scoping period of the project.
The project was initially put out to bid in May, but when bids came back, both came in significantly higher than previously anticipated.
As this project is shovel-ready, the city is “value engineering” the project to rebid for construction, perhaps this winter, while also working to obtain an estimated $3.5 million of gap funding.
“We’re squeezing down that initial cost as much as we can, and we’ll be looking for more grant money,” Blanchard said, noting the project will likely be broken into phases. “We’re keeping the overall designs but there are a few things that will change.”
Other outstanding projects include the second and third phases of Garden Street, the City Center Park Phase 2 recreation path — connecting Market and Garden streets to the City Center Park — and the Williston Road Streetscape, which improves bicycle and pedestrian access on one of the city’s busiest corridors.

When Gov. Phil Scott announced that state workers would need to return to offices at least three days per week starting Dec. 1, the state employees’ union warned the initiative could cause a mass exodus of top staff.
So far, that doesn’t appear to be the case. 
Comparing mid-September to mid-December of 2025 to the same period in 2024, retirements are up slightly from 66 to 76, according to data from the Vermont Department of Human Resources. Resignations, on the other hand, have fallen from 205 to 185, a drop of nearly 10% compared to last year.

Sarah Clark, Vermont’s secretary of administration, said in an interview earlier this month that the number of applicants for state jobs has actually risen. 
“When you look out at what’s happening both in the federal government and the private sector, I think state government is a very attractive employer,” Clark said, crediting in part the state’s health and pension benefits.
The Vermont state government and its employees’ union have been facing off since Gov. Phil Scott announced this summer that employees would need to return to work in-person at least three days a week. Like many employers around the country, Vermont’s government is navigating the challenge of trying to bring its workforce back into the office more regularly following the normalization of remote work during the Covid-19 pandemic.
As for how the first month of the three-day office mandate is going, Clark described it as relatively smooth, though navigating childcare and long commutes are top issues state employees have reported. 
“This is a big change for our workforce, and I’m empathetic to their concerns and needs,” she said. “But (I’m) also excited about the opportunity that it presents for us supporting Vermonters and also working collectively together.”
Despite the administration’s optimism, the Vermont State Employees’ Association — the union representing state workers — is continuing to pursue legal challenges to the mandate.
The administration “didn’t talk to employees. They just threw this out there, and said, ‘This is the way it is,’” Steve Howard, the union’s executive director, said. “We don’t agree with that. We think they have an obligation to bargain with us.”
In late November, the state employees’ union took the Scott administration to court, hoping a judge would deny or delay the return to office mandate. The judge ultimately did not issue an injunction, finding that state employees had sufficient relief available to them through the state’s exemption process, through which employees can make their case for working remotely more than two days per week. But the union has continued its legal challenges, with a Vermont Labor Relation Board hearing expected in February, according to Howard. 
Howard said employees have received “contradictory guidance” from managers about when to apply for exemptions and what might qualify a person for an exemption, and some supervisors “still don’t know what to tell people” about how to navigate the mandate.
As of mid-December, the Scott administration had received about 500 requests for exceptions to the in-office policy. About 40 had been approved, according to Clark, and the rest remained outstanding, with employees allowed to work their previous schedules while their requests are processed.  
State leaders have said they are reviewing all employee requests for more remote work flexibility on a case-by-base basis. It’s unclear if the approved requests have any similarities. While state-issued guidance has listed very limited circumstances when exemptions may be warranted, officials have said exceptions are not limited to those reasons. Any employee who believes they have a “compelling reason” for an exception can make their case, according to state guidance. 
Vermont’s flexible working arrangements law also allows employees to request changes to their working arrangements, such as remote work flexibility. Employers must consider an employee’s request and whether it “could be granted in a manner that is not inconsistent with its business operations or its legal or contractual obligations.”
Half to two-thirds of state employees had already been working in person more than three days per week and thus their work was not impacted by the hybrid mandate, Clark said.
In a tight budget year, the added cost of returning to offices has drawn criticism. The state is leasing new office space in Waterbury to accommodate workers, paying $430,000 in the first year and $2.3 million by the end of a five year lease. 
The new offices also require one-time costs to prepare the sites to be occupied by state workers, which total $385,000, according to Clark. 
While data doesn’t show a mass exodus of state employees, some have reported resigning as a result of the return to office. 
Matthew Grimo, a paralegal with the Vermont Agency of Transportation, said he had been commuting two days per week from Burlington to Barre. An extra day of the roughly 50-minute commute wasn’t a financial burden he could accept. Grimo submitted his resignation last week. 
“I love my team, I love working with my team,” he said, “One hundred percent I wouldn’t have considered this if the return to office had not cropped up.”
Grimo said he submitted a request to be exempted from the three-day requirement in November and had continued commuting two days per week since — the number of days he’d been told to commute when he was hired in 2024. But he had yet to hear back from the state, Grimo said, and felt he had to assume his exemption wouldn’t be approved and decided to resign accordingly. 
“The state, the administration was incredibly unclear, and to this day, is still incredibly unclear with exactly what they expect and what they will allow with employees,” he said.
In his new job, Grimo will actually need to commute more often, but the drive will be much shorter.
“It’s five minutes from my house versus an hour,” he said, “which makes all the difference to me.”

The devastation left by Typhoon Halong in Western Alaska was historic — and life-changing for many — this year. The storms prompted a massive disaster response and public safety effort, including the largest mass evacuation in state history. 
Gov. Dunleavy joined other Republican governors and approved the Trump administration’s request to deploy Alaska National Guard service members domestically for “civil disturbance operations” in Washington D.C. , and 100 service members are set to deploy in March. 
The Dunleavy administration also agreed to detain 42 men arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from out of state in June, amid a nationwide immigration crackdown. The move, and subsequent transfer of detainees back to Washington state, raised questions and concerns from lawmakers and advocates around why they were transferred to Alaska and conditions in Alaska prisons. 
This year, University of Alaska researchers told lawmakers that policy to mitigate crime should focus on violent crime because according to the most recently available crime data for 2023, violent crime rates remained “exceptionally” high, even though Alaska’s property crime was declining. 
Here are some of the top stories of the year: 

The remnants of Typhoon Halong caused massive storm surge and hurricane force winds that devastated coastal communities, particularly in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, and prompted the largest mass evacuation from Western Alaska in state history.

The catastrophic storm left one person dead and two more missing. Dozens of homes floated off their foundations, communities across the region sustained damage, and existential questions arose around the region’s future because of intensifying climate change factors that amplify environmental risks.
The Alaska Beacon was on the ground in Bethel at the time the storm hit, and documented the first evacuation flights as hundreds of residents from Kipnuk and Kwigilingok boarded Alaska National Guard flights from the National Guard Armory in Bethel to Anchorage. 
Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which oversees the Alaska National Guard said this was the largest off-the-road-system response for the National Guard in his 45-year career in the state.
Officials with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management put the process of repairs and debris clean up on pause for winter. The state’s disaster response effort  will pick up in the spring in coordination with federal agencies, regional tribal organizations, non-profits and local partners.. Both state and federal disaster assistance program application periods have been extended to February 2026, to allow more time for residents to apply for relief. 
The total cost of the storm damage is still unknown, and the Western Alaska region faces a long road to recovery. 

Gov. Dunleavy approved a request from the Trump administration to deploy 100 Alaska National Guard service members to Washington D.C in March of 2026.

Days prior to the announcement, lawmakers raised concerns about the Pentagon directive to the Alaska National Guard to prepare a quick response force for “civil disturbance operations” in American cities. 
Service members are directed to train for crowd control and to quell civil unrest. Officials with the Dunleavy administration said the Alaska National Guard is preparing such a force to align with national level requirements. 

Researchers with the University of Alaska Anchorage told lawmakers that policy to address crime should focus on violent crime, as the most recent data available shows that even though Alaska property crime was declining, violent crime rates remained “exceptionally” high.

According to 2023 data, the most recent year available, Alaska’s violent crime rate was 5.4 times the national rate, at 1,975.2 per 100,000 residents, dominated by aggravated assaults. That includes reported crimes, and actual prevalence of crime incidence is likely much higher, researchers said. 
“Alaska’s crime problem is really a violent crime problem,” Brad Myrstol, a professor with the UAA Justice Center at the University and director of the Alaska Justice Information Center told lawmakers in February. “If you want to understand crime in Alaska, you might want to look at violent crime first.”

The Dunleavy administration approved the transfer of 42 men arrested in other states by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement into Alaska’s correctional facilities. The men were detained at the Anchorage Correctional Complex for several weeks in June. 

Officials said the transfer was part of an ongoing agreement between the Alaska Department of Corrections and the U.S. Department of Justice, intended to alleviate overcrowding in the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. The Alaska House Judiciary Committee held a fact-finding hearing where lawmakers and advocates raised concerns about the state’s agreement with federal law enforcement — and conditions within the Anchorage jail after reports of a pepper spray incident, use of criminal lockdown, and lack of access to medical care, attorneys, and translation services.

Advocates with the ACLU of Alaska reported that Alaska saw a significant increase in immigration arrests in Alaska this year. The organization tracked at least 70 arrests, a nearly 500% increase over last year. 

Officials grappled with the rising number of deaths in Alaska jails and prisons. The Alaska Department of Corrections reported a record-tying 18 deaths in custody this year. 

There have been at least 84 deaths in custody since 2020, which some lawmakers and advocates say is preventable. They are calling for the reinstatement of an independent oversight body to investigate deaths and provide recommendations for prevention. 
State corrections and medical officials testified to the Legislature in the spring that a higher number of deaths are attributed to natural causes within an aging prison population. Several incidents of alleged medical neglect and suicide in recent years prompted families to file wrongful death lawsuits against the department.

The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, generally prevents the military from participating in civilian law enforcement.“We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!” Trump wrote on his social media site, TruthSocial.The president first deployed National Guard troops earlier this summer to Los Angeles, following massive protests against immigration raids. He has continued to send service members to cities with Democratic leaders, a decision that has tested the legal bounds of presidential authority on military law all the way up to the Supreme Court.An appeals court in early December ruled that the Trump administration must remove troops from Los Angeles, which upheld a lower court ruling that found it illegal to keep an extended military presence long after protests quelled. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.The judge, Karin Immergut, found the move to use service members for the purpose of protecting a federal immigration facility exceeded presidential authority.

The agreement […]","Photo illustration by Getty Images.Lee Enterprises, which owns five news outlets in Montana, announced that billionaire David Hoffmann of Florida is leading a $50 million purchase agreement that will give him a controlling stake in the company.
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, Lee Enterprises said in a news release Tuesday.
The agreement puts Hoffmann in line for chairperson of the board in place of longtime chairperson Mary Junck, who said the move will “create long-term value” for the company.
In Montana, Lee Enterprises owns the Billings Gazette, the Missoulian, the Helena Independent-Record, the Montana Standard, and the Ravalli Republic.
The company has been cutting newsrooms in the state for years. In spring 2023, Lee Enterprises eliminated at least 13 newsrooms positions in Montana representing one third to one half of existing editorial staff at its papers.
In 2024 in the span of three months, Lee newspapers in Montana lost 70 years worth of journalism experience when the company cut a managing editor and two veteran journalists chose to leave.
The news release from Lee Enterprises did not address whether the agreement came with a plan for investment in newsrooms, and in an email, a spokesperson for Lee said the company did not have further comment.
In a statement, Hoffmann said the deal strengthen’s the company’s balance sheet.
“With improved financial stability and a clear governance framework in place, the focus can now be on disciplined execution and long-term value creation,” Hoffmann said.
The deal was announced after Lee Enterprises canceled a special shareholder meeting set for Dec. 19 one day before it was scheduled.
The company was slated to review financing proposals in the face of financial challenges.
In November, Lee Enterprises reported a $36 million net loss for the 2025 fiscal year. It said a cyber attack earlier this year cost $4 million in restoration alone.
The new agreement is expected to save the company millions of dollars in interest payments.
It lowers the rate on $455.5 million of long-term debt from 9% to 5% for five years, “materially improving” the company’s “cash flow outlook,” according to Lee Enterprises.
The news release from Lee Enterprises said its board of directors unanimously approved the deal and “decisive action was required.”
A news story from a Lee reporter said the company found itself “without other options.”
The Quad City Business Journal described Hoffmann as “a renowed entrepreneur and philanthropist.” It said Hoffmann, as founder of Hoffmann Family of Companies, oversees a network of enterprises that employs more than 17,000 people around the world and includes properties in 30 countries.
In December 2024, Hoffmann declared an interest in becoming Lee’s largest shareholder. Hoffmann Media Group is a subsidiary of the Hoffmann Family of Companies.
“We believe in newspapers, local journalism, and digital media,” Hoffmann said in a statement at the time. “We have been and continue to be successful throughout the country with our media assets.
“I’m not going away, and we will continue to invest. We feel local journalism is a part of the fabric of America and will invest to protect it and help it prosper.”
The president of Lee Montana could not be reached Wednesday for comment; Dave Worstell is the outgoing president, retiring this year, and his out-of-office message directed emails to incoming head of Lee Montana Bill Merrill, who could not be reached by email on Wednesday morning.
According to the news release from Lee, CEO and President Kevin Mowbray is retiring as part of the deal. Chief Operating Officer Nathan Bekke is expected to serve as interim CEO, and a search is underway for a permanent CEO, according to the news release.

(Photo by Johner Images/Getty)The DeSantis administration said Wednesday it no longer will require some children to go uninsured for two months before enrolling them in the federal children’s health insurance program, or CHIP.
The Agency for Health Care Administration announced in the Florida Administrative Register that it was amending its CHIP State Plan to eliminate the 60-day waiting period for enrollment in Kidcare for children who previously were insured through an employer-sponsored or private health benefit plan.
The CHIP state plan represents Florida’s official agreement with the federal government laying out how the program will operate. The requirement that those children go uninsured for two months has been established in Florida law since the program was created in 1998 to prevent “crowd out.”
According to the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy Center for Children and Families, crowd out occurs when public funds substitute private dollars that otherwise would have been spent on health care.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
There are nine exceptions to the crowd-out policy in Florida law that would allow those children not to have go uninsured for two months. Exceptions are made, for example, if:

The cost of participation in an employer-sponsored health benefit plan is greater than 5% of the family’s income;
The parent lost a job that provided an employer-sponsored health benefit plan for children;
The parent who had health benefits coverage for the child is deceased;
Domestic violence led to loss of coverage; or
The employer of the parent canceled health benefits coverage for children;

Wednesday’s announcement says the change in policy will bring the program in alignment with federal policy and will take effect Jan. 1.
Kidcare is Florida’s version of the federal state children’s health insurance program. It is an optional Medicaid expansion for children whose families earn too much to qualify for the traditional Medicaid program.
Congress authorized the federal children’s health insurance program in 1997 and agreed to pay states roughly 15 percentage points more than the traditional Medicaid match rate. The Florida Legislature created Kidcare a year later. The federal government pays about 69 cents of every dollar spent on the program in Florida today.
The DeSantis administration is willing to alter its policy for children who lose private coverage but the requirement that they be precluded from enrolling in Kidcare for two months remains in state law.
While it’s willing to ignore the statutory lock-out for previously insured children, the DeSantis administration claims a different section of the Kidcare law prevents it from abiding by another federal requirement: that eligible children remain enrolled in the program for 12 months even if the family misses a monthly premium.
The DeSantis administration filed a lawsuit against the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in federal court in Tampa over that mandate. The challenge has lingered with little activity.
Meanwhile, the DeSantis administration has dropped tens of thousands of children from the program for failure to pay premiums. The Florida Phoenix obtained a report that showed 43,000 children were disenrolled from Kidcare for nonpayment of premiums between Sept. 1, 2024, and Aug. 31, 2025.
Of those, 25,806 children were re-enrolled sometime during the 12 months after paying their premiums. Another 17,430 children were never re-enrolled and may have become uninsured.
The legal skirmish has prevented the state from implementing a 2023 Florida law (HB 121) that increased eligibility for the program by boosting the maximum qualifying family income from 200% to 300% of the federal poverty level. That’s the difference between earning $64,300 for a family of four versus $96,450.
In addition to eliminating the 60-day waiting period, the DeSantis administration also said it was amending the CHIP State Plan to continue certain Kidcare benefits for 30 days following release from the program.

Monday’s announcement that Wyoming will receive a large tranche of federal funds to implement rural health transformation initiatives is only the beginning.
The post $205M federal health grant kicks off flurry of policy work for Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Health care advocates are celebrating Monday’s announcement that Wyoming will be awarded $205 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Project funds in 2026. 
But the announcement is only step one in a process that will require drafting contracts, hiring staff, crafting bills and gaining legislative approval. State workers, contractors and healthcare providers will have to hustle to lay the groundwork for programs they hope will shore up health care for the long term. 
“There’s real potential for this money to meaningfully improve health care in Wyoming, I think, as long as the other pieces come together and our state works as a team to implement the varying aspects,” Wyoming Medical Society Executive Director Sheila Bush said. “We have a lot of work in front of us, but it’s exciting work.”
The state’s highly rural nature and large land area create steep challenges: Ambulance response times can be long, clinics struggle to hire and retain medical professionals and hospitals fighting to stay viable have shed services like labor and delivery. 
Even if the federal award doesn’t live up to its promise of “transforming” Wyoming’s health care system, it presents a huge opportunity for improvements, advocates say. 
Wyoming’s application sketches out what those improvements might look like. They incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to prop up the industry.
The opportunity 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The program will funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. It aims to offset a portion of the federal funds for health care that were cut by the same legislation.
The application process for states unfolded rapidly. In Wyoming, Department of Health staff held stakeholder conferences and 11 public meetings starting in September to gather input. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. The application was then drawn up and submitted by the Nov. 5 deadline.

“Our biggest challenge lies in access to basic medical care,” Wyoming’s 84-page application stated.  
It went on to identify the state’s priorities of building the state’s health care workforce, improving residents’ metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioral health and using technology to improve chronic disease management and bring care closer to home. Some of the initiatives proposed to address those priorities include:

Build cooperative agreements for EMS agencies to work together on a regional basis, using regional dispatch to coordinate things like interfacility transfers.
Establish a state-operated public insurance plan, dubbed “BearCare,” that would cover health care emergencies, such as car crashes or bear attacks, for dues-paying members. 
Fund, in perpetuity, annual awards to cover educational costs for individuals interested in joining one of four clinical pipelines: nursing, EMS, behavioral health and physician.
Implement the Presidential Fitness Test in Wyoming’s primary and secondary schools.
Limit the state’s SNAP benefits to healthy food purchases by excluding things like sodas and candy. 
Stand up a grant process for technology to improve care delivery closer to home or build systems that can work across providers.
Establish a system of investments that can generate revenue for health care programs in perpetuity.

Wyoming applied for an initial budget of $200 million. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Monday that all 50 states will receive awards in 2026 under the program. Texas claimed the biggest prize, $281 million, while New Jersey received the smallest at $147 million. Wyoming got $5 million more than it asked for.
“The State of Wyoming has a smart and targeted plan to address our unique healthcare challenges,” said U.S. Sen. John Barrasso. The Wyoming doctor and Republican Majority Whip has championed the Rural Transformation Fund as a sensible solution while railing against expansion of the Affordable Care Act subsidies that expired Wednesday, leaving thousands of Wyoming residents facing significant spikes in insurance premiums.
Work ahead 
Implementing the application’s ambitious vision will require more staff, organization, many hours of work and the collaboration of several parties. With almost 1,400 employees in four divisions, the Wyoming health department is a “superagency” that’s well-equipped to helm the challenge, the application states. Still, it anticipates hiring around 13 contractors to address the additional load. 
The agency’s first task is to revise its budget to incorporate the award amount, said Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs. 
Then, next week, the Joint Appropriations Committee, which holds the state’s purse strings, will consider draft legislation related to the Rural Health Transformation Program proposals. Based on the committee’s initial reaction to some of the application’s components, that could present challenges. 
When the committee discussed the application during a December meeting, several lawmakers frowned on the state-run catastrophic health insurance plan.
“I’m not inclined to want to compete in the private sector. I don’t think it’s the proper role of government to do so,” said Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette. Bear was also skeptical of the proposed investment fund’s ability to keep pace with ever-rising health costs and to remain effective.

Along with hiring staff and getting related bills passed by skeptical lawmakers, health department staff also need to issue requests for proposals for various initiatives and draw up the attending contracts. 
For providers interested in applying for the program initiatives, Fuchs said, those opportunities will likely come later in the spring. 
If states do not spend the initial tranche of money within a certain time frame, Fuchs said, the feds will claw it back and redistribute it. Since the program is designed to divvy out $50 billion over five years, Wyoming could receive close to $1 billion when it’s all said and done.  
‘A heavy lift’ 
Wyoming Hospital Association President Eric Boley’s organization has been involved and closely following the process.
“The workforce part of it holds a lot of promise for us as we look at the shortages we’re already facing and the projected shortages in our country coming up in the next decade,” Boley said. He is also encouraged by the technological improvements that could be realized, hopes emergency services can be stabilized and said struggling hospitals will jump at opportunities to help realize financial viability.
“It’s gonna be a heavy lift, but I think our folks are ready to sit down at the table and see how we can make it work,” he said. “The devil’s in the details now.”
Wyoming Primary Care Association Executive Director Jen Davis is “cautiously optimistic” about the massive grant. “The reason I say that is because it’s a great opportunity to really do some amazing things in Wyoming, but I think we need to be really intentional, and I think we really need to focus on infrastructure for long-term sustainability and not just put out money to put out money.”
That will likely involve some hard conversations, she said. “I hope that now that it’s been awarded, there’ll be opportunities for a lot more participation as we go forward and figuring out how that looks.”
The award opens doors to opportunities Wyoming has never been able to fully consider before, said Bush of the Wyoming Medical Association. “However, these opportunities will only become a reality if the state comes together to pursue a unified vision.”

Leaders from four groups recognized as Abenaki by Vermont’s state government have created a new school curriculum about their communities’ history — but the material includes few references, they said, to two Abenaki nations centered in Quebec.
The distinction is notable because leaders of those Quebec-based nations continue to assert that many members of the groups in Vermont can’t claim legitimate Indigenous ancestry. Instead, the leaders from Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations say, members of the Vermont-based groups have been appropriating Abenaki identity and culture.
As the Quebec-based nations have made their case ever more forcefully in recent years, they’ve drawn sharp rebukes from leaders of the Vermont groups, who have moved to, as they tell it, defend their culture from attacks levied by former allies. 
Those groups, headquartered throughout Vermont, are the Elnu Abenaki, Nulhegan Abenaki, Koasek Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation and the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi. 
The new curriculum, announced earlier this month, is called the “American Abenaki Curriculum.” Its development was overseen by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs, which is a branch of state government tasked with advocating for the state-recognized groups. Some commissioners are also members of those groups. 
The educational materials include numerous digital resources and discussion topics for students in grades 3-12. Its central question, according to its website, is, “How have the Abenaki people survived and adapted to their environment for thousands of years?”
Odanak and Wôlinak’s tribal governments, in Canada, say they were wrongly excluded from the process of developing those materials. While the First Nations are headquartered north of Montreal, they have members in what they maintain is unceded territory in the northeastern U.S., including in Vermont.
The two nations’ governments issued a joint statement earlier this month assailing the American Abenaki Curriculum and calling it a “rewriting of history.”
“There is no such thing as ‘American Abenaki,’ as Abenaki identity and Ndakina — the ancestral homeland of the Abenaki people — predate colonial borders and cannot be redefined by modern administrative categories,” the nations’ press release said. 
“Presenting a curriculum in the name of a reconfigured identity to meet institutional imperatives amounts to trivializing the rewriting of history and normalizing cultural appropriation in public and educational spheres.”
Authors of the new curriculum said at a press conference Dec. 18 that they did not involve leaders from the Quebec-based nations because they were focused on history that is unique to the Vermont-recognized groups. The curriculum includes some of the same sources that the groups submitted to the state when applying for tribal recognition, the authors said.
The point of the curriculum is to focus “on the experiences of Vermonters,” said Dan Coutu, chair of the state Native American Affairs commission. Odanak and Wôlinak leaders “have their own voice,” he said, while the Vermont groups “have our voice.”
“They have their voice free to speak up, as they have. And now, it’s our turn,” Coutu added.
Vera Sheehan, a member of the Elnu group and one of the curriculum’s authors, said its website was largely complete but that more “bells and whistles” would be added in the coming months. The authors plan to create a printed version of the materials and launch a statewide outreach campaign to teachers, according to a press release from the Native American Affairs commission.
The press conference announcing the new curriculum turned contentious toward its end. After two reporters asked questions about the material, Denise Watso — an Odanak citizen who lives in Albany, New York, and said she was attending “as an observer” on behalf of the First Nation’s government — stood up and lambasted the curriculum as misleading. 
At that point, several people began speaking at the same time. Two other people then stood up and criticized the presentation, saying that it was wrong for Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations not to be consulted. Watso was escorted out of the room by a security guard.
The rollout of the curriculum is likely to spur at least some discussion in the Vermont Statehouse, too, after legislators return for a new session in January. That’s because Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, plans to introduce a bill that could, if passed, prevent the material as it’s been written from being used in schools.
Headrick’s legislation would require consultation with — and an endorsement from — Odanak and Wôlinak on any curriculum about Indigenous history before that material was used in any Vermont school, according to a draft of the bill.
“We’ve given these state-identified groups a foothold through the state recognition process,” Headrick said in an interview. “And they’re exploiting that foothold in a pretty significant way — taking control of the narrative in ways that completely erase any narrative provided by the Abenaki at Odanak and Wôlinak.”
Headrick said his bill has two additional sponsors, one Democratic and one Republican, though it’s not clear the proposal will have a clear path forward this session.

Headrick introduced a separate bill at the start of the 2025 legislative session, which ended this past June, that would create a task force to reexamine the state’s past tribal recognition decisions, among other points. The bill, H.362, got only a brief introductory hearing this year and did not see any substantive committee discussion time.
Conor Kennedy, chief of staff to Democratic House Speaker Jill Krowinski, said on Tuesday that he was not sure yet whether Headrick’s legislation would see more committee attention in the upcoming legislative session.
At the same time, the curriculum’s release comes as Odanak and Wôlinak leaders have made earnest appeals in Vermont this fall, including to state legislators, for the past tribal recognitions to be reconsidered. 
In October, the nations published a lengthy report that used public records to examine about 15 generations of ancestry for five prominent members of Vermont’s recognized groups, including Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan group; Brenda Gagne, chief of the ​​Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi; and Shirly Hook, chief of the Koasek group. 
The report also examined the heritage of some members of groups that claim Abenaki descent in New Hampshire, but that are not recognized by that state’s government. It concluded that all of the people studied were nearly 100% European.
Genealogical research for the report was conducted by Darryl Leroux, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa who has previously published research concluding that many members of Vermont’s state-recognized tribes have no ancestral ties to historic Abenaki communities. 
In a column published last month, Stevens, Gagne and Hook blasted the report and its findings as “junk science, compiled with bias and full of factual and interpretive errors.”
Odanak’s tribal government has emailed a link to the report to every state legislator in Vermont and New Hampshire, according to Suzie O’Bomsawin, the government’s assistant general manager.
Earlier this month, meanwhile, the First Nations launched a campaign on some of Vermont’s major television stations — ABC22, FOX44, WCAX and Vermont Public — which makes the case that the state-recognized tribes are not legitimate Indigenous communities. The campaign is set to air for a year, according to a press release. 
“It is essential that everyone understand the reality of our identity,” said Jacques Watso, one of Odanak First Nation’s tribal councilors, in the release. “We will continue this work with consistency and determination. The truth cannot be ignored.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utahns who lose track of time while ringing in the new year and stay out too late to take public transit home have another option. 
The Utah Transit Authority is offering to help cover the cost of Uber or Lyft rides for those who miss the last train or bus on New Year’s Eve.  
The agency announced on its website that it will pay up to $25 for Lyft or Uber rides for stranded drivers from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., “while supplies last.” 
Those looking to get a discounted ride home during the three-hour timeframe should call the UTA ReConnect program at 801-RIDE-UTA (801-743-3882) or check the agency’s transit app for a Lyft or Uber code. 
For Utahns seeking wheelchair-accessible vehicles, UTA police said they will help arrange transportation from Yellow Cab Utah for those who call (801) 287-3937. 
The Utah Department of Public Safety is also offering $10 Lyft credits to encourage people to plan sober rides home. The credits are accessible through a QR code on the department’s website. 
Alcohol-related deaths made up nearly 1 in 5 traffic fatalities from 2020 to 2024, according to the agency. It also said law enforcement agencies throughout the state have scheduled 300 extra DUI enforcement shifts from December 10 through New Year’s Day.
In 2018, Utah became the first state in the nation to lower its blood alcohol content limit for drivers from 0.08% to 0.05.

Tate Reeves has granted clemency to two men sentenced to prison terms beyond the maximum allowed.","After more than five years in office, Gov. Tate Reeves first exercised his power to grant executive clemency earlier this month when he ordered the release of Marcus Taylor, who had been wrongly sentenced to five years longer than the maximum sentence for his charge.
Now, he has exercised that constitutional authority again, this time to free Taylor’s twin brother Maurice. 
On Dec. 31, Reeves signed Executive Order 1591, directing the Mississippi Department of Corrections to release Maurice Taylor within five days. 
“A couple of weeks ago, my office was contacted for the first time by Maurice Taylor’s post-conviction counsel and provided a copy of Mr. Taylor’s indictment, plea petition, sentencing order, transcript of the sentencing hearing and other documents from the Circuit Court file,” Reeves posted on his X account Wednesday. “These documents confirm that, like his brother, Maurice Taylor received a sentence more than three times longer than allowed under Mississippi law.” 
In February 2015, Maurice Taylor pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to sell a controlled substance, an offense that carries a maximum sentence of five years. However, the Choctaw County Circuit Court in its judgment sentenced him to 20 years in MDOC custody with five suspended, a sentence 10 years longer than the maximum for his offense. 
According to court papers, the sentencing judgment misidentified the offense as business burglary and imposed an illegal sentence. In 2016, the trial court entered a corrected judgment identifying the proper offense but failed to correct the sentence.
Reeves’ executive order notes that Taylor began serving his sentence on March 6, 2014, meaning that he has, to date, served more than 11 years for an offense that carried a maximum sentence of five, thus constituting a “miscarriage of justice.”
“When justice is denied to even one Mississippian, it is denied to us all,” Reeves said.
Similarly, Marcus Taylor, who was indicted with his brother, was convicted in 2015 for a drug sale charge that was meant to have a five-year maximum sentence. Instead, he received 15 years. 
But unlike his brother, the Mississippi Court of Appeals voted 8-2 to release him. The attorney general’s office asked the court to vacate its decision after Reeves’ granted the 43-year-old clemency.

But fear not, we’ve assembled this year-end compilation to pry the cobwebs from your random-access memory. 
What follows is a collection of Louisiana political news you’ve simply forgotten or just don’t care to remember.
January
Some 290 employees at the University of New Orleans learned they would be furloughed through midyear to start 2025, and another 30 were laid off at the end of the month. Nearly every staff member making more than $30,000 annually was required to take unpaid time off during each two-week pay period. Lower-paid staff had to take a day and a half of unpaid time off per pay period, while the highest paid took three days off every two workweeks. UNO leaders also combined some posts, placing deans in charge of multiple colleges to eliminate administrative positions.   
The family-owned company once run by President Donald Trump’s campaign co-chair in Louisiana agreed to pay $1.025 million to resolve allegations that it hired workers ineligible to work in the United States.Bollinger Shipyard of Lockport was accused of violating the False Claims Act for knowingly billing the U.S. Coast Guard for the labor the illegal workers performed. The company’s settlement with the federal government is not an admission of guilt but effectively brought the matter to a close. 
Federal authorities released the findings of an investigation that revealed a pattern of unlawful conduct within the Louisiana State Police, including troopers’ use of excessive force, lack of accountability and other problems in “every corner of the state.” The U.S. Department of Justice review was prompted by the May 2019 killing of Ronald Greene, a 49-year-old Black man, in police custody. He was beaten while handcuffed and shackled face down on the side of a highway, pleading with the troopers and a local deputy following a vehicle pursuit near Monroe.
A Baton Rouge-area grand jury indicted a New York physician and a Louisiana mother on felony charges for allegedly providing an illegal abortion with drugs obtained through the mail. It’s the first criminal case of its kind in the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion  in 2022, which triggered Louisiana’s strict abortion ban. Attorney General Liz Murrill’s efforts to extradite Dr. Margaret Carpenter from New York to face criminal consequences in Louisiana have run into that state’s shield laws.
February   
State tax Judge Cade Cole automatically became the newest member of the Louisiana Supreme Court after being the only candidate to sign up for an election to fill the court’s open seat. He represents District 3, which stretches from Calcasieu Parish to Caddo Parish.
The Louisiana State Civil Service Commission denied a request from Gov. Jeff Landry to remove protected status from 900 positions in state government. Many of the jobs under the proposal were within the Department of Transportation and Development, though it would not have affected any current employees.With the Legislature’s backing, the governor would later take steps to reorganize the transportation department and create a new entity under his office with the goal of expediting prioritized infrastructure projects.
Louisiana utility regulators sanctioned one of their colleagues after he called the governor an “a–hole” on social media. In a 3-2 vote along party lines, the Louisiana Public Service Commission removed Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, as vice chair of the panel and installed Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, R-Metairie, in his place. 
LSU marked more than 1,300 of its webpages for review because they include the terms “diversity,” “equity,  “inclusion” and “DEI.” The scrutiny came in response to guidance from the Trump administration after his threats to revoke federal funding from campuses that use race-conscious practices in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships and other aspects of student life.

March
Following the lead of the White House, the governor signed an executive order that directed state agencies to change all references to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana laws and other documents to the “Gulf of America.”
Jessie Hoffman was put to death at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, becoming the first person in the state executed using nitrogen gas. It also marked the first time Louisiana carried out the death penalty in 15 years.A second condemned man who was scheduled for execution the next day, 81-year-old Christopher Sepulvado, died in February.
Landry declared a state of emergency to immediately address system outages at the state Office of Motor Vehicles that caused crippling delays in processing drivers’ licenses, vehicle titles and registration services. 
In a stunning rejection of the governor’s agenda, Louisiana voters turned down all four of his constitutional amendments, including his plan to overhaul the state’s tax and budget laws.  Nearly two-thirds of voters rejected all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s time as governor.
April
A Plaquemines Parish jury ruled Chevron must pay the local government more than $740 million, blaming the company for decades of damage to its wetlands. The ruling is the first among several lawsuits from coastal parishes in Louisiana that want the oil and gas industry to compensate them for carving up swamps and marshland with canals. Local officials contend the vast work related to energy exploration and pipelines has gradually exacerbated the natural depletion of coastal areas.The case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, where a precedent could be set for several other parishes pursuing similar damages from fossil fuel corporations.  
Gov. Landry hired Bruce Greenstein as Louisiana Department of Health secretary, returning him to the role he held under former Gov. Bobby Jindal from 2010-13. During that earlier stint, Greenstein was charged with lying to a state grand jury under oath to oversee billions of dollars of spending. He was forced out of the job after Jindal discovered the federal government was investigating Greenstein’s role in the award of a nearly $200 million state Medicaid contract to Greenstein’s previous employer. The federal government did not bring charges against Greenstein, and he was never convicted on state charges. 
The University of Louisiana Lafayette shut down its Office of Campus Inclusion. The closure was done “in compliance with a federal directive,” according to an email sent to university employees. 
A judge set aside the first-degree murder conviction and death sentence of Jimmie Duncan, whose 1998 conviction in Ouachita Parish for killing his girlfriend’s 23-month-old daughter was based in part on bite mark evidence that experts now say is junk science.

May
Aurelia Giacometto, the embattled secretary of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, made her exit from the agency. The governor appointed Courtney Burdette to fill the vacancy. Giacometto’s departure followed a year of tumult that began with high-ranking LDEQ executives resigning and publicly airing their complaints about her alleged harassment of subordinates. It was also brought to light that Giacometto used public money to travel to out-of-state political events with no obvious connection to her position in state government. 
LSU President William Tate was named the next leader of Rutgers University in New Jersey, becoming the most notable in a string of abrupt, high-profile departures from Louisiana’s flagship public university.  
After outcry from several corners of the legal community, Louisiana lawmakers scuttled a controversial proposal Attorney General Liz Murrill backed that could have moved thousands of criminal cases involving children and teenagers from juvenile to adult courts every year. The Louisiana Senate Finance Committee voted 6-5 to reject legislation that would have mostly affected Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes, where juvenile courts operate separately from district courts. The decision came a few weeks after state voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar constitutional amendment. 
Republicans in the Louisiana Senate overwhelmingly rejected a bill to allow people convicted by non-unanimous juries before 2018 to petition for their cases to be reviewed. The proposal failed on a 9-26 vote despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, who’s long campaigned on a tough-on-crime platform.
A proposal to end the addition of fluoride to public drinking water in Louisiana failed in the legislature following passionate testimony from health care and dental professionals.
June
Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a set of dramatic changes to state ethics laws that will make it much more difficult to charge elected officials and public employees with misconduct. One measure alters the process the state ethics board used to bring charges against Landry two years ago that are still pending and won’t be affected by the legislation. The governor’s personal attorney, Stephen Gelé, helped craft the language contained in it.
Beyond making it harder to bring ethics charges, the legislation also loosens limits on elected officials’ and state employees’ in-state travel, weakens restrictions on government contracts with public servants and their families, and reduces requirements for elected officials and political candidates’ disclosure of financial interests.
The legislature overwhelmingly approved a $53 billion budget without funding for Landry’s signature, private education voucher initiative, one that he initially celebrated with much fanfare. Legislative leaders, especially in the Senate, had said for the past year that they weren’t going to fund the LA GATOR program.
The eight-week legislative session ended with lawmakers backing the less stringent of two measures aimed at regulating pharmacy benefit managers, the “middlemen” operations that oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers.  Landry threatened to bring lawmakers back to Baton Rouge for a special session to lower prescription drug prices but opted not to follow through. 
A federal appeals court blocked a Louisiana law that requires public K-12 schools, colleges and universities to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom. A three-judge panel from the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional because it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another. The full 5th Circuit is scheduled to reconsider the panel ruling in January. Attorney General Liz Murrill has said she would take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed.
July
While standing on the deck of a friend’s yacht in Bermuda, Landry praised a new Louisiana tax break on boat purchases in a short video he shared to social media. What the governor didn’t mention is the tax break, which took effect July 1, only applies to boats worth $200,000 or more.
The governor renamed the state’s largest National Guard training site after a little-known early 19th century Louisiana militia member and slaveowner, the father of the Confederate general whose name the facility originally carried. Landry announced the renaming of Camp Beauregard in Pineville  with a social media post that included a seemingly AI-generated image of a headstone that reads “Wokeism.” 
Rebecca Harris, a veteran state employee, was tapped to lead Louisiana’s child welfare agency, replacing David Matlock, the former juvenile judge who held the role for the first 18 months of the Landry administration.
A proclamation from President Trump allowed 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 with sites in Louisiana, to ignore new federal rules meant to contain harmful emissions.

August
Landry declared a state emergency to address what he said was lack of capacity to house violent offenders at Louisiana State Penitentiary. The proclamation allowed state officials to expedite repairs at Camp J, a section of the Angola prison shut down eight years earlier for security reasons. It would be reopened in September to house detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
District maps for seats in the Louisiana Legislature violate the federal Voting Rights Act, a panel of judges on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. Their decision upholds a lower court ruling that found the boundaries discriminated against Black voters.The 5th Circuit has since put the case in a holding pattern while the U.S. Supreme Court considers Louisiana v. Callais, which challenges the state’s second Black-majority district in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Later in August, Attorney General Murrill filed a brief in the Callais case that argues a key provision of the Voting Rights Act violates the U.S. Constitution. If justices agree, it could limit the extent race can be considered in the redistricting process nationwide. 
State utility regulators approved a plan to install three natural-gas fueled power plants for the tech company Meta, which needs the electricity for a massive data center it’s building in Northeast Louisiana. Shaving two months off its usual approval process, the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted 4-1 to advance the unprecedented project from Entergy Louisiana to supply a massive amount of power for a single customer. 
New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell made history, becoming the city’s first mayor to be indicted while in office, after federal prosecutors charged her with multiple counts of wire fraud, obstruction of justice and lying to a grand jury. Cantrell, who leaves office in January, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
September
The Louisiana Board of Ethics dropped formal charges against Gov. Landry for failing to disclose flights he took on a political donor’s private plane when he was attorney general. In return, Landry agreed to admit publicly to other instances in which he failed to disclose free travel he accepted from business groups and political contributors.The board also fined the governor $900, though Landry could have faced tens of thousands of dollars of penalties for failing to disclose the gifts. 
Planned Parenthood clinics in Baton Rouge and New Orleans were among those that closed or had to scramble for funding to stay open at the end of September after the Trump administration blocked Medicaid funding for certain reproductive health organizations.
The Landry administration has failed to provide oversight of public money given to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers as required by state law, according to a report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office. 
Attorney General Murrill issued an arrest warrant for a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Louisiana woman  — the latest legal volley in an ongoing fight between states with abortion bans and those that have enacted protections for abortion providers who use telemedicine to send abortion medication over state lines.  
October
Attorney General Murrill filed a lawsuit that calls on the federal government to strike down rules that allow the distribution of abortion drugs without an in-person doctor’s visit. It’s her latest attempt to place restrictions on out-of-state shipments of mifepristone, a medication used to terminate pregnancies but that also has other life-saving and gynecological uses.
New Orleans Councilwoman at-large Helena Moreno scored a resounding win in the city’s mayoral primary election, securing 55% of the vote, above the simple majority she needed to clinch the job without a runoff election.
A Cameron Parish judge ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal. The decision found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility. In November, the state agency reissued its approval with a new set of reasons for its endorsement, leading to a lawsuit from environmentalists. 
Gov. Landry summoned the Louisiana Legislature for a three-week special session to address the 2026 election calendar with hopes of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the state’s challenge of its current U.S. House districts. While the qualifying schedule was pushed back one week for next year’s congressional midterms, justices have not issued a ruling on a timeline that would give state lawmakers enough time to redraw the districts.
November
The LSU Board of Supervisors named Wade Rousse its next system president and picked University of Alabama Provost Jim Dalton as chancellor of its Baton Rouge campus. The dual hires mark the first time the university will have separate system and main campus leaders since the roles were merged in 2012. 
Clay Schexnayder, former speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, was charged with felony theft in connection with a missing piece of historic cypress that had been on display at the State Capitol and was last seen at his legislative office in Gonzales. Schexnayder denies knowing of the relic’s whereabouts.
Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder 40 years ago and sentenced to life in prison, was elected clerk of Orleans Parish Criminal Court, handily defeating an established incumbent. The campaign saw Attorney General Murrill challenge Duncan’s claim that he had been exonerated. Court records confirm Duncan’s conviction was vacated in 2021.
Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, who rolled back government vaccine distribution as the state’s top public health official, was appointed by President Trump to the second highest position at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Southern University System took steps to move on from its current leader, Dennis Shields, who has been president and main campus chancellor since 2022.

December
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System Board of Supervisors voted to name state Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson as its next system leader. Nelson will replace current President Monty Sullivan, who is retiring after serving in the position since 2014. Nelson will officially take office Jan. 1. 
A federal immigration enforcement campaign began in earnest in Louisiana, the latest area of focus for the Trump administration’s sweeps, detentions and deportations.  Operation Catahoula Crunch began with agents fanning out from their New Orleans base into suburban areas to apprehend day laborers outside home improvement stores and workers at restaurants and construction sites.
The Landry administration abruptly ended contracts with two of the six companies that provide Medicaid insurance in Louisiana, only to reverse course on its deal with Aetna and offer a three-month extension to UnitedHealthcare. UnitedHealthcare has opted to pull its business from Louisiana once its extension lapses March 31, meaning some 330,000 people will need to move to new Medicaid plans.
The Louisiana Supreme Court refused the state attorney general’s request to return a convicted killer to death row, though it doesn’t necessarily derail Liz Murrill’s plans to challenge a U.S. Supreme Court precedent that declared executing minors was unconstitutional.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Lewis and Clark County District Court judge has suspended Hamilton Sen. Jason Ellsworth from public office as the court considers charges that he engaged in official misconduct by procuring a $170,000 contract for a friend and business associate in his final days as Senate president.
Judge Kathy Seeley issued the order earlier this month, writing “the Court finds probable cause to believe the Defendant has committed the alleged criminal offense.”
Ellsworth could not be reached for comment by phone or text this week, but a lawyer who has represented him in the past said Ellsworth will challenge the order.
Lawyer Joan Mell she found it “very surprising” Seeley would grant the order “without a hearing and any fact-finding.”
The Montana Attorney General’s Office submitted the request for suspension, along with its charging documents, after a months-long investigation.
Ellsworth’s actions late last year were first reported by the Montana State News Bureau in the early days of the 2025 legislative session and became a dominant narrative throughout lawmakers’ time in Helena.
Ellsworth was originally investigated by the Legislative Auditor in a waste, fraud and abuse hotline case that found Ellsworth abused his power and wasted state resources. The auditor referred the investigation to the DOJ in February.
A separate investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee led to a full-chamber vote stripping Ellsworth of nearly all his responsibilities and privileges of office, making the court-ordered suspension mostly a formality.
Mell, Ellsworth’s civil attorney who represented him throughout the Ethics Committee investigation but is not his criminal attorney in the current case, told the Daily Montanan in a phone call that the information in the charging documents “is just highly suspect and just wrong.”
“He is definitely going to challenge the order on a variety of grounds, not the least which is legislative immunity and separation of powers problems,” Mell said.
According to court documents, Ellsworth is scheduled for an initial appearance on Jan. 6.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)It’s the biggest mystery to hit the central Arkansas town of Cabot, not to mention the rest of the state: Who purchased the winning $1.8 billion Powerball ticket?
Locals speculate on who the big winner of last week’s jackpot is, and whether there’s a new billionaire in their midst. Area charities are hopeful it’s a donor who’s willing to share the wealth.
“If I go into a local grocery store, if I go into anywhere in town, someone asks me about it,” House Speaker Brian Evans of Cabot said “Typically, it’s, ‘hey Brian, hey were you the winner?’”
Evans is quick to point out that he wasn’t.
A spokesperson for the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery said as of Wednesday morning a winner of the Powerball jackpot hadn’t stepped forward, and thanks to a nearly five-year-old state law their identity may remain a secret for a while longer. 
Arkansas is one of several states that allow some form of anonymity for lottery winners, and supporters of such secrecy say the Powerball jackpot poses the type of security risks they were hoping to address.
The 2021 Arkansas law allows lottery winners of more than $500,000 to remain confidential for three years. For elected officials and their immediate family who win, that anonymity is limited to six months.
Former state Sen. Larry Teague said he didn’t imagine a jackpot of this magnitude when he sponsored the legislation. But Teague said he wanted to give larger lottery winners a chance to get their affairs in order before their names were publicized around the state or country.
“There are a lot of things you’d have to do to protect yourself,” Teague said. “I wanted to make it where they would have time to work through what they needed to.”
Whoever won last week will have a lot to work through. The $1.8 billion winning ticket was the largest in Arkansas’ history and the second largest in the history of the multistate Powerball game. The winner will have the choice between an annuitized prize of more than $1.8 billion or a lump sum payment of nearly $835 million. Both amounts are before taxes.
The secrecy measure had its critics. Press groups opposed it for expanding the government records that were exempt from being disclosed to the public. Opponents also said that keeping that information confidential could hamper efforts to market the state’s lottery.
“In order to sell tickets, you have to publicize the winners,” then-Sen. Keith Ingram said during floor debate on the measure.
Evans and Sen. Ricky Hill, whose district also includes Cabot, both voted for the anonymity measure in 2021.
“The biggest issue is privacy, with people coming out of the blue saying they’re your cousin,” Hill said.
Local residents are for now left to wonder who bought the winning ticket. The Murphy USA gas station where the ticket was purchased sits in front of a Walmart Supercenter, and it’s uncertain whether the winner is from Cabot, one of the surrounding communities or someone who was just passing through.

This would be Mississippi's fifth data center project.,"Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, has purchased a new building in Southaven to boost its computing power. 
This is the tech company’s latest expansion into Mississippi. The property at 2400 Stateline Road is a short drive from xAI’s natural gas power plant that the company bought in July 2025. The former Duke Power plant will power xAI’s two data centers across the state line in Memphis. 
According to property records, MZX Tech, an LLC associated with xAI, purchased the property on Dec. 23.
“xAI has bought a third building called MACROHADRR,” Elon Musk wrote on Tuesday in a tweet on X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk added that the building would expand the company’s computing power to almost 2 gigawatts. 
The company has not said what it plans for the warehouse. However, The Information, a tech publication, reported that the building will be used as a data center.
If true, this would bring the total number of data center projects in Mississippi to five. 
xAI’s power plant already faces community pushback. Residents of Southaven have raised concerns about noise levels and environmental concerns.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — One thing is certain about 2026: Politicians will make a lot of promises about cutting South Carolina taxes.
How much will be cut? And which tax?
Don’t believe candidates for the Governor’s Mansion (in either party) who pledge that they will eliminate state income taxes — no matter how loudly or how often they say it. For starters, the South Carolina governor doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally change tax policy. Period. That is entirely up to the 170-member Legislature.
Sen. Sean Bennett, who a year ago was considering a bid for governor, calls those campaign promises “pie in the sky.”
“They sound good, particularly in election years on the stump: ‘Let’s just eliminate our income tax,'” said the Summerville Republican.
The financial planner calculates the move would require at least doubling the state’s 6% sales tax: “I wish we wouldn’t waste time chasing that shiny lure.”
He is hopeful, however, about traction on the type of sweeping changes to the state tax code he’s advocated for years.
Legislation that further cuts state income taxes is in the Senate’s court, after passing the House by a vote of 68-46 in May during the last week of the 2025 legislative session.
What Congress did two months later provided a boost to state House GOP leadership’s arguments, though probably not in the way you’d think.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which President Donald Trump signed July 4, is expected to reduce state income taxes by $515.4 million in the fiscal year starting July 1, according to a recent analysis by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. The state’s revenue forecasters expect the federal law to further reduce collections by $244 million in 2027-28 and $251 million in 2028-29, when some of its major provisions — such as no taxes on tips or overtime — will phase out, leaving tax impacts beyond that a mystery.
But there’s a giant “if” in those predictions. The reductions will occur if the Legislature adopts the federal tax code changes.
That’s what the General Assembly normally does: South Carolina is among just a handful of states to tax “federal taxable income.”
The argument for decoupling
But a major reason that House Republicans gave last session in pushing their tax restructuring plan was to decouple South Carolina’s income tax code from the federal system.
House GOP leaders recently told the SC Daily Gazette they believe the Trump-signed tax law — and state forecasters’ analysis of its impact to state tax collections — increase the need for South Carolina to untether and do its own thing.
“It shows what happens when we give away the tax-making authority of the General Assembly to Washington,” said Rep. Brandon Newton of Lancaster, chairman of House Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, which advanced the bill he co-sponsored.
“We can’t be at the mercy of whatever D.C. does, whether it’s President Trump or President AOC,” he continued, referring to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, while stressing, “even though I agree with the changes made by President Trump.”
More importantly for the bill’s chances, the Senate’s budget chief agrees.
“We want to decouple from the feds,” said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney. “South Carolina doesn’t need to depend on Congress.”
Bennett, who chairs two of Senate Finance’s regular subcommittees, believes the “Big Beautiful Bill” not only strengthens the case that state tax collections should not be “dependent on the whims of the federal government,” it highlights the need for a total overhaul.
“Let us decouple and put together a South Carolina-focused, South Carolina-centric tax policy that supports our budget,” he said.
For him, that means making changes to the entire tax structure, not just further chipping away at income taxes. And for the first time in his 13 years in the Senate, he said, he senses a real possibility of that happening.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said the debate should include finding a way to reduce property taxes. Those are the taxes he gets the most complaints about, he said, even though they’re collected by counties, not the state, to fund local government services and schools.
“I’m all for a further reduction in income taxes,” said the Edgefield Republican. However, “I don’t have any constituents telling me we should eliminate income taxes.”
Changing appearances
The bill passed by the House would reduce income tax collections overall by $400.3 million in year one.
House GOP advances new plan that initially cuts SC income taxes by $400M

That would not, however, benefit all taxpayers immediately. Whether you would pay less in the proposal’s first year depends on your income and how you file: 42% of filers would see a cut, 24% would owe more, while 33% would see no change whatsoever, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
That’s an improvement from the bill as originally filed, which Republicans announced with much fanfare in the Statehouse lobby before the state’s fiscal experts could dissect it — an odd, cart-before-the-horse move. After their analysis showed the bill would actually increase taxes for nearly 60% of filers, the public backlash prompted a rewrite.
The amended bill collapses the state’s three tax rates into two, instead of moving to a single flat tax rate immediately, while promising to get there through a multi-year phase-in.
House GOP leaders point to the 2022 law that cut income taxes by more than $1 billion as proof that will happen sooner than later. That phase-in was expected to take five years. Instead, it was completed by the budget that took effect July 1.
That law passed unanimously in both chambers. Opposition to the current House GOP plan comes from two directions: The hardline House Freedom Caucus insists on the immediate elimination of state income taxes — which, by the way, still make up more than 40% of the state’s general fund revenue. Democrats argue it’s unnecessary and potentially harmful to the state’s fiscal health.
As I wrote back in April about the original bill, the push wasn’t really about cutting taxes — at least, not in year one. It’s about removing what the House’s chief budget writer, Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, calls the state’s “glaring black eye”: a tax structure that seems to be the highest in the Southeast, even though it’s not.
Even with completion of the 2022 law, the state’s top marginal income tax rate is 6%. That appears uncompetitive to our neighbors and beyond. Politicians like to point to that 6% rate when they tell voters that South Carolinians pay the highest taxes in the region. That claim is malarkey.
Because South Carolina taxes “federal taxable income,” rather than adjusted gross income as most states do, South Carolinians start their state tax forms with less income to tax, compared to what they’d file if they lived across the state border.
Their effective tax rate — what people actually pay — is comparatively low. Roughly 45% of tax filers actually pay no state income taxes at all.
Republicans want a “fair and flat” tax code that makes South Carolina stand out as a low-tax state, rather than appear the opposite. But numbers can be deceiving. That’s why the original proposal that brought the tax rate to a flat 3.99% in one fell swoop actually increased most people’s taxes.
If the Legislature adopts the tax code changes in the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” the overall cut to state income taxes would be bigger in the coming fiscal year: $515 million compared to the House GOP plan’s $400 million.
But the state’s tax rate would still appear out of whack.
“We’d still have the sticker shock problem,” Bannister told the Gazette.
“We need to get the rate down,” he said. “If we cut $500 million, we ought to do it in a way that lets us celebrate a historic tax rate decrease, not just that we’re following the feds.”
The House GOP plan would further put in state law the goal of someday, eventually eliminating state income taxes.
Just conforming to the federal code would make it “almost impossible” to also pass a bill restructuring state taxes, Bannister said.
The next move will be decided in Peeler’s committee after the Legislature returns Jan. 13.
The House bill, said the Gaffney Republican, is “heading in the right direction.”
Peeler said he wants to make sure whatever the Senate passes is an actual tax cut — a not-so-veiled swipe at the original House plan.
And, further emphasizing that the Senate will pass something, he repeated a line he’s known to make: “You can’t out-cut Harvey Peeler.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/income-tax-newser-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 15:56:58.768344

The Administrative Procedures Act ensures government accountability by making agencies transparent, require public participation, setting fair rulemaking standards, and allowing courts to review actions for legality and rationality.”Thompson found that Noem did not sufficiently review country conditions or provide a minimum six-month winding-down period leading to the end of temporary legal status, a practice that the agency has followed for decades.“Taken together, the Court finds that the Secretary improperly narrowed the scope of her review of the conditions of the countries at issue in this litigation before making her termination decision,” Thompson said. “The Secretary’s narrowing was based on an erroneous reading of the TPS statute and history of DHS practice.” A country receives a TPS designation if it meets certain conditions, such as a major natural disaster, violence, or some other instability that makes a country too dangerous for its citizens’ return. About 52,000 TPS recipients hail from Honduras, more than 7,100 are nationals from Nepal and nearly 3,000 TPS holders are from Nicaragua. The judge also denied the Department of Justice’s motion to dismiss the case. “Our laws should not favor the loud and powerful simply because of their positions. Yet, for too long, our laws have overlooked the quiet truths—truths carried in the margins, truths lived but never spoken aloud,” Thompson said.“It is the duty of every public servant entrusted with shaping a more just society to bring those truths into the open, to translate lived experience into written protection. It means hearing the faintest whisper of injustice and refusing to let it fade. It means honoring the people who call this country home but have never been invited to speak in it. It means finally ensuring that the law speaks for them,” she continued.DHS did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.All three country designations were set to expire by September, but in July, Thompson halted the terminations. In late August, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the TPS terminations to continue, meaning that work authorizations for those recipients expired.  Separately, another judge in Boston, Massachusetts temporarily halted the TPS termination for more than 200 nationals from South Sudan on Tuesday, also finding a move by Noem is likely unlawful. TPS for South Sudan is set to expire Jan. 6. This year, the Trump administration has aggressively moved to revoke the legal status of TPS recipients, and those with some other form of humanitarian legal status. So far, about 1 million immigrants under TPS, along with another half a million, have lost their status.",,,,2025-12-31 14:58:15.602295

In his veto letter, the president blamed the tribe for having “actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”
‘Dragging its feet’: ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ appeal paused due to government shutdown

“My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country,” Trump wrote. 
The tribe is part of a lawsuit against the state, claiming planners behind the immigration detention facility, also dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility. 
Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Republican from Miami, sponsored the bill, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, passed by both chambers of Congress via voice votes. 
The bill called upon the Secretary of the Interior and the tribe “to take appropriate actions to safeguard structures within the Osceola Camp from flooding events.”
The Osceola Camp in the Everglades is a residential area for the Miccosukee tribe but not part of the federally reserved area for the tribe.
The bill, introduced nearly a year ago, four days before Trump’s second term began, also would’ve expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include the Osceola Camp.
Gimenez’s office said the bill would help with “strengthening the Tribe’s governance and enhancing infrastructure within the community.”
“This bipartisan legislation ensures that the Miccosukee tribe has the legal authority to manage, protect, and preserve their land, and continue their traditional way of life,” Gimenez said on the House floor in July, going on to say the bill “is about fairness and conservation.”

“Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts and restoring fiscal sanity is vital to economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation. This principle carries especially heavy weight here; it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy,” Trump wrote. 
The bill does not have a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate.

Sensory exercises like this are often used in special education classrooms. (Getty Images)From significant actions in the long-running Yazzie/Martinez educational equity lawsuit to upheavals in federal funding priorities, New Mexico public school staff, administrators and students faced a variety of challenges in 2025.
On the home front, New Mexico’s landmark educational equity lawsuit returned to court in the spring, when the court ordered the New Mexico Public Education Department to complete a remedial plan to address the needs and outcomes of at-risk students. In September, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the state would be the first in the country to offer universal free child care by Nov. 1.
At the national level, President Donald Trump’s efforts to reduce diversity, equity and inclusion programs resulted in federal funding delays and cancellations to states, including New Mexico, for various educational efforts and research at higher education institutions. The federal government’s Oct. 1 to Nov. 12 shutdown this year also threatened Head Start programs across the state with closing or losing their federal grant funding.

Parties returned to court in the spring after plaintiffs in the case claimed the state had not made enough progress toward improving opportunities and support for Native students, English language learners, students from low-income families and students with disabilities. The court agreed and ordered the PED to develop a remedial action plan.
Judge sides with plaintiffs in Yazzie/Martinez NM education equity case

The final draft of the plan was recently submitted to the court for review. However, plaintiffs, represented by New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, and educational advocates quickly criticized the plan through the development phase as being “too vague.” 
Parties in the case now have time to submit formal objections and responses to the plan before First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson makes a determination whether the PED’s remedial plan complies with his order. Wilson recently granted the plaintiff’s motion for more time to submit their response, pushing the deadline to February. 
A spokesperson for Transform Education New Mexico, a coalition of educational advocacy organizations, told Source New Mexico in a written statement that while the PED took “initial steps” this year toward including the voices of stakeholders, the department’s plan “still falls short of what students need and what the court requires.”
“It’s clear that the central challenge remains how to turn legal mandates into meaningful, lasting change for New Mexico students,” TENM Communications Director Meryl Chee said. “The opportunity now is to make partnership structural rather than symbolic—ensuring that students, families, educators, and communities closest to the classroom are shaping strategy, implementation, and accountability, not just offering feedback.”
Chee added that the coalition’s hope for 2026 is “deeper collaboration and concrete actions” that move the state toward fulfilling the court’s rulings in the lawsuit.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, alongside Early Childhood Education and Care Department Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky, announced in September that the state would become the first in the U.S. to offer universal free child care before the end of the year, a gambit that quickly drew national attention
 ECECD was tasked with changing the rules to remove the income eligibility threshold for child care assistance, which previously waived copays for parents whose income was up to 400% of the federal poverty level.
New Mexico governor announces free universal child care

The rule change is intended to expand access to child care, allow parents to maintain their jobs, increase child care worker pay and strengthen the economy. However, capacity issues may hamper the progress toward achieving universal free child care. Experts pointed out in October that there may not be enough child care centers to care for the children the program intends to assist, and there are too few available spots. And such issues could be worse in more rural areas of the state.
Lori Martinez, executive director of the educational advocacy organization Ngage New Mexico, told Source in a written statement that she believes the state must prioritize child care assistance for families most in need and create a “solid” plan for recruitment and retention of quality workforce to make the universal program sustainable. 
“Starting with funding and implementation of the Wage and Career Ladder, which was a requirement in the legislation that created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019,” Martinez said. 
She added that early childhood educators should be recognized, and adequately compensated, for their role in supporting “the health and well-being” of New Mexico communities. “High quality child care is early childhood education, and contributes to school readiness as well as economic growth and quality of life in our communities,” Martinez said.

Changes in federal funding, federal government shut down impact programs

Federal upheaval touched most sectors of New Mexico, including education at all levels. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take steps to shut down the Department of Education. Not long after, the department ordered state education leaders to certify their compliance with a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion practices or risk lost funding. These announcements led to uncertainty among state education departments and school districts regarding what funding would be released, when it might be released and whether it would be released at all.
Research universities in New Mexico have also been hard hit by federal fund freezes and reductions. A report provided to state lawmakers in mid-November noted that the state’s research facilities face up to $95 million in lost federal funding.
While the Trump administration’s actions have been challenged and, often, refuted in the courts, efforts to dismantle the federal department remain ongoing. The Trump administration has also withheld funding throughout the year, including $6.8 billion last summer for K-12 programs (some of which was subsequently released). 
Changes to federal funding, social programs mean more uncertainty for NM public education

Uncertainty over federal funding came to a head in October when federal lawmakers failed to pass a budget, resulting in a month-and-a-half-long government shutdown. Head Start, a federally funded program that offers early childhood educational opportunities and support for low-income families, was one program the Trump Administration was already considering ending. 
As the government shutdown extended, concerns over operational funding and keeping Head Start programs running in New Mexico ramped up. And even after the shutdown ended, New Mexico’s congressional delegation demanded the U.S. Health and Human Services Department release grant reimbursements for New Mexico programs, including three tribal programs.
NM delegation calls for feds to release Head Start money

Nonetheless, state leaders remain resolute. ECECD Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky told Source in a written statement that her department is focusing on “strengthening and expanding” New Mexico’s early childhood system in 2026 as well as supporting career advancements and wage scales for people working in the field; and getting more families and community leaders involved in their efforts to support providers, families and children.
“Our state funding is strong, our partnerships are solid, and our commitment is unwavering,” Groginsky said. “ECECD will keep working to ensure every New Mexican family has access to the high-quality early care and education opportunities they want and deserve.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 14:11:43.084285

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) James Bruton grew up in rural Texas where the night skies were full of constellations. 
As he moved to larger cities, before ultimately settling in Des Moines, evening star gazing faded away for Bruton and could only be found with intentional trips away from the light-polluted metropolitans. 
Bruton hopes rural Iowa can keep that sense of wilderness, lower its electricity costs, help out local wildlife and even benefit from the growing astrotourism market, by enacting “dark sky” ordinances that limit light pollution. 
While the effort in Iowa is just getting off the ground, across the globe, nearly 200,000 square kilometers, or more than 77,000 square miles, are recognized as dark sky places by the international, volunteer organization, Dark Sky International. 
The open spaces of the west and national parks are the spots most people think of for prime stargazing, but Bruton said Iowa can develop its own dark sky areas and give people that same sense of wonder, but without a 10-hour drive. 
“Most of our days are spent looking at screens … being able to step away from that and truly just take in something as magnificent as a clear, dark night sky and everything that it beholds, it just creates (a) perspective that we don’t get when we live in so much light pollution,” Bruton said.

Dark sky doesn’t mean lack of visibility 
“It’s not about turning off the lights,” Bruton said. “It’s just about using light wisely so that communities can thrive.” 
A 2023 published study, analyzing citizen science observations, found that on average the night sky got brighter by 9.6% annually, from 2011 to 2022. 
According to the National Park Service the light pollution increase “exceed(s) the population growth rate” and has been caused by more light emitted per capita and more “uplight” or light that is directed or reflected upwards, emitted from fixtures. 
Dark Sky International recommends communities be more intentional with their outdoor lighting, in terms of brightness, direction, purpose and warmth. 
The organization has five principles for “responsible” lighting, which Bruton said would inform dark sky ordinances in a community. 
Dark Sky calls for lights that have a “clear purpose” and are only used when needed. 
It says light should also be “targeted” so that it doesn’t spill beyond where it is needed. Targeted lights could be something like street or parking lot lights that have a cover over the top to direct light down on the street and not up into the sky. 
The third principle is that lights should be “no brighter than necessary” with the idea that when something is excessively lit, it causes glare on surrounding surfaces and can be less effective than a dimmer light. 
An ordinance could specify, for example, that outdoor light fixtures not exceed 25% of guidelines set by the Illuminating Engineering Society, a technical and educational authority on lighting.
The fourth principle asks for controlled lights, those on a motion censor, timer or dimmer so that light is only used when it’s needed.  
These principles help to reduce energy costs by eliminating unnecessary lights.
The final principle calls for warm colored lights – below 3000 Kelvin –  because they are less disruptive to wildlife and don’t travel as far into the sky, according to Dark Sky International. 
A city could add an ordinance with guidelines on where cool colored lights are allowed, like in a public safety setting or a sports arena, to adhere to this principle. 
“An ordinance – it’s about protecting what we have,” Bruton said.
He said dark sky ordinances shouldn’t be prohibitive to new businesses or economic development and can actually make a community appear “more forward thinking.” 
Potential benefits of dark sky initiatives
Rural areas have fewer lights to manage, but they aren’t the only targets for dark sky initiatives. In fact, Flagstaff, Arizona, was the first city recognized as an “International Dark Sky Place” by the organization. In the past two decades, other urban areas like Breckenridge, Colorado, Moab, Utah and several suburbs of Chicago have earned dark sky designations of their own.
Recently, Thousand Hills State Park in Kirksville, Missouri, was named an Urban Night Sky Place, one of just 12 in the world. 
Listen for more about Thousand Hills’ journey to dark skies:
Bruton believes a dark sky designation could be a “boon” for rural Iowa towns. 
Modeling in a 2019 published study found that dark skies would generate additional $5.8 billion from non-local tourists that visited the Colorado plateau over a 10 year span. 
“We’re not Colorado, we don’t have the landscape, that they may have … but it’s still really beautiful here in Iowa,” Bruton said. “There aren’t (many) protected dark night skies in the Midwest, and I believe that we have the potential here in Iowa to help preserve our dark skies.” 
Astrotourism, or the cross of astronomy and tourism, relies on dark sky places. Bruton said this could make a small rural town a destination during an astrological event like an aurora borealis, meteor shower or eclipse. 
It is estimated that millions of people traveled to the path of totality in 2024 to view the total solar eclipse, AirBnb’s in the path were booked solid and an entire festivals cropped up for the astronomical event. While the eclipse was historic, Bruton said it seems like astrotourism is growing. 
Beyond a potential camera and telescope-wielding tourist market, Bruton said a dark sky can help to protect the “rural heritage” of a community and sense of community pride.
While some states and communities create their own Dark Sky nonprofits to advocate for reducing light pollution, Bruton said he hopes to partner with an existing wildlife or conservation nonprofit that is interested in the cause. 
“There’s no downside, there’s truly just a lack of awareness right now,” Bruton said. “I think that as people become more aware of this and recognize how easy it is and how simple it can be, that we can get people on board.”

Lauren Boebert gives a victory speech on the importance of uniting the Republican Party and ""taking back our country"" during a watch party at The Grainhouse in Windsor on June 25, 2024. (Andrew Fraieli for Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump vetoed a bill on Tuesday that would have given Colorado towns more time to pay back federal loans for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline project that will provide more clean water to southeastern Colorado.
The bill was sponsored by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd. Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper introduced a version in the Senate. It passed by a voice vote in the House of Representatives in July and passed unanimously in the Senate earlier this month.
“H.R. 131 would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it,” Trump wrote in his veto message.

Trump’s veto, the first of his second term, was roundly criticized by Colorado Democrats as another act of retaliation against the state for its ongoing incarceration of former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted on state charges related to breaking into the county’s voting machines to prove unfounded claims of widespread election fraud in 2020. The veto followed the administration’s announcement earlier this month that it would dismantle Boulder’s National Center for Atmospheric Research, and its denial of two disaster declaration requests that would have opened up federal funding to support wildfire and flood recovery in the state.
The 130-mile Arkansas Valley Conduit broke ground in 2023 and is set to eventually bring water from the Pueblo Reservoir to 50,000 Coloradans who live east of town. The bill would have extended the repayment period for local municipalities and removed interest payments.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it would have cost the federal government less than half a million dollars. In his veto message, Trump wrote that he was committed to ending the “massive cost of taxpayer handouts.”
In a social media post, Hurd said he was disappointed by the veto and argued that further delay of the project risks “stranding taxpayer dollars.”
“In southeastern Colorado, water infrastructure isn’t a luxury — it’s essential,” he wrote. “I will continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.”
Boebert also said she would continue advocating for the project in a statement to 9News, which first reported the veto.
“President Trump decided to veto a completely non-controversial, bipartisan bill that passed both the House and Senate unanimously,” Boebert said. “If this administration wants to make its legacy blocking projects that deliver water to rural Americans; that’s on them.”
In another statement on social media, Bennet categorized the veto as “payback because Colorado won’t bend to his corruption.” Trump earlier this year threatened “harsh measures” if the state didn’t move to release Peters, who is serving a nine-year prison sentence. Boebert also recently voted to release the Epstein files against Trump’s wishes.

Australia (Sydney): One of the first major cities to welcome the new year with a spectacular fireworks display over Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.
Italy: People wear red underwear for luck and love, eat lentils (symbolizing coins for prosperity), and sometimes throw furniture and old items out windows to let go of the past and make space for the new year.
Greece: On New Year’s morning, a pomegranate is smashed against the front door – the more seeds that scatter, the more abundance and good luck for the household in the coming year.

Spain’s 12 Grapes Tradition (courtesy indianexpress.com)

Spain: At midnight, people eat 12 grapes—one for each stroke of the clock—to bring good luck for each month of the coming year.
Scotland: Celebrations known as Hogmanay include street parties, bonfires, torchlight processions, and “first-footing”—being the first guest to enter a home after midnight, often bringing symbolic gifts like whiskey or shortbread for good luck.

Denmark: Revelers smash old plates against friends’ doors to ward off bad spirits and jump off chairs at midnight to “leap” into the new year.
Germany: Watching the classic British sketch “Dinner for One” on TV, eating pork for prosperity and enjoying fireworks.
Brazil: Many head to beaches (like Copacabana in Rio) dressed in white for peace, jump over seven waves while making wishes, and offer flowers to the sea goddess Yemanjá.

Ecuador: Effigies (año viejo) representing the old year are burned at midnight to symbolize letting go of the past and starting fresh.
Columbia: Many wear brand-new yellow underwear and run around the house with a suitcase to invite luck and travel.
Japan: Temples ring bells 108 times (Joya no Kane) to cleanse the sins of the past year; families eat long toshikoshi soba noodles for longevity and enjoy a quiet, reflective transition into the new year.
Philippines: Displaying and eating 12 round fruits for prosperity in each month, and people wear polka dots or make loud noises with fireworks to drive away evil spirits.
Russia: It’s customary to write a wish for the coming year, burn it, mix the ashes into champagne, and drink it before the clock strikes midnight. Families gather for a festive meal, watch the President’s speech and enjoy fireworks.  Ded Moroz (Grandfather Frost) delivers gifts, with major displays in places like Red Square in Moscow.
Puerto Rico: Before celebrations, they clean their homes and throw dirty water out of windows to rid themselves of negative energy.

These traditions blend fireworks, food symbolism, and rituals for luck, reflecting cultural hopes for prosperity, love, health, good fortune, and renewal.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NYC-Balldrop-Image.jpg,,,2025-12-31 12:57:45.498462

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed former University of Florida and Jacksonville Jaguars football coach Urban Meyer to the New College of Florida Board of Trustees.
The 61-year-old grew up in Ohio and made a name for himself in the Sunshine State, winning two national championships (2006 and 2008) with UF and more than 80% of the games he coached there, including 22 games in a row.
Lately, Meyer can be seen on TV as an analyst for FOX Sports.
He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame this year.
Meyer holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees and previously served as assistant athletic director at The Ohio State University, where he also won a national championship as a coach.
His less-than-a-year stint with the Jaguars was not as illustrious as his time in Gainesville. Meyer was fired before the end of the first season after winning two of the 13 games he coached for Jacksonville.
Meyer’s appointment was announced Tuesday, when DeSantis also reappointed Mark Bauerlein, editor of First Things Magazine, and Debra Jenks, an attorney, to the New College board. Jenks is a New College alum.
The appointments are subject to Florida Senate approval.
DeSantis is shaping New College into a more conservative institution, although the campus has also captured the eye of the Board of Governors for its spending habits. In 2023, DeSantis appointed six new members to the board. At the time, the United Faculty of Florida president called the new trustees “extremist ideologues.”
FAU
Also Tuesday, DeSantis reappointed chair Piero Bussani, an attorney, and Linda Stoch to the Florida Atlantic University Board of Trustees.
Thomas Mersch, an attorney, was newly appointed to the FAU board, too.

Christie Bassett, an education consultant and 2015 Florida teacher of the year; Jeffrey Beelaert, an attorney from Boise, Idaho, and former U.S. associate attorney general; and Jack Harrell, CEO of Harrel’s LLC and chair of the Florida Poly Foundation, rounded out the governor’s pre-New Year’s Eve appointments.

Gov. Maura Healey’s administration announced contract negotiations between the state’s electric utilities and two offshore wind developers have yet again been delayed due to upheaval in Washington. 
The negotiations had been set to wrap up by the end of the year after a deal wasn’t clinched six months ago but are now extended through June 2026 and appear likely to be frozen for most of if not all of President Trump’s term. 
The delay is just the latest to hit Massachusetts since the state selected three projects in September 2024. Vineyard Wind has started delivering power to the grid — the lone wind project in the state to do so — but other projects have not yet moved forward.  
That includes the two from this 2024 procurement — from developers Ocean Winds and Avangrid — after state regulators allowed offshore wind contracts to be terminated as hostile economic conditions roiled the industry. 
Avangrid and Ocean Winds didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
“Massachusetts remains committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, which includes offshore wind,” Lauren Diggin, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy Resources, said in a statement. “The uncertainty created by the changing federal landscape continues to be a challenge as the utilities and developers work to memorialize the bids in contracts.” 
The Republican trifecta in Washington has gutted federal support for offshore wind, halting already-approved projects and ending new federal leases. That has forced some Bay State officials to rethink Massachusetts’s ambitious clean energy goals and the timeline with which they can realistically be achieved. 
The Healey administration backed an effort to delay a statutory offshore wind procurement requirement of 5,600 megawatts from 2027 to 2029. And last month lawmakers considered weakening climate commitments to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels in response to cost concerns at home and disruption from Washington. 
Even before Trump retook office, though, offshore wind appeared on shaky footing despite a groundswell of support within the state. The developer for Vineyard Wind 2 withdrew the project, and tax incentives designed to spur an offshore wind manufacturing supply chain in Massachusetts have gone unclaimed for two straight years. 
How the state plans to increase energy supply to meet growing demand while meeting climate targets and addressing the affordability concerns sweeping the state is still an open question. Massachusetts will likely see an influx of hydropower starting early next year as the long-delayed New England Clean Energy Connect project bringing electricity from Quebec into the region is finalized. 
But with offshore wind stalled, Healey has turned to focus on expanding solar supply, thrown support behind nuclear and natural gas, and even explored importing wind from Canada — a complicated and likely expensive endeavor.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image0032-edited-3.webp?fit=642%2C482&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-31 12:13:20.221053

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in November a proposal to implement more exceptions for businesses to report the levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as forever chemicals.
“This data is necessary for EPA to evaluate and manage the risks associated with PFAS exposure and to prevent harm to human health and the environment,” the attorneys general representing 15 states wrote in a Dec. 22 comment letter. “EPA fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its sudden reversal and ignores the substantial body of reliable scientific research showing the importance of collecting this data.”
PFAS have been used in consumer products since the 1940s — including clothing, non-stick cookware, food packaging, car seats, and strollers.
The chemicals have been known to cause harms such as the increased risk of kidney, breast, pancreas, prostate, and testicular cancers as well as liver damage, high cholesterol and infertility.
“North Carolinians should be able to get straightforward information about how much and what kinds of PFAS are in the products we buy,” Jackson said in a Tuesday statement. “The EPA shouldn’t be helping companies hide what kinds of toxic chemicals they’re using. We know what PFAS damage looks like in North Carolina, and we need these companies to be more responsible.”
Jackson’s office has filed lawsuits against DuPont and Chemours, two chemical companies, for their role in PFAS contamination to natural resources and drinking water in the Cape Fear River Basin and its communities.
The EPA claims the proposed change would reduce duplicity and make reporting more straightforward for businesses.
“This Biden-era rule would have imposed crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1 billion in implementation costs on American businesses,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “Today’s proposal is grounded in commonsense and the law, allowing us to collect the information we need to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.

Homegrown comedy, The Conspiracists, blends satire, sibling drama, and First State talent in a rare Wilmington premiere
WILMINGTON — Delaware is not just the setting for the new independent comedy The Conspiracists — it is the backbone of the entire production.
Set to make its world premiere on January 8, 2026, at Wilmington’s historic Grand Opera House, The Conspiracists is one of the most Delaware-centric feature films released in years. The movie opens to U.S. audiences the following day, January 9.
Directed by Michael Perrie Jr., the 92-minute film blends sharp satire with character-driven comedy, using modern conspiracy culture as a jumping-off point for a story rooted in family, ambition, and unintended consequences.
The Plot: When Satire Gets Uncomfortably Real
At the center of The Conspiracists are two siblings determined to host an inclusive, welcoming conspiracy theory convention — a space meant to be humorous, open-minded, and community-focused.
Almost immediately, the plan begins to unravel.
As eccentric attendees arrive, egos clash, and logistics spiral out of control, one sibling becomes increasingly desperate to keep the convention alive. Meanwhile, the other stumbles upon something far more unsettling: a genuine conspiracy quietly unfolding behind the scenes of the very event meant to mock conspiracy culture.
The result is a fast-moving comedy that blurs the line between absurdity and reality, mixing sibling tension, cultural satire, and escalating chaos.
“It starts from a place that feels ridiculous,” said executive producer Christopher Bruce, “but then it asks the audience to look a little closer. The film isn’t about making fun of people — it’s about what happens when good intentions, fear, and ego collide.”
Bruce said the film’s emotional core was what drew him to the project.
“There’s a lot of comedy here, but there’s also something very human underneath it,” he said. “It’s about siblings trying to prove themselves, trying to be heard, and realizing they might be in over their heads.”
Delaware on Screen — As Itself
What truly sets The Conspiracists apart is how fully it embraces Delaware.
According to the production team, 12 of the film’s 13 shooting locations were in the First State. Rather than disguising Wilmington as another city, the film allows Delaware locations to play themselves on screen.  Featured locations include:


Hotel du Pont, which provides an elegant backdrop for key convention scenes


The Grand Opera House, which appears in the film and hosts the world premiere


Captain Blue Hen Comics


Siegel Jewish Community Center


Delaware Tire Center


Precious Paws


“We didn’t want Delaware to feel like a backdrop pretending to be somewhere else,” Bruce said. “Delaware is part of the story. You see it, you feel it, and if you know Wilmington, you’ll recognize it.”
Built by Delaware Talent
Behind the scenes, Delaware creatives were central to nearly every aspect of production.
The film was anchored at King Creative, the Wilmington-based studio that served as the operational hub for the project. Bruce, King Creative’s co-founder, served as executive producer and housed production operations at the studio’s Market Street location.
Working with an estimated $185,000 budget, the team relied heavily on local crews, Delaware film incentives, community partnerships, crowdfunding, and private investment.
“This movie was built here — by local talent, local crews, and local businesses,” Bruce said. “It proves that feature films don’t have to leave Delaware to get made.”
Delaware Faces on Screen
The ensemble cast includes Terrie Lynne, Christopher Murray, Carly Otte, Valarie Perez-Schere, Brian Ray, Noah Berry, Guy Wellman, and John Jezior — many of whom are familiar faces within Delaware’s independent film and theater communities.
Several cast members have appeared in previous Wilmington-shot projects and King Creative productions, reinforcing the film’s deep local roots.
A Rare Hometown Premiere
The red-carpet world premiere at the Grand Opera House marks a significant cultural moment for Wilmington. Feature films rarely debut in Delaware — and even fewer premiere in the same city where they were largely made.

“Premiering this movie in Wilmington isn’t just symbolic,” he said. “It’s the right way to thank the community that made it possible.”

With the latest round of certifications, the secretary of state’s office has now cleared nine initiative petitions to advance toward the 2026 statewide ballot, encompassing proposals to expand public access to records held by the Legislature and governor, restructure legislative stipends, allow collective bargaining for employees of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, and impose a new cap on annual state revenue growth with excess funds returned to taxpayers. Petitions needed to file 74,574 certified signatures this fall to proceed in the process.
The office certified 89,013 signatures for an initiative petition backed by Auditor Diana DiZoglio that would subject most records held by the Legislature and the governor’s office to the Massachusetts public records law. 
The office certified 96,797 signatures for an initiative petition seeking to overhaul the Legislature’s stipend system. The group backing the petition, the Legislative Effectiveness and Accountability Partnership, says legislative leadership use stipends to deliver $5 million to favored legislators, and calls the money “loyalty pay” intended to bind lawmakers to the wishes of leadership. Meanwhile, top Beacon Hill leaders say stipends reflect leadership responsibilities and allow lawmakers to think “about this job as a potential career.”
The ballot measure that would permit employees of the Committee for Public Counsel Services to collectively bargain had 86,153 signatures certified. The campaign backing the proposal is a partnership between SEIU and the National Association of Government Employees.
The office also certified 85,588 signatures for a ballot initiative that would change the limit on how much revenue the state can collect in a given year. The proposal would limit state revenue each year to the net amount of state revenue from the year before, increased by a rate equal to the average growth of wages and salaries in Massachusetts over the most recent three years, according to a summary from the Attorney General’s Office. If revenue collected by the state in a given year exceeds that limit, the excess amount would be refunded to taxpayers the following year.
There are two proposed ballot measures remaining that have yet to be certified: one that would steer sales tax revenue from sporting goods like golf clubs, RVs and camping gear into a new “Nature for All Fund” that could generate $100 million annually for water and nature conservation and restoration efforts; and another measure aimed at making it easier for residents to purchase a home by updating zoning rules.
The office has a January 7, 2026 deadline to process the remaining two proposed ballot measures and transmit them to the Legislature. After that deadline, the Legislature will have until May 5 to consider the proposals and act on them.
If the Legislature does not pass the measure as filed by then, a petitioner must then collect 12,429 more signatures and file them with local election officials for certification by June 17. After enough signatures are filed, the measure is then placed on the ballot for the 2026 statewide general election.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-01_all_party_primary_rally_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-31 11:14:25.310131

Laura Kelly against Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach.,"A dispute about the state's role in federal court litigation pits Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly against Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach. (Photos by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly and Attorney General Kris Kobach filed scorched-earth briefs outlining their disagreement on who possessed authority to advance federal litigation on behalf of the state of Kansas.
The ruckus headed to the Kansas Supreme Court was framed by Kelly and Kobach as a question of law involving interpretation of constitutional mandate and statutory power. Kobach and Kelly inflamed their feud by filing lawsuits against each other.
The turf war prompted a brief from the Kansas Legislative Coordinating Council, which is a committee of the Legislature’s top Republican and Democratic leaders, as well as one on behalf of Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab, state Treasurer Steven Johnson and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt.
This political clash between the Democratic governor and Republican attorney general is scheduled for oral argument before the state Supreme Court on Jan. 16.
Justin Whitten, chief counsel to Kelly, and Stephen McAllister, an attorney for the governor, said in a brief filed two days before Christmas that Kelly didn’t seek to control the attorney general, who the governor recognized held substantial common law power in Kansas. However, Kelly’s attorneys maintained the governor had authority as the state’s “supreme executive” to have her voice heard in federal litigation deemed to be in the interest of Kansans.
Whitten said Kansas court precedent affirmed the governor and the Legislature could direct the attorney general to join litigation, and the attorney general could refuse only if the request was unethical.
“She is not seeking to be the sole voice or the gatekeeper. She wants her voice, the voice which the Kansas Constitution bestows on her for the benefit of Kansas,” Whitten said. “She is not claiming the attorney general must always do her bidding, nor any other statewide elected official. They remain free to perform their duties as they see fit. But they cannot interfere with or prevent the governor from doing the same. Just because the attorney general stands down does not mean the governor lacks the authority to stand up for Kansas.”
Whitten said neither Kansas law nor history supported “the attorney general’s kingly gatekeeper theory.” If the attorney general prevailed, he said, Kobach’s sole control of the state’s litigation interests would result in unchecked power.
“The Kansas Constitution creates neither queens nor kings,” he said. “Quite the contrary, it purposely distributes power among numerous entities and officials.”
In the past, Kelly requested Kobach join multistate lawsuits challenging federal government actions, but the attorney general refused. Kelly was in favor of lawsuits against the administration of President Donald Trump related to federal funding of education, public health and food security.
Kelly sought to block disclosure to federal officials the personal information on Kansans who received aid under SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Whitten expressed frustration with Kobach’s claim that he alone should harness power to decide what federal lawsuits were worthy of the state’s backing. He noted Kobach had in the past attached Kansas to more than a dozen controversial lawsuits challenging President Joe Biden.
“The attorney general seeks to have his cake and eat it,” Whitten said. “He has exploited and touted his ability to bring and join partisan-motivated lawsuits to challenge federal laws he does not like. But when the governor seeks to join a challenge to federal laws that will harm tens of thousands of Kansans, he balks because the lawsuits are ‘meritless.’ ”
He said the attorney general’s attempt to reserve to himself the power to divine the state’s interests was a “guise for the attorney general to pursue his own partisan and political interests.”
 
Breathtaking theory
Kobach and Anthony Powell, who serves as the state solicitor general under Kobach, shared authorship of a brief declaring Kansas law granted the attorney general control of decisions to sue on behalf of the state in federal court.
Powell said Kelly’s role as governor was limited to asking the attorney general to appear on behalf of the state. Kansas statute couldn’t deliver to Kelly the “litigation authority she desperately wants,” he said.
“Governor Kelly brazenly asks this (state Supreme) Court to ignore the structure of the Kansas Constitution, the common law, 16 decades of Kansas history and this court’s many precedents to argue that she can control or supplant the attorney general in his exclusive legal representation of the state,” Powell said.
Powell said Kelly’s “breathtaking theory — that the governor somehow has ultimate control over any executive branch officer and their duties — is precisely the model of a unitary executive. Her theory is radical and wrong, both historically and legally.”
Powell said Kelly’s claim that supreme executive power entitled her to direct the attorney general to bring federal lawsuits ignored plain language of the state Constitution. Framers chose not to make the Kansas attorney general an appointed official subject to a governor’s direct control, he said.
“Their deliberate choice created independence and checks-and-balances within the executive branch,” Powell said. “The attorney general’s independent role in representing the state in litigation is a purposeful diffusion of authority that helps ensure electoral accountability.”
Powell said Kelly was asking the state Supreme Court to “obliterate that equilibrium based on her assertion that her election was effectively a coronation, giving her supremacy over any other executive branch officer.”
The potential of the governor and attorney general standing on opposing sides of a federal court case would provoke confusion, Powell said.
“If the governor can sue on behalf of the state, can the attorney general then appear and dismiss the case, or vice versa?” he said.
 
Other voices
In mid-December, attorneys Edward Greim and Matthew Mueller filed a legal brief with the state Supreme Court on behalf of the Legislative Coordinating Council.
“This case is no mere executive-branch turf war,” Greim said. “True, all that need be resolved is whether federal litigation on behalf of the state is ultimately controlled by the attorney general or governor — or by some awkward mix of both.”
He said state statute resolved the issue in favor of the Republican attorney general. Kelly’s argument was tied to her perspective of supreme executive power, he said, but acceptance of her theory would require reversal of decades of state court precedent.
For Kelly to prevail on the question of federal litigation, he said, the state Supreme Court would have to allow redistribution to the governor the Legislature’s power to engage in lawmaking.
“It would pull into the governor’s powerful embrace all law enforcement and litigation functions, necessarily including district attorneys and local prosecutions. It would apply, too, to the Legislature’s longstanding apportionment of executive powers among other constitutional officers. The governor would reign supreme,” Greim said.
Brant Laue, a Topeka attorney who prepared the brief submitted by the elected insurance commissioner, secretary of state and state treasurer, echoed arguments shared by the LCC and Kobach.
He said the state Constitution and Kansas law guaranteed an executive branch structure that was fractured among separately elected state officials.
“The governor of Kansas is not imbued with King-like executive powers over all matters they deem to be under their executive control,” he said. “The governor’s contrary arguments in this case must surely give pause to the state’s other executive officials: Will the governor’s next contention be that she can overrule the actions of the commissioner on matters of insurance or securities? Or perhaps she can supplant the role of the elected State Board of Education on matters of public education?”
“The answer to all of these alarming potential assertions of gubernatorial authority has to be a resounding “no,” but the governor’s positions in this case cast doubt on whether she would be so restrained in her assertion of power,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KellyKobach251230-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-31 11:14:25.310131

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A 79-year-old Iowa dentist with a long history of disciplinary action has agreed to surrender his license after being accused, for the third time, of stealing a patient’s prescription drugs.
In November, the Iowa Dental Board charged Robert Bruce Cochrane of Fort Dodge with unlawfully possessing or attempting to obtain controlled substances.
According to the board, Cochrane had scheduled a procedure on a patient and asked her to bring to the appointment the medications he had prescribed for her. “It was alleged that certain pills were not returned to the patient at the end of the appointment,” the board claims. “Upon the patient indicating that she was missing pills from her prescription, they were located by (Cochrane) and ultimately returned to the patient.”
The board has not publicly disclosed when or where the alleged actions took place.
As part of a recent settlement agreement with the board, Cochrane has admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to surrender his license.
Cochrane has a lengthy disciplinary history with the board dating back 30 years.
Board records indicate that in 1995, Cochrane admitted diverting controlled substances from his dental practice for his own daily use, in part by over-prescribing drugs for patients and then keeping some of their drugs for himself. At the time, the board also cited what it later called “evidence of substance abuse, including physical symptoms and mistakes when treating patients.”
The board ordered Cochrane to undergo a substance abuse evaluation, suspended his prescribing authority for controlled substances and placed his license on probation. A year later, in 1996, Cochrane entered into a consent order with the board in which he agreed to abstain from the use of all nonprescribed controlled substances.
In 1997, Cochrane allegedly tested positive for nonprescribed hydrocodone, after which he was charged by the board with failing to comply with the 1996 consent order. The charge was later dismissed after the board concluded there was a “strong possibility” the test results stemmed from a metabolite of the codeine Cochrane had been legitimately prescribed.
A few months later, in November 1998, the board expressed several concerns with Cochrane’s “overall management” of his substance abuse recovery. The board noted Cochrane had been prescribed opiates just one year after being diagnosed with opioid dependence by the Mayo Clinic and had also obtained a prescription for hydrocodone less than one year after entering substance-abuse treatment for use of that drug. Cochrane was ordered to select a new physician counselor to assist in his substance-abuse recovery.
After Cochrane challenged that action in court, the board reversed its decision and agreed to dismiss the order. In 2001, the board agreed to terminate Cochrane’s probation.
In 2003, the board charged Cochrane with the inability to practice dentistry with reasonable skill and safety by reason of habitual or excessive use of drugs, and willfully or repeatedly violating a board rule by failing to maintain records of controlled-substance prescriptions.
The board claimed that on at least two occasions, Cochrane issued prescriptions to patients prior to a surgery, then instructed the patients to bring the drugs to his office on the day of the surgery, then returned only a portion of the patients’ medications.
The board also alleged that in 2002, Cochrane had refused a board investigator’s request that he submit to chemical testing for drug use, then admitted he had a “problem” and indicated he was using medications not legally prescribed to him and was again using hydrocodone.
The board again placed Cochrane’s license on probation and ordered him to undergo additional substance abuse treatment. Over the next few years, the board scaled back the terms of that probationary order, first agreeing to reduce the order’s requirements for therapy, then agreeing to reduce the requirements for attendance at meetings of a 12-step program, and then agreeing to eliminate all requirements for group therapy.
In 2008, the board agreed to terminate Cochrane’s probation entirely.
As part of its recent order affirming Cochrane’s agreement to surrender his Iowa dental license, the board stipulated Cochrane will be eligible to seek reinstatement of his license in one year.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DENTAL-.jpg,,,2025-12-31 11:14:25.310131

(Photo illustration via Canva with book image by Getty Images)People made a terrible fuss when Dictionary.com named “6–7” its word of the year.
Brain rot, people said.
Language has gone to hell, others decried.
Our children are illiterate, still more wailed.
(My gripe is that “6–7” feels more like an idiom than a single word.)
But “6–7” does not bother me.
Words of the year are a cheap way for word-centered businesses to attract attention at the end of the year, when what remains of the news media struggles to fill websites and broadcasts.
The monotonous repetition of “6–7” by middle-school children is annoying but hardly alarming.
The “6–7” phenomenon is to language fads in the 2020s what “groovy” and “far out” were to the 1970s.
Everything was “totally awesome” and “gnarly” in the 1980s.
The Gen X war cry was “whatever” in the 1990s. Millennials said “literally” when they meant “figuratively,” and “low key” had nothing to do with a musical scale in the 2000s and 2010s.
No, I bear no grudge against “6–7.” In a world filled with nonsense, making something as meaningless as “6–7” into a generational slogan almost feels like sly self-satire.
What caught my attention was the amount of attention paid to Dictionary.com’s Word of the Year.
Word of the Year hype once belonged almost exclusively to Merriam-Webster and Oxford, the stalwarts of the printed age.
Oxford, first published in 1884, serves as the English — by which I mean British — dictionary of record for academics and legal professionals. It emphasizes how language is used and what that usage reveals about society. Oxford remains a global authority in scholarly linguistics.
Merriam-Webster represents the union of publishing magnates George and Charles Merriam with the work of Noah Webster, who published the first American dictionary in 1828.
The Merriam brothers acquired the rights to update Webster’s work, and their editions became the standard for American English for nearly two centuries.
Webster’s dictionaries are conservative and explanatory, built around clarity and correctness. “Webster’s New World College Dictionary” is the official dictionary of the Associated Press, one of the last reliable legacy news organizations.
Dictionary.com, however, was born in the digital age.
Early internet entrepreneurs Brian Kariger and Daniel Fierro co-founded Lexico Publishing in the mid-1990s. They wanted to move reference materials online, making them faster to search and easier to use.
They launched Dictionary.com, Thesaurus.com, and Reference.com in 1995.
Author W. Joseph Campbell describes 1995 as “the year the future began.” Microsoft released Internet Explorer. Netscape Navigator went public. Amazon and eBay launched. Sun Microsystems’ Java transformed web pages from static text into interactive platforms.
Newspapers, magazines, and television networks rushed online — and fatally mismanaged the digital transition.
Dictionary.com retained some traditions of print reference. It employed lexicographers. But its mission differed.
Merriam-Webster and Oxford document sustained usage over time. They value stability, evidence, and continuity. Words earn their place.
Dictionary.com emphasizes immediacy. It tracks search data, usage spikes, cultural relevance, and online language patterns. It adds slang quickly and updates definitions as meanings shift.
Defenders of traditional lexicography — including many former copy editors from now-defunct print publications — dismiss Dictionary.com the way they dismiss Wikipedia.
Popularity rules the internet, not research or methodology.
The thousands of stories mocking Dictionary.com’s selection of “6–7” miss the point.
It does not matter whether “6–7” is stupid. What matters is that legacy media and digital outlets alike amplified a story generated by Dictionary.com.
This is not about slang.
It is about who defines words and their meaning.
Oxford and Merriam-Webster also announced their own words of the year — “rage bait” and “slop,” respectively, but they haven’t received the same attention.
Dictionary.com’s focus on immediacy reflects a culture that values speed over context.
That bothers me.
The values of Merriam-Webster and Oxford — and perhaps the value of words themselves — trade poorly in a world where the dominant currency is not clarity, but likes and shares.
We do not need more once-essential institutions chasing engagement.
I can forgive children for experimenting with language. They are still learning who they are; new vernacular is part of that process.
Dictionaries — and the people who write them — should have a higher calling.

If its signature gathering effort proves successful, Ohio voters will be asked whether to reject provisions of Ohio Senate Bill 56 next November. They’ll need to collect almost 250,000 signatures to put that question on the ballot.
Ohio voters approved adult-use marijuana at the ballot box in November 2023. State lawmakers have been wrestling with changes to that law ever since.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Wesley Bryant, the owner of 420 Craft Beverages in Cleveland and one of the petitioners leading the referendum campaign, called lawmakers’ recent changes “a slap in the face to voters who overwhelmingly voted to legalize cannabis in 2023.”
What’s in the bill
Among S.B. 56’s changes, lawmakers capped marijuana potency, prohibited smoking in most public places, and imposed penalties on smoking in vehicles — as a driver or a passenger. Bringing legally purchased marijuana into Ohio from another stat would become illegal and Ohioans would face criminal penalties if they exceeded limits on homegrown cannabis. The new law also eliminates anti-discrimination provisions related to housing, employment and organ donation.
But perhaps the biggest change for Ohio’s marijuana industry is language banning intoxicating hemp outside of a licensed cannabis dispensary. Those products start from cannabis plants with very little naturally occurring THC and then alter other compounds in a laboratory setting to create more of the chemical that makes users feel high. The prohibition brings Ohio in line with recent changes to federal law.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signs intoxicating hemp ban, new marijuana regulations into law

 
Gov. Mike DeWine has been complaining for almost two years about the proliferation of intoxicating hemp products like gummies made to look like popular candy brands or other snacks. By signing S.B. 56 those products become illegal in March.
Notably, state lawmakers had thrown a lifeline to the state’s booming THC beverage industry. The bill that arrived on DeWine’s desk would’ve allowed beverages with up to 5 milligrams of THC to be produced and sold in Ohio until the end of 2026, when federal law kicks in and they become illegal. Instead, DeWine issued a line-item veto effectively prohibiting them in March along with other intoxicating hemp products.
The referendum
Ohioans for Cannabis Choice quickly announced plans for the referendum and filed its initial batch of signatures a little more than a week after DeWine signed the legislation.
“In filing our petitions today,” Bryant said in a statement, “We are taking a stand for Ohioans against politicians in Columbus and saying no to the government overreach of S.B. 56.”
With petitions delivered, state officials are on the clock. The Secretary of State has 10 business days to verify the signatures, and the Attorney General has the same amount of time to certify the petition summary is fair and truthful.
If the petition clears those bars, organizers can begin canvassing to collect signatures. They’ll need 6% of the total number of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election (248,092). The group will also need 3% of an individual county’s gubernatorial turnout in 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
Organizers will have 90 days from the date the governor filed the law with the secretary to collect the require signatures.
‘This bill is going to put …. me out of business.’ Ohioans in hemp industry fear potential new law

Another petitioner, Tuscarawas County hemp farmer Joseph Ellwood, said ordinary Ohioans weren’t asking for changes lawmakers made.
“Ohioans oppose re-criminalizing cannabis,” he said. “For example, making it a crime to grow more than six plants, a crime to have unauthorized paraphernalia, and a crime to buy marijuana in Michigan and bring it home.”
“And this is just the start,” Ellwood added. “Politicians in Columbus won’t stop until marijuana and hemp are completely illegal in Ohio again.”
Andrew Greene, the group’s third petitioner and an employee at a Dayton distribution center, said numerous jobs are at stake if S.B. 56 takes effect.
“There are thousands of workers like me who are going to lose their jobs because S.B. 56 will close more than 6,000 small businesses across Ohio,” Greene said.
“It’s sad because the cannabis industry, both hemp and marijuana, support legislation that will protect consumers and strengthen Ohio farmers and small businesses,” he went on, “But these out-of-touch politicians are hell bent on re-criminalizing marijuana and hemp products.”
Reactions
The measure’s sponsor, state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, expressed some sympathy for those frustrated with the bill, but portrayed several provisions as clarifications rather than wholesale changes. He pointed to the number of plants allowed for home growers as an example.
“We clarified the number of plants — six for one person, six for the other — that didn’t change,” he said of the 12-plant household limit. “But the way the ballot initiative was, you weren’t allowed to be prosecuted till 23 (plants) which really didn’t make sense, and 12 seemed to be what was intended, and we went with that.”
Lawmakers improved the expungement process, he added, and did work behind the scenes to hopefully streamline licensing and regulation for business owners.
And Huffman questioned the motives of those behind the referendum. Although Ohio voters approved adult-use marijuana, he said, much of the pushback against his bill seems to be coming from the hemp industry.
“The (2023) ballot initiative had absolutely zero effect on anything in the hemp industry,” Huffman said. “But it sounds like that’s the vast majority of what people want to overturn.”
“There’s some contradiction there,” he added.
DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney made a similar point. While he stressed it’s the right of any Ohio citizen to pursue a referendum, the organizers’ claim that S.B. 56 goes against the will of the voters is “inconsistent.”
The 2023 ballot measure could’ve allowed marijuana sales anywhere, Tierney said, but it didn’t. And so seeking a referendum to protect the sale of THC infused beverages in bars or convenience stores doesn’t protect the will of the voters.

Cowboys of Conservation
A series of articles exploring the relationship between cattle ranching and grassland conservation in Kansas. Grazing culture, from Indigenous tribes to the earliest settlers, was instrumental in both shaping and preserving the prairie ecosystems that define the state.
Part one: “The single greatest conservation threat” of our lifetime
Part two: Bill Sproul, the Flint Hills, and community-based conservation
Part three: Bill Barby, developing a culture of fire in the Red Hills
Part four: Out west, an exportable conservation model in Smoky Valley Ranch




“I had never seen this place look so brown and crispy,” said ranch manager Justin Roemer. “If you even looked at the grass, it just, poof, disintegrated.”
The region has always been dry, and it’s getting drier.
“Every rancher out here keeps precipitation logs like it’s their job, because everything they do depends on the water,” Roemer said.
Historical averages for the region are a scant 18-20 inches per year, but recent years, he said, have been averaging just 16.
“We plan for drought,” he said. “If we’re not prepared for that to happen, then that’s when it can either make us go bottom up, or we start going backwards on our habitat goals.”
Smoky Valley Ranch is owned by the Nature Conservancy, which purchased the property in 1999 and has added parcels over the years to bring its contiguous footprint to its current size. A remarkable 80% of the ranch is native, unplowed grassland, straddling the transition zone between mixed and shortgrass prairie. The ranch is home to lesser prairie chickens, pronghorn antelope, and black-footed ferrets, a critically endangered species once thought to be extinct. The Nature Conservancy provides custom grazing leases to cattle ranchers in the region.
Grazing leases are common in the cattle industry. Ranchers will rent a plot of land on which to raise their herds before sending them to market. Smoky Valley Ranch manages the herd for the ranchers, providing daily care, fencing, forage and water.
While other ranchers often manage their land to achieve their cattle production goals, Smoky Valley Ranch brings in cattle to support the prairie ecosystem.
“For us, the only purpose for our cattle on the ranch is to be our large grazer,” Roemer said. “They’re out there achieving our habitat goals. They are the ones that are manipulating the land.”

Grazing, fire and drought are the main drivers for land management, he said.
“Drought, which is the one that we can’t control, is probably the hardest, the best, the biggest driver of everything out here.”
It can be difficult to imagine eastern red cedar trees transforming the vast, treeless and arid landscapes of western Kansas, but Jesse Nippert, a distinguished professor of biology at Kansas State University who studies woody encroachment, said it’s only a matter of time.
“It might not be a problem now, but it will be a problem in the future,” Nippert said. “Woody plants have no problem growing out around Hoxie, Colby, Goodland, all those locations. They could not grow there 75 years ago, and they’re growing out there now passively.”
Increased atmospheric carbon, he said, is making the sturdy trees even more drought tolerant.
Eastern red cedar is the primary choice for shelterbelts, dense rows of trees strategically planted to shield against the harsh winds of the region. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which can introduce the species far from where it’s grown, Nippert said.
Ranchers and conservationists agree that the best way to prevent cedar encroachment is to keep native grasslands intact and burn on an appropriate schedule. For Smoky Valley Ranch, portions of the ranch are burned yearly. The entire ranch is burned on a 10-year schedule.
One of the biggest values of the work Roemer and the Nature Conservancy is doing, he said, is that it can be exported to other ranchers. The Nature Conservancy helps other ranchers develop grazing plans and hosts the Kansas Grazing Lands Coalition’s shortgrass range academy every year.
“We have to have those cattle on this ranch showing ‘this is what we’re doing with them, and here’s the results we’re getting. You can do this too,’ ” he said. “And I think that’s just so invaluable to have that opportunity.”
It is difficult to quantify exactly how much regenerative practices such as fire and rotational grazing are catching on. Management with prescribed fire has been increasing throughout the Great Plains, and Kansas now has 16 regional prescribed burn associations.

One metric that has seen rapid growth is a new labeling system, CARE certified, which lets beef consumers know the product they are purchasing was produced on ranches that practice regenerative grazing.
“CARE certified is a suite of standards,” said Lora Wright, director of sustainable animal proteins and technical services for Where Food Comes From, the company that audits producers who receive the label.
The four pillars of those standards are animal care, land stewardship, fair working conditions, and traceability. To receive the label, all facilities, from ranch to processing, must be vetted according to these standards, which were developed in collaboration with the Nature Conservancy.
Enrollment has grown almost 400% in less than five years — from 374 ranches and almost 315,000 cattle in 2020 to almost 1,300 ranches and more than a million head of cattle, on more than 42 million acres of rangeland, in 2024. Wright said she expects to see similar growth in the 2025 numbers, and that growth in Kansas has been strong.
“Producers in the state of Kansas are just as progressive as the others trying to preserve their lands,” Wright said. “With that is the biodiversity of wildlife and other things. Water is a big deal in western Kansas, and grazing management plans can help maintain all those natural resources.”
Where Food Comes From has partnered with retailers such as Walmart to get the products on shelves across the country. Consumers, Wright said, want to feel good about the beef they’re eating.
Conservation-minded ranchers, such as those profiled for this series, are working to  protect what native grasslands remain across the state. But the rapid advance of woody encroachment is compounding existing threats, such as urbanization and invasive species. And ranchers can’t manage for the increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide that is fueling woody plant growth, Nippert said.
Woody encroachment might seem inevitable, he said, but he sees reason to keep fighting back.
“This is our heritage, being a grassland state,” he said. “It’s our heritage as humans, akin to a location. And for that reason alone, I feel like I have an obligation to persist, to protect the places that we can protect, to find goals for recovery, for the places that we can recover, and then to find meaningful ecosystem services that we can derive out of the places that we likely can’t recover.”
Some places, he said, are never coming back.
But, he said, “We have an ethical responsibility to do what we can do, to push back.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Smoky-Valley-Ranch-Justin-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 09:58:25.381374

(File photo/Source NM)On Jan. 21, 2025, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez joined leaders in 17 other states and Washington, D.C., to challenge President Donald Trump’s executive order that sought to redefine birthright citizenship. Torrez in a statement called it a “direct attack on the Constitution and the fundamental rights it guarantees to every child born on American soil.”
In the nearly one year since then, Torrez’s New Mexico Department of Justice has led or signed onto 36 such cases in total. The legal challenges have taken aim at the administration’s cuts to SNAP funding, deployment of National Guard members and threats to withhold Victims of Crime Act grants from states that did not support federal immigration enforcement measures.
Torrez’s office in February took the lead in a multi-state lawsuit against Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, arguing that Trump “sought to elevate an agency, which was primarily responsible for the maintenance of government websites, into effectively a department of everything” and inappropriately appointed an agency head who wasn’t required to undergo Senate confirmation. 
Source NM spoke with Torrez about his year of suing the White House, the extent to which these claims have restored federal funding to programs in New Mexico and how he balances it with his “day job” as the top legal officer in the state. He expressed frustration with how DOGE cuts have become “internalized” across federal agencies, despite Musk’s departure. And he took aim at the U.S. Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Roberts, and its use of the emergency docket to weigh in on many of these issues.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: You’re ending this term as New Mexico attorney general. Did you imagine when you were elected in 2022 that you’d face another Trump Administration? 
Torrez: It was certainly not something that we had built a plan around, but we also didn’t foreclose the possibility that there would be a second term. Beginning in early 2024, as part of a national group of Democratic AGs, we started to plan pretty deliberately for what we considered to be the worst-case scenario — using Project 2025 as a blueprint for the second Trump administration.
We have kept our foot on the gas and participated — and even led — in the first action to name Elon Musk and DOGE in the early spring. That case was recently dismissed, in part because DOGE no longer exists. Unfortunately, some of the same destructive actions that were undertaken by Musk and the people that were reporting to him have been internalized into those agencies. It’s been formally disbanded, but the harm is very much alive.
One of the things that has also been a very big disappointment for me is the extent to which the Roberts court has been willing to intervene on the shadow docket even, and especially when, the coalition that we participated in has been successful at the lower court level, the district court level and even at the Court of Appeals. 
Do you see your role as holding the line against this Supreme Court?
My job is to fundamentally protect the people in this state.
You can look at this snapshot in time and look at the record that the Roberts court has had in dealing with this litigation and say, ‘Well, we’re not making a difference. We’re not making an impact.’ But if you widen the lens and you look at American history, whether it was desegregation, or the expansion of the federal government’s ability to protect working people in the Great Depression, the progressive movement in the early part of the 20th century, expanding civil rights for people in the ’50s and ’60s, women’s equality — a lot of times before there were victories in court and parallel victories in the legislative process, there were a lot of markers that were laid down by lawyers in those cases that didn’t win.
The arguments that they made and the stances that they took informed the judgments of subsequent courts. What is a dissent today from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson or from Justice Sotomayor may be the majority opinion of tomorrow.
What’s your criteria for joining these cases?
There is no binding framework about which cases we join or don’t join, but the starting point is whether or not I think it is of central importance to the people of this state.
Which cases do you see as having the most impact for New Mexico?
The obvious thing is executive orders that result in the withholding of critical funding for ongoing programs in our state.
Health care, after-school programs. New Mexico is a place that has the highest percentage of people enrolled in Medicaid in the country. It continues to have a school system that I believe is at the bottom, or near the bottom, of performance across the country. 
National Institutes of Health grant funding — I believe University of New Mexico had a number of grant programs for cancer research that were placed at risk. It’s an example of how ham-fisted and, frankly, stupid this administration has been. You give some DOGE bro the power to look at every contract and he just keyword searches a list of words that they’ve decided are no-go words and you end up eliminating a whole range of things.
Somehow the idea that diabetes impacts certain demographic groups more than others is “woke,” ergo we should cut that funding.
When you join one of these cases with a coalition of other attorneys general, what does that look like in practice? Are you just signing your name, is there a substantial burden to provide legal expertise? 
We were meeting on a daily basis for the first 90 or so days. All the elected principal AGs, not just staff. We have since taken that down to every other day.
We start tracking different federal policies that are going to negatively impact the states. Staff members will start drafting memos about how to coordinate litigation.
We go through a pretty extensive process within our own state executive agencies because we have to determine which federal programmatic dollars are going into which distributed programs in the state. And then we have to secure evidence and declarations from each of those executive branches. Then we also have participated in the drafting of substantive responses in each of those cases. 
That’s for one case.
You repeat that process 35 times. But the thing that is happening in Case 1 — that’s still a live case. So we have to track it. This judge in this case restored this line of funding — but has it been turned on? If we win the same ruling in, say, Case 22, but only on these two funding streams and not these three other funding streams, you can imagine it’s just this ever-growing resource challenge to track and monitor the pending status of all that litigation.
There’s about $12 billion in federal funding at stake across the 36 lawsuits. We’ve already restored, at least temporarily, tens of millions of dollars in programs in healthcare, education, the environment and the like.
And I still have my day job. I still have the CYFD investigation, the lawsuit in Western New Mexico University, the Crime Gun Intelligence Center initiative. We’re engaged in utility oversight and review.
You said $12 billion is at stake. In the cases we’ve discussed, you’re talking in terms of tens of millions of dollars that you’ve recovered. Is that discouraging?
No. A lot of those are stayed. Some of the funding is still flowing, but if we lose, it could be cut.
I think we’re going to know a lot more when we get to the merits of a lot of these cases. The sad part, though, is that some of these actions that were pursued by the administration through executive orders are now being built into the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” so even if we win on the restoration of funding from the first fiscal year, we’ll be overtaken by federal legislation.
None of the institutions in our government have been built to respond and react to the scale and speed of the destruction that’s being wrought by the Trump administration.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_3383-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 09:12:25.725965

(Photo courtesy of Visit Chester County, SC)COLUMBIA — When people visit Chester County, they often don’t realize everything it has to offer, said Keianna Benson, the local tourism director.
Benson hoped becoming part of the state’s Front Porch Program, a network of local welcome centers that get help from the state in promoting local attractions, will remedy that. In November, Chester County joined 41 other cities and counties in the 2-year-old program, which offers training and resources to every part of the state.
Located about halfway between Columbia and Charlotte, the county of 30,000 has two state parks, a skydiving center and plenty of local places to eat and shop, Benson said. The visitors’ center promotes all of those activities to anyone who stops by, whether they live out of town or locally, she said.
“I want us to be an all-inclusive tourist hub,” Benson said.
The idea is similar to that of the state’s nine major welcome centers, which offer brochures, maps and staff who can help plan an itinerary for any visit to the state, said Heather Harley, who oversees the program. Along with suggesting the state’s large cities, employees at the welcome centers often direct some of the 5 million visitors they see each year to what they consider undiscovered gems in smaller, less-traveled parts of the state.
“If we can get just a portion of that into these smaller towns, then we’ve done our jobs,” Harley said.
Having visitors’ centers in those locations, however, gives a local’s perspective the welcome centers can’t offer. The people running the local visitors’ centers typically know the area better than anyone, and they can help a visitor find more out-of-the-way destinations or curate a more specific plan, Harley said.
“We named it the Front Porch Program to emulate what we strive to be, which is that front porch of South Carolina, that happy smile, that welcoming, ‘Come on, have a seat, sit a spell’ feeling that you get when you visit somebody’s home,” Harley said.
For cities and counties, joining the Front Porch Program means easier access to resources and more promotion from the state Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, Harley said.
After applicants submit the $75 fee, a state-level staff member will tour what they have to offer, evaluating how many brochures advertise local activities, whether public bathrooms are available and the friendliness of staff.
If a location passes muster, the state agency will give it a plaque officially designating it the visitors’ center for the area and add it to the map of statewide spots to visit.
“Really, this is just more visibility,” Benson said.
The visitors’ center’s staff can join special training opportunities usually reserved for state agency employees, which can help them run the centers and come up with more ideas to drive tourism, Harley said.
For the smaller towns the program targets, such as Chester (with a population of about 5,300), more tourism can mean big economic benefits, Benson said. Making sure everyone who comes through has a good experience, including knowing where to go and meeting friendly people, they could become a repeat customer, Benson said.
“It’s very important for us to leave Chester in the back of their head as a place they want to visit another time,” Benson said.
The network of visitors’ centers in so many different places became an asset when Tropical Storm Helene struck in late September 2024, knocking out power for more than 1.2 million homes and businesses and killing 49 people in South Carolina.
Visitors’ centers that still had power turned into hubs where locals could charge their phones or come seeking non-emergency help, and the centers’ employees reached out to each other to ask for ways they could help, Harley said.
“The day-to-day things are amazing, but when you can really have that ability to lift each other up, I think that’s really when it changes how you feel about a program,” she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chester-county-2025-157-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 09:12:25.725965

Nancy Carpenter, America250 Mississippi’s development director, said that these celebrations are open to every American, regardless of their background or beliefs. 
“I know that right now everybody does not love each other, everybody does not get along, and my hope and prayer is that things can change and will change for the betterment of our state and our country,” she said.
The Mississippi Legislature established the America250 Mississippi Commission in 2023, and celebrations began in July of 2025. The commission is co-chaired by Elee Reeves, wife of Gov. Tate Reves; Lynn Hosemann, wife of Lt. Gov Delbert Hosemann; and Jolynn White, wife of House Speaker Jason White. The commission is working with state agencies such as Visit Mississippi, the Mississippi Arts Commission and the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.
There are local and national events and initiatives in celebration of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Mississippi has been part of past and ongoing national events, including America250’s Our American Story airstream, the Great American State Fair contest and Flag Sojourn 250. 
Sarah Campbell, director of the state’s Archives and History  programs and communication division, said there will be programming highlighting the state’s contributions to America, including its roles in Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement.

“When we talk about a nation founded on the principles of liberty and justice, Mississippi has been part of defining what that means, so that’s the part of the story that we’re telling,” Campbell said.
Mississippi began its America250 celebrations in July with a nationalization ceremony at the Two Mississippi Museums. An exhibit called “Mississippi Made,” which will showcase artifacts that tell of Mississippi’s contributions across various fields, will debut at the museums in 2026.
Archives and History also received a grant for the First Oval Office Project, to install a replica of George Washington’s tent from the Revolutionary War at the Old Capitol Museum. This project is in partnership with the Museum of the American Revolution.
Vendors and communities are encouraged to submit their events to be featured on the America250 Mississippi Commission’s website.
The America250 Mississippi Grant Program, funded by the Mississippi Legislature, gives communities the opportunity to join the festivities. The commission wants to ensure every corner of the state is included.
There are three types of grants depending on the scale of the project: mini grants, program grants and legacy grants. The Mississippi Humanities Council administers the grant program. 
Carol Andersen, assistant director of the Humanities Council, said the response to the request for proposals has been “robust.”
Andersen said, “They (grant proposals) have come from across the state. They have come from the tiniest organizations up to the largest non-profit entities functioning in our state.”
Information about requirements and deadlines is on the Mississippi Humanities Council’s website.
The Mississippi Arts Commission, as part of the celebration, also is offering a public art grant. 
Dr. Robert Luckett is a history professor and director of the Margaret Walker Center and Civil Rights Education Center at Jackson State University. The Margaret Walker Center is planning to commemorate the holiday with a 60th anniversary celebration of Margaret Walker’s novel “Jubilee.”  The historical novel tells the story of a biracial slave during the Civil War. Luckett also said the Margaret Walker Center is applying for an America250 program grant.
Luckett believes that it’s important to tell the full story of Mississippi’s history.
“We have stories to tell. We have powerful, wonderful stories to tell, to lift up, to celebrate, of people who risked and gave everything in the name of this nation and in the name of what has been built up over the last 250 years,” he said.
“And that is something we should be very proud of, but we also cannot tell those stories without talking about what they were up against.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/14103250/3X0A2676.jpg,,,2025-12-31 09:12:25.725965

Gavin Newsom’s year: LA fires, budget cuts, Trump battles and a Prop 50 win. What’s next for California’s governor in his final year?


It’s been a year of highs, lows and an ever-brighter national spotlight for Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
All eyes were on Los Angeles as wildfires tore through the city in January. Newsom, having just responded to President Donald Trump’s reelection by calling a special legislative session to fund lawsuits against him, was suddenly forced into a more conciliatory stance as he sought federal aid for fire recovery that has still not materialized. To close a tough budget deficit exacerbated by the prospect of steep federal cuts, he angered some in his own party with cuts to the state health coverage of undocumented immigrants. To explore Democrats’ losses in 2024, he alienated progressives while courting right-wing activists on his podcast. 
He found his way back as Trump resister-in-chief — and national Democratic darling — again when the president sent aggressive immigration raids and the National Guard to Los Angeles this summer. Then he successfully converted the anti-Trump fervor of that moment into a campaign for Proposition 50, the Democratic gerrymandering effort to counter the president’s attempt to gain new GOP seats in Congress. 
Newsom also won big with the Legislature along the way, using his considerable influence over the state budget to strong-arm lawmakers into passing significant carveouts to environmental law in an effort to boost construction of housing and infrastructure. He negotiated several major climate and energy policies that mostly ended up the way he wanted. Those efforts will allow Newsom to say to a national audience that he took voters’ concerns over affordability seriously and worked to lower housing and energy costs. But he will likely receive some blowback for backing away from a more aggressive and environmentally-minded stance toward the oil industry to achieve it — especially as he increasingly uses California’s strict emissions regulations and climate advocacy as a proxy for national leadership. 
But the mostly victorious year for the governor’s political profile has also been touched by scandal in recent weeks amid campaign corruption charges filed against his former top aide. He has not been accused of wrongdoing, but it’s possible the association could taint his reputation regardless as he looks for his next political move. 
2026 outlook:
The next year will continue to be challenging for the state budget as officials predict more deficits. That would limit the governor’s ability to propose any ambitious new programs in his final year in office, a time he’ll need to try to make more inroads on some of California’s most entrenched problems. A persistent housing shortage, homelessness and the high cost of living are all likely to become baggage for Newsom if he does pursue an expected presidential run after he leaves office.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/092424-Newsom-Bill-Signing-Fresno-LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-31 08:56:36.251745
,California,2025-12-31 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Scared of artificial intelligence? New law forces makers to disclose disaster plans,Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/12/new-ai-regulation/,Big Tech companies will have to disclose how they plan to prevent and handle artificial intelligence disasters.,"In summary
Big Tech companies will have to disclose how they plan to prevent and handle artificial intelligence disasters. 


Tech companies that create large, advanced artificial intelligence models will soon have to share more information about how the models can impact society and give their employees ways to warn the rest of us if things go wrong.
Starting January 1, a law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom gives whistleblower protections to employees at companies like Google and OpenAI whose work involves assessing the risk of critical safety incidents. It also requires large AI model developers to publish frameworks on their websites that include how the company responds to critical safety incidents and assesses and manages catastrophic risk. Fines for violating the frameworks can reach $1 million per violation. Under the law, companies must report critical safety incidents to the state within 15 days, or within 24 hours if they believe a risk poses an imminent threat of death or injury. 
The law began as Senate Bill 53, authored by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, to address catastrophic risk posed by advanced AI models, which are sometimes called frontier models. The law defines catastrophic risk as an instance where the tech can kill more than 50 people through a cyber attack or hurt people with a chemical, biological, radioactive, or nuclear weapon, or an instance where AI use results in more than $1 billion in theft or damage. It addresses the risks in the context of an operator losing control of an AI system, for example because the AI deceived them or took independent  action, situations that are largely considered hypothetical.
The law increases the information that AI makers must share with the public, including in a transparency report that must include the intended uses of a model, restrictions or conditions of using a model, how a company assesses and addresses catastrophic risk, and whether those efforts were reviewed by an independent third party.
The law will bring much-needed disclosure to the AI industry, said Rishi Bommasani, part of a Stanford University group that tracks transparency around AI. Only three of 13 companies his group recently studied regularly carry out incident reports and transparency scores his group issues to such companies fell on average over the last year, according to a newly issued report.
Bommasami is also a lead author of a report ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom that heavily influenced SB 53 and calls transparency a key to public trust in AI. He thinks the effectiveness of SB 53 depends heavily on the government agencies tasked with enforcing it and the resources they are allocated to do so.
“You can write whatever law in theory, but the practical impact of it is heavily shaped by how you implement it, how you enforce it, and how the company is engaged with it.”
The law was influential even before it went into effect. The governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, credited it as the basis for the AI transparency and safety law she signed Dec. 19. The similarity will grow, City & State New York reported, as the law will be “substantially rewritten next year largely to align with California’s language.”
Limitations and implementation
The new law falls short no matter how well it is enforced, critics say. It does not include in its definition of catastrophic risk issues like the impact of AI systems on the environment, their ability to spread disinformation, or their potential to perpetuate historical systems of oppression like sexism or racism. The law also does not apply to AI systems used by governments to profile people or assign them scores that can lead to a denial of government services or fraud accusations, and only targets companies that make $500 million in annual revenue.
Its transparency measures also stop short of full public visibility. In addition to providing the transparency reports, AI developers must also send incident reports to the Office of Emergency Services when things go wrong. Members of the public can also contact that office to report catastrophic risk incidents.
But the contents of incident reports submitted to OES by companies or their employees cannot be provided to the public via records requests and will be shared instead with members of the California Legislature and Newsom. Even then, they may be redacted to hide information that companies characterize as trade secrets, a common way companies prevent sharing information about their AI models.
Bommasami hopes additional transparency will be provided by Assembly Bill 2013, a bill that became law in 2024 and also takes effect Jan. 1. It requires companies to disclose additional details about the data they use to train AI models.
Some elements of SB 53 don’t kick in until next year. Starting in 2027, the Office of Emergency Services will produce a report about critical safety incidents the agency receives from the public and large frontier model makers.

How did we get here? Where do we go from here? Spend one minute to catch up on everything you need to know about California’s budget health this year.


Gov. Gavin Newsom opened this year with a rosy forecast: Buoyed by $17 billion more in revenue than previously planned, the state would have a modest surplus of $363 million for fiscal year 2025-26, he told reporters in January.
But life turns on a dime.
The January wildfires that ripped through Los Angeles forced the state to spend billions in disaster aid and delay tax filings for LA residents. The cost of Medi-Cal, the state-run health insurance program for low-income residents, ballooned to $6 billion more than anticipated. President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again tariff policies rocked the stock market, which California heavily relies on for tax revenue. And the state lodged a flurry of lawsuits against the Trump administration over its threat to withhold federal funding for food assistance, disaster recovery and other grants.
By May, Newsom no longer predicted a modest surplus, but a $12 billion deficit. 
To plug the hole, Newsom initially proposed drastic cuts to Medi-Cal. But the final budget he negotiated with state lawmakers depended largely on internal borrowing, dipping into the state’s reserves and freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants to avoid deep cuts to other social services.
While Democratic leaders largely blamed the Trump administration for California’s budget problem, the volatility of state revenues is not new. California highly depends on taxing the income and capital gains of high earners, whose fortune is often at the mercy of the stock market. In 2022, the state saw a nearly $100 billion surplus, followed by a projected $56 billion deficit over the next two years.
2026 outlook
The deficit is projected to reach nearly $18 billion next year, mostly because the state is expected to spend so much money that it would offset, if not eclipse, the strong tax revenues driven by an AI boom, said the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office in its fiscal outlook last month.
If the estimate holds, it’ll be the fourth year in a row in Newsom’s tenure that California faces a deficit despite revenue growth.
Worse yet, the structural deficit could reach $35 billion annually by fiscal year 2027-28, the LAO said. 
California is facing $6 billion in extra spending next year, including at least $1.3 billion because the state must now pay more to cover Medi-Cal benefits under Trump’s budget bill. The state also stands to lose more housing and homelessness funding from the federal government.
How can legislators fix it? The options are stretching thin, as the state already took one-time measures to balance the books. The LAO notes that solving an ongoing structural budget problem requires either finding more sustainable revenue streams, or making serious cuts, or both.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-31 08:56:36.251745

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Civil rights groups have filed public information requests on agreements between local Alabama law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on enforcing immigration laws.
In November, the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice; the Hispanic and Immigrant Center of Alabama and the Center for Constitutional Rights, civil rights and immigration advocacy groups with offices in Alabama, filed public information requests to review agreements and payments between ICE and the Baldwin and Pickens sheriffs’ offices and the Leeds Police Department.
“We picked places where we knew there was new activity or increased activity, and where there were a lot of question marks,” said C.J. Sandley, senior staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “There were some high-profile incidents that covered different areas of the state.”

The Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office said that they were in process of having the request reviewed by the attorney.
“The majority of the request is going to be overly broad based on our statutes here,” said Maj. Tony Nolfe of the Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office. “A lot of it as well would be the responsibility of our partner agencies, like the federal government as opposed to us. It is in the process.”
Messages were left with other agencies seeking comment.
The requests are seeking documents that are related to any of the agreements between the federal agencies such as ICE related to the 287(g) program that authorizes the sheriffs and police departments to enforce the nation’s immigration laws on behalf of the federal government.
The records requests are also seeking payments between the local law enforcement agencies and ICE; Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Marshal Service. Groups also want information about ICE accompanying local law enforcement as they perform their duties.
The records request to the Leeds Police Department sought communication regarding traffic stops, investigations and detentions on Aug. 5,the day that an officer for the Leeds Police Department pulled over Giovanna Hernandez Martinez for allegedly speeding.
The officer asked for her driver’s license, but Martinez produced an identification card that was issued in Mexico. The Leeds Police Department then reached out to immigration agents and had Martinez taken into custody and taken into the Pickens’ County Jail before getting transferred to the custody of ICE. After weeks in custody, where her family said she lacked access to health care, Martinez went to Mexico, a place she had not been since she was seven years old.
The groups also requested communications between the Leeds Police Department and the federal government pertaining to another unnamed incident on Oct. 28.
The groups are also seeking information regarding individuals who were detained at the Pickens County Jail who were in custody of ICE dating back to Nov. 5.
Groups are asking the Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office for records that deal with law enforcement activity over immigration raids that took place at different construction sites on May 21 and June 12, along with the same information that was requested from the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office.
Based on the timeline, the requests for information relate to Leonardo Garcia Venegas, an American citizen who was born in Florida and moved to Alabama, who was placed in ICE detention twice after immigration agents raided construction sites.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250810_152354-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-31 08:11:44.371949

Howell resident Jeff Amayo, who is Black, confronted white supremacists waving Nazi flags during a Feb. 6 anti-racist event outside a local theater. Yet he was accused by Howell city officials of having “antagonized, challenged and taunted” the protestors, with his actions equated to those of the white supremacists themselves. Amayo later filed a complaint with the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, naming both the city and its police department.

The Detroit Regional Chamber’s annual Mackinac Policy Conference, held in late May, is a controversial fixture of Michigan politics in which elected Democrats and Republicans temporarily call a truce (more or less) to political antagonism and glad hand with lobbyists, business representatives and community leaders for three days of networking and panel discussions. However, the conference has drawn criticism from activist groups who have raised concerns about the influence of corporate money in politics.

Under Speaker Matt Hall’s leadership, the Michigan House budget process in 2025 was marked by partisan gridlock, internal GOP turmoil, and controversial tactics that prolonged negotiations and frustrated lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Hall’s decision to publicly oust state Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) as the minority vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee — blaming him for stalled budget talks — was widely seen as political theater rather than effective budget leadership, with critics arguing it reflected deep dysfunction.

“We are standing here today to stand up to the Trump Administration to tell them, ‘Get this coal plant shut down.’” That was the message that lawmakers, health professionals and other officials said at an Aug. 12 press conference near the J.H. Campbell coal plant in West Michigan’s Ottawa County, which has become the epicenter of a legal battle between the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. The group believed the Trump Administration created an “energy emergency” to justify issuing an emergency order May 23 mandating that Consumers Energy keep the plant open at least 90 days, which superseded the utility’s closure plan slated for May 31, along with the approval of closure by state regulators.

At least one hundred demonstrators, carrying signs and waving transgender flags, were there among students and community members who gathered Sept. 12 outside the University of Michigan hospital in Ann Arbor, angered by the institution’s decision to deny gender affirming care due for transgender youth following the U.S. Department of Justice issuing subpoenas for information about doctors “involved in performing transgender medical procedures on children.” It was just the latest salvo in trans bigotry perpetrated by the Trump administration.

While it passed the Senate by a slim 19-17 vote, it had nearly as much bipartisan dissent as it did support, an apt metaphor for the entire budget process that included a brief government shutdown.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), in protest of the expected lapse in SNAP benefits as a result of the Republican-sponsored “One Big Beautiful Bill”, Barrett released a statement claiming his “congressional office in Lansing was vandalized by a group of trespassers during a political rally of left-wing activists.” The reaction was panned by critics as an overreaction to legitimate protest of a lawmaker who consistently declined to hold in-person constituent town halls.

Fifty years after the sinking of the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald, the 729-foot freighter that sank on Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975 on its way from Wisconsin to Detroit, memorials around Michigan and the Great Lakes paid homage to the 29 lives lost on the ship. The premiere event was at the Mariners’ Church of Detroit, where the church’s Octorara and Brotherhood Bells tolled 30 times — 29 for each member of the crew who died, and one final toll for all sailors who have died on the Great Lakes.

A year ago, in our look back on 2024, I made no note of a series of stories I’d written about Project 2025, a right-wing manifesto for the next conservative president, authored by a variety of loyalists to Donald J. Trump, who was campaigning at the time for a second term. 
The plan, which called for outlandish acts, such as ending the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S., seemed unlikely to gain traction, and Trump repeatedly claimed ignorance of its directives. 
Yet hours into his second term, with the stroke of his Sharpie, Trump eliminated birthright citizenship and centuries of American tradition, in the first of a cavalcade of nativist policies. 
Wrapping up the first week of his second term, and fresh from pardoning roughly 1,500 January 6 rioters, Trump took a victory lap in Las Vegas, where he praised Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo for propelling him to a win in Nevada. Lombardo, a former sheriff, had no response to Trump’s pardons. 
The governor, who faces re-election in 2026, maintained his silence on Trump’s agenda for much of the year and characterized Nevadans’ protests of programs gutted by Trump as “shameless political theater.” 
Lombardo failed to object when Trump cut federally funded initiatives designed to benefit Nevadans. When Trump’s administration included Nevada on a list of sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants, the governor’s swift action to comply with the administration’s demands resulted in Nevada being the first state to be removed from the list. 
Trump’s professed affinity for Nevada is often belied by his agenda. 
Visitation to Nevada has tumbled as Trump’s tariffs have kept travelers home, and the president’s promise to tweak deportation policies that harm the hospitality industry never materialized. Adding insult to injury, the Trump family has invested with gambling interests that are at odds with Nevada casinos.  
Trump’s armor, shielded so far by the Supreme Court and a compliant Congress, has seemed impenetrable. Now, with nothing less than the fate of democracy in the balance, chinks are appearing as Americans question the president’s failure to deliver on the economy, and the Republican Party splinters over antisemitism and the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Studies have found that parents report lower day-to-day happiness but higher overall life satisfaction than nonparents. The common interpretation is that raising children is often a profound source of joy that can define a person, but that it’s really really exhausting on the micro level, especially when you lack communal and societal support systems.
I’ve been thinking about this paradox not just because I have three young kids and just survived the chaos of Christmas but because I see a parallel with my work here at the Current. I spend a whole lot of time watching soul-sucking public meetings. This year especially I probably spent even more time just waiting for legislative meetings to convene. I have gone through hundreds of pages of drab reports and data. I have stress-eaten pounds of sweets while trying to understand topics well enough to translate them for a broader audience who doesn’t have the luxury to spend hours, weeks or months researching a topic.
It is time-consuming and often frustrating work. If my kids participated in “bring your kid to work day” they would die of boredom as they watched me write public records requests on one laptop while a second laptop plays a legislative hearing on 2x speed. They’d yearn for their own common core math lessons while watching me learn about Nevada’s Basic City/County Relief Tax (BCCRT) and Supplemental City-County Relief Tax (SCCRT).
But if I look at the broader picture: It’s such satisfying work.
The example of the year is — of course — the Summerlin film studio proposal. Over the past 12 months I wrote thousands and thousands of words on the state’s transferable tax credits and a proposal to expand it by abajillionmilliondollars. I explained the math behind ‘qualified expenses,’ showed how the project could devastate the state budget, and shined a spotlight on the real estate component that most overlooked. It was reporting I hope shaped the conversation as it unfolded in Carson City, but if nothing else it explains why the project was rejected by state lawmakers twice this year.
Also warranting closer scrutiny this year was Campus for Hope, which lawmakers have touted as the embodiment of public-private partnership. I reported early this year that 92% of ongoing operational costs at the “transformational campus” will be footed by taxpayers, while the board overseeing the campus will be composed of only resort industry reps.
(Y’know, maybe that does embody the spirit of most public-private partnerships.)
Other topics I explored this year are ones that will likely come up again in 2026 or 2027: A proposal to make Nevada the premier destination for corporate litigation, a potentially palatable property tax adjustment, and the push against corporate homeownership.
Speaking of owning your own home: Early this year I used available public records to determine that at least 90% of state lawmakers are homeowners and that more than half own additional real estate. It’s something housing advocates say contributes to the difficulty of passing protections for renters.
And, to end on a lighter note, 2025 will also be remembered as the year Boulder City residents fought back against Pinkbox Doughnuts and their “10-foot tall, 11-foot wide, 6-foot deep turds.”

Happy Holidays, readers! I’ll have to start this year-in-review with a report that Fall 2025 ranked as the third warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
A large atmospheric storm passed over Las Vegas on Christmas Eve, and five years ago that would have meant a white Christmas. But with December temperatures nearly 7 degrees warmer than average this year – and nowhere near freezing – we had to be content with some rain.
Global fossil fuel emissions are also on track to soar to record highs in 2025, according to data from the Global Carbon Project. While emissions stayed nearly flat in Europe and China, they rose significantly in the United States.
Human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel emissions responsible are not slowing down, so on to mitigation, I guess. But unlike emissions, climate change mitigation has not increased in the United States.
The Walker River Paiute Tribe, a rural frontline community feeling the impacts of climate change, was going to use a $20 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency this year to upgrade about 30% of all homes on their reservation for climate resiliency. 
But the Trump administration terminated the funding as part of the president’s executive order to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) across the government. I’m grateful leaders from the Walker River Paiute Tribe talked to me about it, because I think it’s important to understand what was lost.
More funding was ripped away from Nevada communities that were eager to build economic and local agricultural resiliency under a quickly changing climate.
In March, two programs that provided Nevada schools and food banks food from local farms and ranchers lost $8 million in funding when the Trump administration pulled it in an effort to slash government spending and remake the federal government. The Trump administration also halted the delivery of more than a million pounds of meat, eggs and dairy to food banks in Nevada a week later.
Other programs that supported Nevada’s food system were axed. In August the Trump administration cut $3 million in federal funding for a program that supported the growth of local small and mid-sized food and farm businesses in Nevada.
It was a difficult year for the Nevadans that worked hard to get those grants for the benefit of the state and its communities. Again, I’m grateful to everyone who shared their stories with me, because again, I think it’s important to understand what was lost.
Still, I hope the end of year holidays are far better to Nevadans than Valentine’s Day and Presidents’ Day weekend, when the Trump administration fired thousands of federal employees with little explanation or warning, including Nevada’s veterans and National Park Service workers. Here are some of their stories. 
Thank you for reading them.

Even after years of reporting on homelessness and housing stability, I still find more to learn about the way the lack of housing intersects with other policies and social service systems. 
I was honored this year to be selected as a national fellow with USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism, which gave me an opportunity to dig into how inadequate housing intersects with the child welfare system. Through the reporting process, I quickly discovered that while housing does play a role on the front end, often compounded with other issues such as mental health, the lack of a stable and secure living environment also becomes a huge barrier on the back end when parents are seeking to reunify with their children. 
In my first story, I was able to dive into some of the available data on the number of times homelessness or inadequate housing appears when a child is removed from their parents. My third story talked about referrals into the system. I didn’t just want to write this series and not report on solutions to a problem. My second story was about an approach to use motels, like a former La Quinta, as non-congregate shelters to house families at risk of homelessness and prevent involvement in the child welfare system.
This year has been rough for a lot of people. Since the start of the second Trump Administration, there has been a hyperfocus on rolling back protections and targeting various communities. As a result, transgender and gender-nonconforming people have faced increased attacks — this comes after a stark rise in anti-trans rhetoric and legislation nationwide in recent years. Here at Nevada Current, we take pride in not “bothsidesing” certain issues, including human rights. It is my honor to be able to tell the stories of trans people in our community and what these attacks have meant.

One of the eleventy-nine orders Trump issued on the day he was inaugurated was named “Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis.” I’d forgotten about it. Recent polling suggests people struggling to make ends meet assume he has too. But I was reminded of it while looking over my columns this year and seeing that I referenced it in a commentary. As the year began, I noted in the piece, not only had Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo and Trump both promised to address the cost of living. They both also indicated, if unintentionally, that between the two of them they couldn’t clearly explain how they’d do it. Swap the reference to eggs with groceries, utilities, housing, eating out, and other costs, and that column holds up pretty well. Sadly.
Also in January 2025, I was already looking ahead to 2026, by looking backward. In 2026, you see, no U.S. Senate seat will be on the ballot in Nevada and it isn’t a presidential election year, so the only thing approximating a high-profile race is the one for governor. It’s a quirk of Nevada’s election calendar that happens every twelve years. The last time it happened, in 2014, and the time before that in 2002, the much vaunted supercalifragilistic Reid Machine, aka the Nevada Democrats, knowingly and willingly ceded the governor’s race to a Republican incumbent by not putting up a fight. Surely they won’t do that in 2026, I suggested in January 2025. That column also holds up pretty well. But then, columns based mostly on history might have an advantage on that score.
This year I wrote several columns about the never-to-be-underestimated capacity of Nevada Democrats in Congress to disappoint a base that entered the year already very disappointed with them. Themes in the genre included (but were not limited to) Nevada congressional Democrats’ curious impulse to sanewash and  normalize Trump, and their peculiar passivity toward and assistance to the cryptocurrency industry. 
State-level Democrats, sometimes in tandem with their Republican governor, garnered attention for ignoring derelict state policy that harms Nevada households, while perpetually insisting the best way to improve household financial stability is to give public money to big business. When it comes to a majority of Nevada elected officials’ bipartisan hidebound resistance to reforming industry-friendly but people-hostile economic and tax policies, 2025 was the same as every year.
But in many other respects 2025 was a godforsaken atrocity of a year, a year, to borrow a signature verbal tic of Trump 2.0, “like nobody’s seen before.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s hourly minimum wage will rise to $15.92 after the latest automatic inflation adjustment occurs with the start of the new year Thursday.
The 2026 increase raises New Jersey’s minimum wage by 43 cents per hour for most classes of workers. That exceeds the 36-cent increase that went into effect at the start of 2025.
Minimum wages for some workers will lag behind that figure. State law requires seasonal employees and those working for employers with fewer than six workers to be paid at least $15.23, up from $14.53 in 2025.
The wage floor for those workers will continue to rise through 2028, at which point their minimum wage will equal the one applied to most workers.
Farm workers will see a longer phase-in. Their wage floor, which will rise 80 cents to $14.20 on Thursday, is not set to equal the one for most workers until 2030.
Tipped workers’ minimum wage will rise to $6.05 an hour, though employers must match the $15.92 minimum wage if a tipped worker’s income would fall below that level with gratuities included.
New Jersey’s wage floor is among the highest in the nation. Washington ($16.66), California ($16.50), and Connecticut ($16.35) are the only states with a higher statewide minimum wage, though minimum wages are higher in some parts of New York and Oregon.

In 2025, CalMatters’ and The Markup’s reporting prompted lawmakers to introduce eight new bills, agencies to take action, companies to change their practices and constituents to contact their representatives.


In 2025, Californians used CalMatters’ and The Markup’s journalism to spark measurable change in the state and across the country.
State and federal lawmakers introduced eight new bills addressing issues ranging from government corruption to patient health insurance protections and wage theft. 
At least seven state or federal agencies took action, including actions to suspend or revoke licenses for drivers convicted of killing someone with their vehicle, fine a former lawmaker for violating campaign finance law and restore a $36 million grant to study dementia.
Multiple companies changed their practices. For example, more than 10 companies stopped hiding their data opt-out instructions from Google search.
Just as importantly, our journalism touched Californians on a personal level — reuniting families, prompting constituents to reach out to their legislators and helping voters make informed decisions.
CalMatters is a member-supported nonprofit newsroom, and we believe that independent journalism is critical to keeping our government transparent and our leaders accountable. We also believe that at its best, our reporting equips Californians — whether they’re community members, businesses, nonprofits, regulators or lawmakers — with the information they need to make critical decisions.
These beliefs drive our work year after year. And as journalists, we’re proud that this year, our reporting made a measurable and meaningful difference for people across California and beyond. 
This year, CalMatters’ and The Markup’s reporting led to:

Nearly 200 drivers, who had all been convicted of killing someone with their vehicle, having their driving privileges suspended or revoked.
California’s elected and appointed officials being required by law to tell the public when they’ve accepted a job offer from a new employer that might seek favors from them while they’re still in a position of power.
Rural California getting a lifeline in school funding as Congress restores money it cut.
Birthing centers getting help from a new law that tries to make staying open in rural and low-income areas easier, at a time when, after dozens of closures, vast areas of California have no hospitals or birth centers.
State lawmakers calling for:

increased oversight of California’s billion-dollar shelter system, 
solutions to address when employers are stealing wages from workers and 
increased protections for patients’ health insurance eligibility during the first 28 days of treatment.


Los Angeles County pushing to restrict sharing and retention of license plate data collected with high-tech surveillance cameras.
State-run health exchange websites in California, Nevada and Massachusetts ending their practice of sending visitors’ sensitive data – like what medications they take and whether they’re pregnant or disabled — to big tech companies.
California’s Republican congressional representatives calling for an investigation after scammers stole more than $10 million in federal financial aid from California’s community colleges.
Families reuniting with their homeless loved ones.
Multiple companies stopping their practice of hiding data opt-out instructions from Google search results.
Los Angeles officials turning over secret homeless shelter complaints.
Fremont removing a controversial clause from their city ordinance that could have punished those “aiding and abetting” homeless encampments.
Constituents directly asking their legislators to explain their votes on a bill.
Individual lawmakers bucking protocol and voting against their colleagues’ bills, even though lawmakers almost never vote “no” in the California Capitol. 
A civil lawsuit against Match Group, the world’s largest dating app company, arguing that its dating apps could kick off serial rapists but don’t.
California Highway Patrol planning to equip all 7,600 officers with body cameras by 2026, when three years ago, only 3% of officers wore body cams.
The National Institutes of Health reversing its termination of a $36 million grant to a UC Davis researcher studying dementia.
California’s political watchdog fining a former lawmaker $106,000 for violating campaign finance laws.
Federal lawmakers calling for outlawing loopholes that let insurance companies charge more in Black neighborhoods.
A federal judge issuing a temporary restraining order in July to halt warrantless immigration stops throughout a wide swath of California. The Supreme Court lifted the temporary restraining order in September.
The Department of Homeland Security telling a federal court it will retrain more than 900 California-based Border Patrol agents on how to comply with the Constitution, following controversial immigration sweeps in Kern County in January.
ICE releasing a deaf Mongolian immigrant after holding him for months without an interpreter.
A nonprofit improving their early childhood mental health practices after learning more about how a San Diego preschool helps students who have experienced family trauma.

There are even more examples than what we’ve shared, such as when we hear from government agencies that our data helped them better understand a topic, or when companies tell us they’re going to make changes that take time to happen.
How readers used our reporting
As we close out 2025, I want to highlight another kind of impact that we’re incredibly proud of: When our journalism helps people make an informed decision or take action that’s meaningful to them. In our 2025 audience survey, 89% of readers said they’ve voted in local, state or national elections for 10 or more years. After reading a CalMatters article, more than 80% felt better informed and more than 20% have been inspired to write to a state official.
Here are a few examples of what readers have told us this year:

From Cecilia, in Sacramento: “[CalMatters] helps me get the facts I need to assess my own political beliefs and the effectiveness of my preferred policies. Your explanations of ballot measures are also the best I have encountered. They’re excellent at distilling complicated subjects for all audiences.”
From Omer, in Los Angeles: “I work in government and CalMatters’ deep coverage is so vital. I’ve used articles to research and justify policy action, so I feel indebted.”
From Carol, in Morro Bay: “The License to Kill series, among many others, really blew my mind. I have written my elected officials several times each. I will not forget the negligence of not having a consequential action for these wrongful deaths.”
From David, in Oceanside: “In a democracy, news becomes valuable when the electorate can inform their representatives about needed and proposed legislation. CalMatters’ My Legislators newsletter gives me that information, and it’s already helped me in a short window of time [to] contact my representatives on a variety of topics. CalMatters is bucking a dangerous trend by providing this valuable information.”

We only have the privilege of knowing about impact like this when you, our readers, tell us about it. This kind of impact is also one of the day-to-day reasons why we do this work. If our journalism has helped you, I’d love to hear about it.

Public service is measured by outcomes and community impact.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  K. Thomas Randall: Vermont’s public workforce didn’t disappear. It dispersed..","Dear Editor,



Dan Jones’ column, “Whatever happened to public service?”, draws the wrong conclusion from the state’s return-to-office dispute. It frames remote work as a loss of civic commitment when the facts suggest something very different.
Remote employees living out of state are the exception, not the rule. According to data from the Vermont Department of Human Resources, the state workforce is now distributed more broadly across all fourteen counties than it was prior to the pandemic when employment was heavily concentrated in Washington and Chittenden counties. That shift hasn’t weakened public service; it has spread it.

Those employees may not be spending money in Montpelier or Waterbury, but they are spending it in Hardwick, Brattleboro, Rutland and dozens of other communities. The local commitment Jones suggests is missing hasn’t vanished; it has been redistributed. Public sector employees are also more likely than the general population to volunteer in their communities through nonprofits, fire departments and emergency services, according to the latest labor data on volunteerism by occupation.
The Vermont State Employees’ Association, for which I am a trustee, exists to advocate for its members. We believe the governor’s return-to-commute order does the opposite by imposing new housing, childcare and transportation costs on employees who are already meeting job expectations remotely, in a state facing a widely recognized affordability crisis.
We also believe the order violates Vermont’s Flexible Working Arrangements statute (21 V.S.A. § 309) and appears to conflict with employee rights affirmed under National Labor Relations Board rulings governing unilateral changes to working conditions. In raising these concerns, VSEA isn’t just defending its members; it is standing up for workplace protections that benefit all Vermonters.
Public service is measured by outcomes and community impact, not by how many miles someone drives to prove their devotion.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)I moved from Boston to St. Paul in August not knowing what to expect, having talked to the Reformer team a few times and heard tales of the Twin Cities’ “underratedness.” My only experience with the place was a conference in March when the ground was covered with snow and I mostly stayed in the Minneapolis skyways.
Since then, I’ve gotten to know far more about the state’s political landscape, education system, political activists and human services programs than I could have foreshadowed this time last year.
In between writing stories for the Reformer, I’ve also loved exploring the music, food and nature of the Twin Cities and have met some wonderful communities here.
Here are some of my favorite topics from my first few months at the Reformer (plus a freelance piece I wrote in April).
Understanding law enforcement through data
In my role as the newsroom’s data reporter, I’ve tried to get more insight into how law enforcement agencies operate. For example, I wrote a piece in April looking at contracts that federal immigration enforcement has in Minnesota. This was before I joined the Reformer; I had just learned how to search through federal contracts data during the conference in Minneapolis (also where I learned about the Reformer).
Among other findings, I learned that the University of Minnesota was the country’s only university actively contracted with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, via a lease of its gun range to ICE since 2022. University students had already been agitating against ICE and added the issue to its list of demands. The U stopped leasing its gun range to all outside groups, including ICE, in September.
I was able to experience firsthand how my work with publicly available data could translate to an issue for student activists.
I also looked through Minnesota’s asset forfeiture reports, inheriting former Reformer data reporter Chris Ingraham’s interest in the topic. The reports show how much money local law enforcement agencies seize and keep each year, sometimes from people who haven’t yet been convicted of a crime. I found that while state forfeitures dropped — a point of victory for the state’s 2021 asset forfeiture reform — local agencies’ proceeds from federal-state sharing of federal forfeitures went up in the last report.
I learned in the process that the Minneapolis Police Department spent over $500,000 of forfeiture gains on two cars.
Fraud in Minnesota’s Medicaid programs
Fraud in the state’s safety net programs, and the Trump administration’s recent attacks on Somali-Americans in Minnesota superficially related to that fraud, has received enough national attention that my friends in Massachusetts are sending me Instagram Reels on the subject.
In addition to data journalism, I cover health care, so recently I’ve been focused on the defrauding of state-run Medicaid programs designed to serve the disabled and elderly and how  state and federal governments are dealing with fraud.
The story Madison McVan and I wrote on Gov. Tim Walz’s office’s confusing announcement of a third-party audit of Medicaid programs was a lesson in the tricky language of appearance versus reality in politics. The audit is a frequent refrain from Walz when he fields questions about what his administration is doing to address fraud, though a month later, he still didn’t seem to understand the basics of how the audit works.
I don’t expect the average politically-engaged Minnesotan to be interested in the difference between a wholesale pause of 14 Medicaid programs and a pre-payment review of claims in those programs, but the governor who is facing national scrutiny on the topic — that feels a little different.
I’ve spoken to disabled Medicaid recipients and their lawyers; Medicaid providers — some accused of fraud by the state — and their lawyers; and trade organizations for providers, to get a better sense of the impacts of fraud as well as the state’s response.
For example, some providers suspected of disability services fraud were actually helping disabled people at least sometimes (whether they overbilled the state is another matter). This means that some disabled Medicaid recipients were cut off from important services as a result of the Department of Human Services’ crackdown on fraud, recipients’ lawyers told me.
I’m looking forward to going deeper into this subject in the new year, especially after some major recent developments: A federal prosecutor estimated that fraud in those Medicaid programs likely exceeds $9 billion — a figure since questioned by state officials. And the day before that, the House fraud chair dropped anonymized diagrams of fraud networks in assisted living homes and tied them to a Feeding Our Future defendant.
On the personal side, I’m excited to keep exploring Minnesota in 2026.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Proposals for allowing the Hoosier Lottery to sell tickets online and the opening of a Fort Wayne-area casino are in the cards for what could be Indiana’s biggest gambling expansion since sports wagering was legalized in 2019.
Legislators started advancing the Fort Wayne casino plan in December and are expected to take up an online lottery bill soon after they return to the Statehouse in January.
While those look to be the gambling topics most likely to gain traction, some lawmakers also want to authorize internet casino games and to push consideration of a downtown Indianapolis casino.
Rep. Ethan Manning, chair of the House Public Policy Committee that handles gambling-related bills, said he believes “i-lottery is much closer than i-gaming” to winning the approval of lawmakers.
Manning’s committee last year endorsed a bill for both online lottery and casino games, but it didn’t reach the full House for a vote amid concerns that internet gambling would draw business away from physical casinos and risk greater gambling addiction.
Manning, R-Logansport, said during the recent Dentons Legislative Conference that he was sponsoring a bill for this session dealing only with the online lottery.
“I want to try and move that this year, because if we get it passed this year, by the time we pass the bill and get it implemented, we’re talking 12 to 18 months before we start collecting that i-lottery revenue,” Manning said. “If we get it passed this short session, then we’ll have that revenue to consider going into the 2027 budget year.”
Online lottery details
An analysis prepared by the Legislative Services Agency for last session’s proposal projected that online sales would boost the Hoosier Lottery’s revenues by between $314 million and $629 million in the third year.
That would come as the lottery’s sales have been flat at around $1.7 billion for the past five years.
Online lottery sales likely wouldn’t start until the summer of 2027 as lottery officials hire the needed vendors and set up measures to confirm app users are at least 18 years and and are present inside the state lines when making purchases, Hoosier Lottery spokesman Jared Bond said.
If given approval for online sales, the Hoosier Lottery plans to sell both instant games and tickets for jackpot drawings such as Powerball and MegaMillions via the internet, Bond said.
The lottery could also host online instant games on its site.
The addition of online sales was projected to boost the lottery’s annual profits — $340 million for fiscal year 2025 — by between $25 million and $80 million in the third year.
Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan are among 18 states currently with online lottery sales, he said.
“It doesn’t cannibalize traditional lottery,” Bond said. “In essence, it really brings new players to the market and actually helps traditional brick-and-mortar retailers grow as well, sometimes by double digits, in their sales.”
The Indiana Food and Fuel Association, which represents convenience stores, isn’t opposing the push for online lottery sales, according to the group’s lobbyist, Matthew Norris.
“We have learned from the experiences in other states that retailers have not been negatively impacted when i-lottery has been introduced because of the cross-promotional efforts to drive business into brick-and-mortar retailers,” Norris said. “So we look forward to partnering with the Hoosier Lottery to explore ways for retailers to benefit from the new offering.”
Debate over Fort Wayne, Indianapolis casinos
Committees in both the Senate and House got an early start on consideration of the Fort Wayne casino with December public hearings.
The Senate Public Policy Committee voted unanimously Dec. 9 to advance a bill to the full Senate, while the House committee is expected to take action in early January.
Lawmakers are weighing whether to approve the state’s 14th casino license for the Fort Wayne-area project or allow the Rising Star Casino from southeastern Indiana — owned and operated by Full House Resorts — to move there. That Ohio River casino generates the least casino tax in the state and has seen revenues plummet since casinos opened in Ohio and gambling expanded in Kentucky.
Rep. Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, speaks at the annual Dentons Legislative Conference on Dec. 18. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Manning said he supported transferring the Rising Star license to Fort Wayne as such a move would help Indiana’s two other Cincinnati-area casinos in a market that has changed greatly since those opened more than 25 years ago.
“I think that’s something we need to consider moving forward, not just solving one problem, solving more than one at the same time,” Manning said.
A study released by the Indiana Gaming Commission in October found that Indianapolis was the top location for a casino relocation, followed by northeast Indiana.
While the Indianapolis region would bring the state more tax revenue, it would also hurt the two casinos nearby in Shelbyville and Anderson that also have horse tracks and help support the horse racing industry. The Fort Wayne aarea was seen as more of an open market, impacting casinos in Ohio and Michigan.
Some Indianapolis lawmakers are advocating for a downtown casino in the city, but they face resistance from Republican House Speaker Todd Huston and others.
“I believe the Indianapolis market is already adequately served by the current gaming facilities,” Huston said in a statement. “I do support exploring a new gaming license in Northeast Indiana and the economic development opportunities it could bring to the region.” 
Approval for new casinos in Gary and Terre Haute came in the state’s last major gaming expansion bill in 2019, when lawmakers also allowed the start of sports wagering.

A new restaurant is planned to open in the space in 2026 (Thomas White/The Beacon).The economy has developed a split personality.
Stock prices are near record levels. Some tech companies, particularly in the AI space, are being valued at staggering numbers, fueling a rush to develop data centers.
Meanwhile, half of workers are struggling to get by and lines for food assistance block traffic.
The mixed signals can get confusing. But if you really want to know what’s going on, here’s a tip — ask a bartender.
Restaurant and hospitality workers have a front-row view of our current mixed or “K-shaped” economy — where the top is booming while the rest are scrimping.
“People are spending their money either carelessly or more carefully,” longtime bartender Perla Jacobo told The Beacon. “It’s honestly one of the two. They’re either endlessly consuming or being really intentional about how much they’re spending.”
Clocking in at almost 100,000 workers, the restaurant industry is the third-largest occupational group in the Kansas City area. These workers see who has discretionary money to spend and how many people are walking through the door. Since the industry is also notoriously fickle, they feel economic shifts before almost anyone else.
“I think we are a good bellwether,” Mike Burris, executive director of the Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association, said about restaurants in the broader economy.
For example, restaurant workers felt the economic effects of the COVID pandemic first and the industry is still dealing with a lagging local recovery, which mirrors broader regional trends. While everyone is dealing with higher food prices, your favorite brunch spot knew about that run on eggs before everyone except the chickens. Likewise, rising rents rank among the most common reasons restaurants close.
With that in mind, it sets off alarm bells as we see several area restaurants and bars close this year, especially ahead of the always-busy holiday season and a promised boom from the World Cup. But the answer to why that’s happening — just like the economy at large — is complicated.
 The closures

Recent closures read like a who’s who in the Kansas City hospitality scene.

Corvino Supper Club is closing after nearly eight years.
Afterword Tavern & Shelves is closing after seven years but looking for a new home.
D’Bronx closed its last location after 35 years in the area.
Brio Italian Grille, Chuy’s and Seasons 52 all shuttered this year as part of a wave of “strategic closures” by the new owners of the Country Club Plaza.
Waldo Thai changed ownership after seven years of operation and closed indefinitely two months ago.
Gilhouly’s dive bar closed after 29 years.
Plate Restaurant Group went from expansion plans to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize this year (and remains in operation).
Happy Gillis closed after 17 years. New owners plan to open a different restaurant in the space next year.
Bar K closed despite a regional expansion after nearly a decade.
Homesteader Cafe closed after 10 years.
Danny Edwards Blvd. BBQ closed after 18 years in the location.

Each of these restaurants and bars closed or filed bankruptcy this year for its own unique combination of reasons. Some stated explanations for closing include lease disputes, rising costs, personal decisions, lower alcohol sales and dwindling foot traffic.
“There have been a few of them here (closed restaurants) that I’ve been surprised about,” Burris said. “About a third of most restaurants’ income is in the last two months of the year… If they feel like they aren’t seeing or going to see those sales increases, then there’s no reason for them to stay open longer.”
Burris says that there is a natural churn in openings and closings, and that despite the closings he sees the area’s restaurant industry as generally healthy.
The National Restaurant Association — which is made up of groups like Burris’ Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association — published a survey in late November showing that 48% of restaurant operators reported higher same-store sales in October than a year earlier.
But what complicates things is that the same survey reported that 35% said sales were down and 48% reported lower customer traffic in October when compared to last year. A plurality of operators have reported reduced same-store foot traffic nearly every month this year.
Generally, sales are up or the same but fewer people are going into restaurants. That’s a street-level indicator of the K-shaped economy at work.
 What is a K-shaped economy?

Jacob Brewer is the general manager of Noka, a Japanese restaurant in Martini Corner. He says business has been great. Noka’s checks typically average $50-$100 a person, according to reviews, and Brewer said they routinely fill and turn the 88-seat restaurant.
He sees signs of distress in the larger economy — ticking off tariffs, rising food costs and overall inflation — even as Noka’s sales are significantly up year over year. This confuses him.
“I see videos of people waiting in food lines and then I see a full restaurant going on a wait every single weekend,” Brewer said. “It’s such a weird dynamic because I keep thinking people are going to stop eating out because they can’t afford it, but I’m just not seeing it here.”

Brewer isn’t wrong to be confounded. The economic data supports both realities existing simultaneously. Economists have dubbed it the “K-shaped” economy.
The term was popularized by William & Mary economics professor Peter Atwater. He told the Associated Press this month that inflation has hurt households that make less than $100,000 while asset inflation has helped those with wealth.
The result is a “K” where there are gains at the top, decline for the bottom and a shrinking middle. In recent years and especially since the COVID pandemic, the top income earners have largely driven economic gains while the bottom two-thirds have struggled with rising costs.
“For the last five to seven years, the economy has been driven almost entirely by people in the upper third of income earners,” Chris Kuehl, an economist who co-founded Armada Corporate Intelligence, told The Beacon in August.
This trend shows up in your favorite restaurant.
A September report from the National Restaurant Association said that nearly $6 out of every $10 spent in restaurants come from households that make more than $100,000, based on 2023 data. Meanwhile 44% of lower-income Americans making roughly less than $50,000 a year say they are eating out less this year compared to 2024, according to a YouGov survey.
Jacobo confirmed seeing a lower volume of overall restaurant and bar guests in recent years. In the spaces where she’s worked since the COVID pandemic, she’s seeing a mix of higher-end clientele and people out for a special occasion but fewer blue-collar regulars.
The Beacon spoke to several front-line restaurant workers who weren’t comfortable speaking publicly for fear of losing their jobs or hurting the reputation of the establishment where they work. One bartender in Lee’s Summit shared that foot traffic was down 25% and that take-home pay is also down as a result.
“There’s definitely a tale of two cities going on here,” he said. “The wealthy are still coming out spending big. I see them more than the average Joe coming in after a hard day of work.”
 ‘Shrinking market’

Forbes Cross spent nearly 50 years in the Kansas City restaurant business, owning 14 establishments before retiring and closing Brookside’s Michael Forbes Grille in 2024. He’s seen trends come and go.
He said this feels different.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Beige Book said that consumer spending is weakening as foot traffic and leisure activities have slowed. The local Fed cites a softening labor market paired with the recent government shutdown among the reasons.
“The markets just shrank,” Cross said about the restaurant industry after COVID. “That upper-middle class on down — I think they’re staying home more.”
He described a calculus that’s become familiar to anyone watching their bank account. A nice dinner out with a bottle of wine can easily run $150 to $200. The same meal at home costs roughly $50 to $75.
Fewer people in the door means fewer workers are needed.
Frank Lenk, the Mid-America Regional Council’s director of economic research, said the Kansas City area is in a “jobcession,” meaning growth hasn’t stopped entirely, but it’s low enough that unemployment keeps ticking upward.

The restaurant industry locally has only recovered to 85.9% of its pre-pandemic level, according to Lenk’s local economic outlook. Lenk also projected accommodation and food services — the sector that includes restaurants — to be down 1,541 jobs in 2025.
“It’s just economics,” Cross said. “People just can’t afford to eat out as much as they used to.”
Public opinion backs him up.
A 2024 survey from Vericast found that 68% of consumers are “trading down” from restaurant meals to cooking at home. A 2025 YouGov survey said that two-thirds of diners who dine out less frequently cite increasing prices as the reason.
Burris is quick to point out higher food prices — up 29% overall since 2020 — rose across the board, so it’s more expensive both at restaurants and grocery stores. But most restaurants use a pricing strategy where food costs are targeted to be 30% of the listed menu price for customers. This is to account for the other two large costs for restaurant operators: labor and fixed overhead.
 Restaurant challenges mirror broader challenges

Cross said that when restaurants see higher costs, they have to raise prices or risk eroding already thin profit margins. He said the average restaurant works with a 5% profit margin and even the strongest restaurants rarely exceed 15%.
From 2020 onward Cross watched his food costs climb from the low 30% target past 40%. Beef prices have risen nearly 15% in just the past year, with ground beef topping $6 per pound for the first time in history. And unlike grocers, restaurants can’t just update their prices with a click.
“You’ve got to be sensitive about raising prices,” Cross said. “We did it in smaller increments. Maybe raise the menu prices around a dollar, then next year another dollar. But we probably should have been raising them two and three dollars, because the costs kept going up. You kept hoping the costs would come down. They didn’t.”
Customers notice. YouGov found that 82% of Americans think that restaurants have raised their prices this year and only 28% think those prices are fair.

Brewer said that tariffs have impacted speciality product prices and availability.
“There’s been a drastic difference,” Brewer said. “There are certain wines that we flat out aren’t able to get anymore. The French and Italians aren’t exporting wine like they used to because they don’t want to absorb that cost and neither do the distributors here in America. Tariffs are the worst economic idea of all time.”
Many of the restaurants that closed in the past year cited a lease disagreement as the reason for their closure. According to Redfin, the median sale price for a home is up roughly 32% over the last five years in Kansas City. As real estate prices rise, landlords will ask restaurants for more money.
Cross said rent is the one cost restaurant owners can’t easily adjust.
“The rent is fixed. You can’t change it unless you can renegotiate with the landlord,” he said. “Labor, you can cut hours. Food, you can adjust your menu. But the rent — nine times out of ten, they’re not going to lower it.”
For many operators, getting a rent increase means it’s time to close up shop.
“The rent going up is maybe the last straw,” Burris said. “Because everything’s gone up and it’s tougher to compete.”
 Uncertainty ahead

Restaurants have always been a volatile business. The failure rate is brutal even in good times. But the current moment tells us how this economy is going for working people.
“The first thing people cut is entertainment,” Cross said. “Obviously, the economy is going to tell us a lot.”
The same forces squeezing restaurants — rising food costs, elevated rents, tariffs — are squeezing households across the region. The same K-shaped recovery that fills some dining rooms with people living at the top of the K clears out food bank shelves with people living at the bottom of the K.
Steady restaurant sales seem to mask that fewer people are dining out since those who can still afford it are spending more.
Some Kansas City restaurants saw the promise of the World Cup coming to town in six months, but couldn’t white-knuckle through the rising costs to make it until then.
Taken together this doesn’t necessarily mean a recession is coming. But to the households making less than $100,000, it sure feels like they are living through one.
“In about six months we can revisit this conversation, and we’ll see,” said Brewer.

Green Mountain shoppers feared change when the Aubuchon chain acquired a string of locally owned businesses. They didn’t expect the biggest shift would be the arrival of cats with their own timely fundraiser.

Brattleboro’s Brown and Roberts Hardware has sold the nuts and bolts of life for more than a century. So when the Aubuchon chain announced it was acquiring the business and six other locally owned Vermont stores in 2024, the news gave shoppers pause.
Make that paws.
“Please welcome our newest employees!” reads an entrance sign featuring a photo of two black cats. “Keep them safe and shut the door.”
Makita and Milwaukee — named after popular brands of power tools — can’t run the registers, recommend paint or restock brushes, light bulbs or batteries. But they nonetheless help the Brattleboro landmark and nearly 30 other Vermont locations purr along, according to Ben Aubuchon, fourth-generation marketing manager of the nation’s oldest and largest family-owned hardware chain.
The company introduced its first cats decades ago to scare off mice drawn by the sale of animal feed.
“We found that just the smell of a cat would typically be enough to keep mice away,” Aubuchon says.
Conversely, the felines attracted customers, spurring the chain to adopt more of them. At Manchester’s Aubuchon Hardware, for example, shoppers gravitate to its mattress-like stack of charcoal bags less for the product and more for a peek at Delilah napping atop like “The Princess and the Pea.”

“The majority of our cats now are more mascots than rodent control,” Aubuchon says of the more than 100 at its 132 U.S. stores.
Although the cats differ in size, color and age, most were rescued from local animal shelters.
“The cats we get often have extra toes or some sort of what people might call a defect,” Aubuchon says.
But that hasn’t stopped them from clawing their way into the company’s social media — photos appear weekly with the hashtag #storecatsunday — and the first Hardware Store Cat Calendar, a fundraiser for the nonprofit Aubuchon Foundation that supports community causes.
Flip through the 2026 edition and you’ll find Delilah amid the aisles in March, Grant from Burlington’s Bibens Ace Hardware checking out color samples in April, Aggie from Jeffersonville’s Aubuchon Hardware on the computer (literally) in June, Moma from Bristol’s Martin’s Hardware and Building Supply sleeping on a shelf in August and Bubbles from Vergennes’ Aubuchon Ace Hardware alongside fall gardening fixtures in October.
The marketing manager is diplomatic when asked why all of Vermont’s store cats aren’t pictured.
“We didn’t pick cats thinking one’s better than the other,” he says. “We said, ‘If you want your cat to be featured, you need to send us a high-resolution photo,’ and we ended up with only a handful.”
That’s why the Brattleboro cats aren’t included — although their absence didn’t stop locals from buying up all the calendars there.
The Jeffersonville store, for its part, still has a stack of unsold copies, even though its feline is featured. A clerk has a simple explanation why locals aren’t taking home the pictorial.
“You can come in and pet the cat in person.”

A state Supreme Court race blows the doors off spending records, and another one is waiting in the wings.
Each of those could be considered a big story by itself in Wisconsin, but they’re all part of this year’s single biggest story in government and politics. And that story — that it was a really big year for Wisconsin politics — wasn’t just about 2025: It set the stage for 2026.
The  three-stories-in-one about Wisconsin politics are just the beginning of the news that flooded our pages in 2025. Wisconsin Examiner’s five-person staff published 550 stories in 2025, a total that includes opinion columns by Editor Ruth Conniff, but doesn’t include briefs that also appeared under the bylines of Conniff, Erik Gunn, Isiah Holmes, Henry Redman, Baylor Spears and Criminal Justice Fellows Andrew Kennard and Frank Zufall.
Herewith, then, our list of 10 big stories that the Wisconsin Examiner covered over the course of the last year.

1. Wisconsin politics goes into overdrive
Democratic Gov. Tony Evers put an end to the last Wisconsin governor’s quest for a third term when he defeated Republican Scott Walker in 2018. Midway through his own second term, Evers surprised many by deciding to call it quits when his current  term ends rather than run again.
The decision created the first open race for governor in more than a decade and opened the floodgates, with a bevy of Democrats entering the fray. By contrast, the Republican field was down to two at year’s end, with one early contender dropping out after the entry of Congressman Tom Tiffany.
In the Wisconsin Legislature, Democrats, having narrowed the Republicans’ majority in 2024 thanks to new maps that undid the state’s 15 years of GOP gerrymandering, launched twin efforts to flip both the Assembly and the Senate in 2026. Republicans vowed to maintain their majority in both houses.
The new Senate and Assembly maps were made possible after the 2023 state Supreme Court election flipped the seven-member Court’s ideological majority from conservative to liberal. With the balance of the Court  at stake again after liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley retired in 2025, Democrats went all out, electing Dane County Judge Susan Crawford to the nominally nonpartisan Court and handily overcoming the efforts of billionaire Elon Musk who spent millions  supporting Crawford’s opponent, former state Attorney General Brad Schimel. The contest set both state and national records for campaign spending in a U.S. judicial election, and maintained the one-vote liberal majority. Now supporters of the current Court majority have their eyes on extending that ideological advantage in 2026. 
Chris Taylor, currently a District IV appeals court judge and a former Democratic state representative, is running to succeed sharply conservative Rebecca Bradley. Bradley opted not to seek a new term on the Court, and conservative Appeals Court Judge Maria Lazar has announced plans to seek the post.

2. A  bipartisan state budget splits both parties
Evers went into the 2025-27 state budget process with an ambitious list of goals. Lengthy negotiations between the Democratic governor and Republican lawmakers produced a deal. While the final result fell well short of his original vision, Evers claimed victory nevertheless, with gains on paper for child care funding and for public school special education funding.
Both, however, left their strongest advocates disappointed, and by the end of the year, the special education funding did not live up to the promises made when the budget was signed.

3. Public school troubles
The budget’s lack of additional school aid for regular classes was especially upsetting to public school advocates, and was exacerbated by the state’s expanding school choice systems that use tax dollars to pay for private schools and charter schools outside the common public schools. It also underscored the extent to which local communities have been voting to raise their own property taxes to support their school systems.
The defeat of some school referendum requests further accentuated the sense of crisis, while Republican lawmakers called for new restrictions on the referendum process. And in the state’s largest system, Milwaukee Public Schools, an audit called for sweeping changes in response to a range of challenges, from declining enrollments and staff turnover to the continuing pressure of having to fund the parallel voucher and charter systems.
Throughout the year, the state Department of Public Instruction came under intense scrutiny from Republican lawmakers over policies ranging from school performance evaluations to the handling of sexual abuse complaints against school employees.

 4. Federal fallout from a new administration
With the inauguration of President Donald Trump to a second term in the White House, the fallout from new federal actions reached Wisconsin in a myriad of ways. The giant legislation to cut taxes (mostly for the wealthy) and spending (much of it for health care) that Trump signed in July was one cause, setting the stage for future cuts to Medicaid and to health care under the Affordable Care Act, while also imposing new restrictions on programs aimed at reducing hunger.
But there were other reductions as well, some coming from the actions of the “Department of Government Efficiency” or DOGE that Trump authorized, and others from unilateral — and often legally challenged — actions by the administration itself. Clean energy and climate change projects, scientific research, education assistance, help with removing lead from public schools, community service, child care, economic policies, numerous federal agencies and the federal workforce itself along with countless other federal initiatives were swept up in the administration’s first year.
The record-long federal shutdown — when Congress failed to agree on a temporary spending plan and the GOP majority refused to extend extra tax breaks for Affordable Care Act health plans into 2026 — added to the chaos, with a temporary halt to the federal SNAP food assistance program.
Wisconsinites joined people from across the country in the recurring protests that started just weeks into the Trump presidency, culminating in the Oct. 18 “No Kings” rallies from coast to coast that some analysts identified as the largest mass protest ever in the United States.

5. Immigration arrests spark turmoil
The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown reverberated in Wisconsin from Inauguration Day. At the start of this term, Editor Ruth Conniff traveled to Mexico, documenting the longstanding relationships Wisconsin farmers have had with migrants who provide 70% of the labor that the state’s dairy industry has relied on.
Republican lawmakers called for cementing the state’s relationship with the newly unleashed Immigration and Customs Enforcement — ICE — agency , while the Evers administration resisted those calls. Individual counties signed on to assist ICE, sometimes facing opposition, but while Wisconsin was less in the national spotlight than other states, it wasn’t immune to periodic episodes of immigration enforcement.
Visa cancellations caught up students from overseas, and migrant arrests rose across the state. Immigration enforcement officers focused on the Milwaukee County Courthouse in their search for immigrants to take into custody, prompting criticism from advocates who warned the result would drive migrants underground rather than encouraging them to show up for court dates as witnesses, plaintiffs or defendants.
After a four-day trial in December, Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan was convicted on a felony charge of obstruction but acquitted of a misdemeanor charge of concealing a man who had appeared in her courtroom in April and was targeted by immigration officials. The case had national repercussions as the Trump administration targets judges it sees as opponents to its policies.

 6. Environment: Data centers, stewardship and PFAS conflicts
In Wisconsin a statewide — indeed, nationwide — the rush to embrace massive data centers to serve emerging artificial intelligence-based technology sparked widespread debate over water use, electricity demands and power generation.
Meanwhile, a longstanding and widely popular land preservation program — the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship fund — hovered on the verge of collapse as Republican lawmakers demanded the power to veto stewardship decisions after a state Supreme Court ruling in 2024 removed the Legislature from the process.
After a running battle against rerouting an Enbridge oil pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers approved permits for the project over the strenuous objections of opponents, only to be sued by the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.
A standoff between the Evers administration and the Legislature’s Republican leaders over how to address PFAS “forever chemicals” was eased by a state Supreme Court ruling allowing the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to apply Wisconsin’s spills law to PFAS contamination, along with a bipartisan bill that would require the DNR to notify local and tribal officials about groundwater PFAS contamination.

7.  Law enforcement: Investigating themselves, surveillance of the public
A lengthy investigation by Isiah Holmes of the Wisconsin Examiner in partnership with Type Investigations documented how the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team, assigned to probe death investigations for people killed by metro Milwaukee police officers, use protocols that grant officers privileges not afforded to the general public.
Among many other issues involving policing and law enforcement in Wisconsin, police surveillance was a recurring matter, with debates arising over facial recognition technology, department interest in expanding phone-tracking resources and increasing attention to how police agencies make use of widespread surveillance cameras.

 8. Prison reform struggles
Evers’ budget proposal included a sweeping plan for prison reform, but the  result was more limited, leaving advocates dissatisfied. One concrete element is the start of a project to close the Green Bay Correctional Institution, a longtime objective, but divisions remain between the governor and GOP lawmakers about the details.

 9. Voting rights debates revive 2020 election denial
With the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, the conspiracy theories that were amplified after his reelection loss in November 2020 got a new burst of energy. The Wisconsin Elections Commission twice rejected an administration demand for the personal identifying information of Wisconsin voters.
Trump issued a largely symbolic pardon of the Republicans who signed certificates falsely stating he won the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin, while a Dane County judge kept alive a criminal case against three men charged with orchestrating the fake elector scheme.
Although bipartisan lawmakers in the Assembly sought common ground over absentee ballot drop boxes and a measure to allow election clerks to begin counting absentee ballots on the Monday before Election Day, their efforts stalled.
10. Flooding and disasters
August flooding in Southeast Wisconsin that followed torrential storms and was centered on the metro Milwaukee area left behind devastation, damaging nearly 2,000 homes and some $34 million worth of public infrastructure.
The Trump administration’s Federal Emergency Management Agency approved $30 million in initial relief to support the victims of flood damage, but the administration denied a subsequent request for aid to mitigate future disasters.

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City on Aug. 13. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A mandate that public schools offer free meals to all students appears to have failed to capture widespread support in the GOP-controlled Oklahoma Legislature after being ignored by school districts.
Former state Superintendent Ryan Walters in July ordered all districts in the state to eliminate their cafeteria fees and provide breakfasts and lunches for free. Walters, who resigned from office a few months later to lead a nonprofit, contended public schools had plenty of funds already in their coffers to afford it.
But, state lawmakers have “turned the page and quit worrying about what he said,” Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, told Oklahoma Voice.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

Lowe, who leads the House Common Education Committee, said the state might be “tight on income” next year, and providing universal free meals would require a major expense. 
Collections in the state’s General Revenue Fund have been lower over the first five months of the 2026 fiscal year than in the same span the year before, according to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services.
Hunger Free Oklahoma, an organization advocating for free meal expansion, estimates it would cost the state $80 million to $100 million to fund free meals for all public school students.
Lawmakers expect to be “hyper-focused” on other issues, particularly improving childhood literacy, Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant. He said there’s little appetite for eliminating cafeteria costs.
“I think right now, you have kids that can pay for it, and if they can, then let the parents pay for the meal, and let’s focus on getting kids a high-quality education,” Bullard said.

Democrats, though, will continue to advocate for the policy, said House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City.
House Bill 2092 from Rep. Annie Menz, D-Norman, and Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, would expand universal free meals to more districts. The bill will carry over into the 2026 legislative session after failing to get a committee hearing in 2025.
“Oklahoma continues to face difficult challenges when it comes to public education,” Munson said in a statement. “That is due in part to the disservice of Ryan Walters, who made several promises that he left unfulfilled when he resigned. Universal school meals for public school students has always and will remain a priority policy change supported by House Democrats.”
Families whose household income is at or near the federal poverty line qualify for free or reduced-priced meals in any public school.
Nearly 280,000 Oklahoma students attended a public school that provided meals at no cost to all enrolled in 2024, according to a June report from Hunger Free Oklahoma. 
Across the state, 267 districts and 849 individual public schools offer free meals to all of their students through a federal program known as the Community Eligibility Provision. The program provides federal reimbursements to schools based on their student poverty levels.

Districts that aren’t eligible or that qualify for minimal federal support from the program said Walters’ order would be financially unviable, even with drastic cuts to other expenses. Multiple district leaders said they had no plans to comply with the mandate, despite Walters’ threat of sanctions.
His order also sought to ban from school meals any “ultra-processed” foods, certain artificial dyes, seed oils and produce grown with pesticides. School kitchens would struggle to comply without extra funding, added training and reliable access to fresh, local ingredients, the School Nutrition Association of Oklahoma said.
Walters issued his mandate a week after the yearly deadline to apply for Community Eligibility Provision funding, exacerbating frustrations about the viability of his order. Lawmakers and policy experts said Walters had no authority to singlehandedly create such a requirement.
New state Superintendent Lindel Fields, appointed after Walters’ resignation, hasn’t attempted to enforce the order or pursue it further. 
“I believe we can all agree that students learn best when their basic needs are met, including having a full stomach,” Fields said in a statement. “This is an important issue, and I think it would be worthwhile to discuss potential solutions that benefit all students.”

I’ve covered the Wyoming Legislature for 13 years, and more closely since joining WyoFile several years ago, but I’d never seen such a concentration of bills that truly provoked people. There were controversies about letting landowners cash in on special hunting tags (a fight that’s ongoing), stripping a protective state status for otters, overriding Wyoming Game and Fish’s authority to manage mountain lions, hunting grizzly bears despite the Endangered Species Act and a quarrel over a proposed ban on the Wyoming tradition of killing wildlife with snowmobiles.
And that’s a partial list. Notably, the most divisive measures almost all died midstream in the lawmaking process. The fizzling of wildlife-related legislation freed me to cover the steady stream of headlines during the early days of the second Trump administration.

Former Wyoming Game and Fish Department Director Brian Nesvik was appointed to direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, overseeing wildlife issues nationally. (In a total coincidence, I happened to be in Washington, D.C. during one of his confirmation hearings, and we brought you that news from the Capitol.) Around then, the federal government made more headlines with new logging policy, grizzly bear management and more.
Otherwise, most Trump administration-spurred WyoFile headlines related to the doings of the now-defunct “Department of Government Efficiency,” then-led by the richest man in the world, Elon Musk. There were scores of Wyoming federal workers abruptly let go from their jobs at a wide array of agencies with a big presence in a state that’s half federal land. Federal offices were scheduled to close, and at other facilities, small workforces were gutted, resulting in chaos.

This was tricky reporting! The federal agency sources we’ve cultivated over the years were mostly barred from communicating with the media — the policy, in most cases, amounted to secrecy. To report the facts about the layoffs and cuts, we had to get creative, and at times, offer sources anonymity. Memorably, another outlet, the Columbia Journalism Review, even interviewed my colleague Angus Thuermer and me about what it was like having to report on the DOGE cuts. 
An icon of the American West — elk — also kept me occupied in the early months of 2025. Although it’s no longer the case, for the vast majority of my time in Wyoming, I’ve hung my hat in Teton and Sublette counties, where elk herds are congregated by the thousands on feedgrounds in the winter. But now those elk populations and, by extension, elk hunting, face an unprecedented threat, wildlife disease ecologists believe. Always-lethal chronic wasting disease started appearing last winter, and by the end of the season, there had been four feedgrounds where it was verified, including one spot where CWD is gaining steam. We’ve reported recently that winter 2025-’26 will be an “important” harbinger of what’s to come.

Broadly speaking, the tension between conservation and development is another wildlife issue that’s emerged repeatedly on my beat. There’s been controversy over the Wyoming State Shooting Complex’s location in the wild Absaroka Range foothills. And there have been many twists and turns in the long-term effort to protect Wyoming’s first pronghorn migration corridor. I’ve also kept a close eye on the back and forth on the federal level over allowing oil and gas leasing and drilling within two regions the migratory Sublette Pronghorn Herd depends on: the Red Desert and the Golden Triangle. 
While these topics are destined to receive more ink in 2026, I had many one-of-a-kind stories in 2025: I photographed a goshawk, and reported on others seeing cool critters like the southernmost great gray owl in North America, out-of-place mammals like a swift fox and “accidental” bird species showing up in Wyoming.

Last, I’d like to highlight some of the cool project stories that I’m proud to have been a part of publishing in 2025. 
In January, I teamed with Amanda Eggert at the Montana Free Press for an oral history-style feature story, marking the 30th anniversary of wolf reintroduction into the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In October, WyoFile partnered with Western Confluence, a publication of the University of Wyoming’s Ruckelshaus Institute, to produce another history-heavy feature story, this one about the stalemate over wild horse management in Wyoming’s checkerboard region.

He’s flanked by wolf activist Renee Askins, right, and Mollie Beattie, then director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (Courtesy)
Then, in November, WyoFile and the Mountain Journal hit publish on an investigative story co-written with Montana journalist Nick Mott. We explored what happens when wolves naive to hunting leave the protective confines of Yellowstone National Park. For me, that story was years in the making. A tip about the fate of an individual wolf in May 2022 first got me thinking about how to constructively write about this loaded topic. 
The final feature story I want to mention was also a long time in the making, though this one was a WyoFile production alone. I examined Wyoming’s fight against nonnative cheatgrass, which one scientist I interviewed called the “most existential, sweeping threat” to western ecosystems. After learning a bunch, I tend to agree. So look for more reporting on efforts to prevent noxious annual grasses from overtaking Wyoming landscapes in 2026. 
I’m always hunting for stories, and please reach out any time: mike@wyofile.com.

If politicians want us to elect them to public office, they must commit to protecting our public lands, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Public land as political fulcrum appeared first on WyoFile .","Our national debate over what to do with unoccupied land within our borders has been going on since before the ink was dry on our Constitution. The two original protagonists were none other than Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, and their disagreement endures to this day.

Opinion

Hamilton, a closet monarchist, wanted the United States to give its unoccupied land to rich, elite men to create a landed aristocracy that would support the new government. European monarchs had used this ploy for centuries, resulting in dukes and barons who would express their appreciation by supporting the crown during war.
Jefferson believed that the land should belong to the common American, so that the new country could expand by “yeoman farmers” working their own land, instead of through neo-feudal American fiefdoms. Thankfully, Jefferson’s wisdom prevailed and our vast public lands are the legacy he left us.
Jefferson’s legacy is worth considering today. Because of his foresight, each American citizen is a shareholder in 650 million acres of our homeland. That is a landmass larger than all but nine countries in the modern world. This public land remains largely as God created it, unspoiled by commercial development.
While Hamilton would have given our land to greedy hedge fund managers who would have bulldozed and paved it for strip malls, theme parks and condos, Jefferson kept it in our hands as our birthright.
This outcome wasn’t the result of any election, but rather one vision of America’s future prevailing over another. Yet our public land is not immune to the results of elections. Elected political forces in our country are persistently trying to pry public land from our hands and turn it over to commercial interests to exploit. When we resist that nonsense, we justify Jefferson’s faith in us as citizens.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

Last year saw the most recent attempt to divest us of our public land, when Utah Sen. Mike Lee tried to add a provision to the Big Beautiful Bill that would have sold millions of acres of public land to construct housing. The national outrage over this proposal made Lee withdraw it.
The Wyoming congressional delegation did not weigh in on the side of the citizens, but was supportive of Lee’s boondoggle.
It must be noted that Lee’s provision was entirely unnecessary. Existing laws, both the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, already allow the federal government to transfer public land to communities for expanding infrastructure, including housing. So Lee and his supporters had another motive in mind when they tried to pry our public land from our hands.
With election season crowding in upon us, those of us who cherish Jefferson’s legacy should be on our guard for politicians who follow Hamilton’s misguided doctrine and who want to sell our public land to the highest bidder. We should hold their feet to the fire and insist they come clean on where they stand with regard to public land.
Candidates for U.S. Senate on down to Meeteetse’s dogcatcher, should be grilled on this issue, and if necessary, dragged kicking and screaming to be open about their positions on disposal of public land. This should be a question at every campaign whistle stop, town hall, candidate questionnaire and interview in the coming months. If they are not on the side of the vast majority of Wyomingites on this issue, they must be forced to declare their opposition in the public square.
Public land policy should become the fulcrum by which we elevate aspiring politicians to positions of trust in the Big Empty, or deny them the office they covet.
When candidates promise us that they are on our side with important topics like taxes, education and all the other hot-button issues of the day, we must corner them into explaining their stance on public land before we trust them with our vote. If they have lied to us before about it, or if they lie to us this time, we have to remind them that their terms in office are short compared to our memories. Very short indeed.
Aspiring candidates would do themselves a favor by not underestimating our love for public land and knowing that if they do so, they put their political futures in peril. And we would do ourselves a service if we honor Jefferson’s gift to us by protecting it with our votes. If politicians want us to give them a public office, they must commit to preserving our public land.

Dele Davies (University of Nebraska Medical Center, interim), Joanne Li (University of Nebraska at Omaha) and Neal Schnoor (University of Nebraska at Kearney). Dec. 5, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska at Kearney’s finalization this month of a plan to trim its budget by $4.5 million brings total cuts across the University of Nebraska in this budget year to $43 million.
UNK’s total annual budget is about $170 million, including $80.3 million primarily from tuition and taxpayer dollars.
UNK academic cuts proposed
UNK’s final budget proposal mirrors much of an original plan announced Dec. 9, less $300,000 after campus feedback. Campus leadership chose to preserve a family science bachelor’s degree and one related faculty position, and there will be fewer across-the-board cuts and reduced graduate assistantships than proposed.
A history instructor will also be retained as UNK seeks to revamp its online master’s degree in public history to increase demand via expanded online marketing.


NU budget cuts, fall 2025
University of Nebraska-Lincoln: $27.5 million
University of Nebraska Medical Center: $9.1 million
University of Nebraska at Kearney: $4.5 million
University of Nebraska at Omaha: $1.9 million


The NU Board of Regents will consider eliminating four other UNK degrees in early 2026:

Higher education student affairs, master of science in education (eight candidates).
Music comprehensive – music business emphasis, bachelor of music (three majors).
Modern languages — German emphasis, bachelor of arts (one major).
Modern languages 7-12 teaching endorsement — German emphasis, bachelor of arts in education (zero majors).

UNK’s eight-member Faculty Advisory Committee differed from first-year UNK Chancellor Neal Schnoor on the family science degree but recommended eliminating the other programs at Schnoor’s suggestion. Any students in eliminated programs would be “taught out” to graduation.
The rest of the UNK budget reduction plan is final and does not require regents approval.
UNL, UNMC and UNO cuts
Elsewhere, cuts were finalized in early August at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, to close a $1.9 million structural deficit, and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where the campus did not have a structural deficit but cut $9.1 million, partly to address current and potential future shortfalls in federal support for research activities.
UNO’s cuts included “internal financial management,” the campus announced in August, such as “efficiencies” and expanded revenue. UNMC cuts included a 4% across-the-board reduction, as well as participating in the NU-wide faculty buyout package and not filling some open positions.
‘This hurts’: NU regents back shuttering four academic programs at UNL

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln had a much larger structural deficit to close than its sister campuses, at $21 million. UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett chose to cut deeper, by $6.5 million, which he had said was designed to mitigate future budget shortfalls
The NU regents on Dec. 5 approved various academic program eliminations and mergers, which Bennett’s team estimated would save $8.4 million. Dozens of faculty and hundreds of students are in those affected areas.
Tenured faculty across UNL, UNMC, UNO and UNK have until Jan. 5 to accept a buyout if they applied and were among the 116 faculty who campus leaders offered the agreement and its lump sum payment.
Of UNK’s now 19 faculty positions proposed for elimination, three faculty would be let go. Nine more positions would come open through an early retirement bonus for long-time tenured faculty, and the remaining seven would close already open positions.
Non-academic UNK reductions
The rest of UNK’s budget proposal seeks $2.3 million in non-academic reductions:

Seven open staff positions and a part-time custodial post ($559,993).
Fewer tuition waivers for athletics, Kearney Health and Kearney Law Opportunities Programs, though UNK hopes to find replacement funds using private philanthropy ($400,000).
Across-the-board 5% reduction in state-aided budgets ($350,000).
Reduced graduate assistantships ($250,000).
Reduction in summer salary budget ($200,000).
Reduced athletics operations ($200,000).
Eliminate the vice chancellor of enrollment management position and a vacant office associate position ($153,983).
Vacate the Memorial Student Affairs Building and Thomas Hall to avoid costly repairs ($85,047).
Restructuring of the Office of International Engagement and Leadership ($66,630).
Reduce and clarify UNK support for the Museum of Nebraska Art in a new memorandum of understanding, beginning in fiscal year 2027-28 ($35,649).
Changes to institutional marketing and engagement for savings at the College of Business and Technology ($18,737).

“We recognize the impact these decisions have on our campus community,” Schnoor said Monday. “I am truly grateful to faculty and staff for their personal investment, time, effort and resilience throughout this process.”

Jason Crow's office)In December 2003, Jason Crow landed in the Baltimore airport on a Delta flight from Kuwait. 
Christmas music played in the terminal. The airport was decorated for the holidays. Families were preparing for holiday travel. 
Before the flight from Kuwait, Crow had left Baghdad on a military flight. Before the military flight, Crow’s transport had been ambushed, and a firefight ended in the deaths of several Iraqi soldiers. Before that, Crow led a platoon of Army paratroopers on over 100 combat missions during the U.S. invasion of Iraq throughout 2003.
But once he was back in Baltimore, a rental car company wouldn’t lease Crow a car because he wasn’t old enough.
“It was like getting off of a ship and onto a different planet,” Crow said of the Baltimore airport. “I’m like ‘Listen, I literally just spent almost a year leading a platoon of paratroopers at war for this country, and you literally won’t rent me a car because I’m not 25 yet?’”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Once a different company agreed to rent him a car, Crow was driving on the interstate to Fort Bragg for a special training course. He found himself scanning the roads, as well as the rooftops and windows of buildings he drove by. 
“I was just so used to being alert and hyperaware for roadside bombs or snipers or an ambush, and I was just instinctively doing it,” Crow said. “And it just dawned on me that, you know, I had some work to do, basically.”
As the leader of a military platoon, he didn’t have time to think about himself and was more focused on looking after his soldiers, he said. 
“You’re so focused on the missions and taking care of your soldiers and making sure their needs are met,” Crow said. “There’s just constant intensity, right? You’re working 16, 17, 18 hour days, and you’re sleeping three or four hours. You’re cleaning your weapons, you’re getting ready for the next mission. It is such an intense pace.”
Crow’s combat experience would be a crucial factor many years later in a different kind of conflict, this time with the nation’s commander-in-chief.
Last month, Crow, now a member of the U.S. House from Colorado, and five other congressional Democrats addressed members of the military and intelligence community in a public video, saying service members can and must refuse illegal orders from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump responded in social media posts to condemn their words as seditious and punishable by death. He called the Democrats, who each contributed to military or intelligence missions on behalf of their country, traitors. He shared a post calling for them to be hanged. Now they’re the targets of federal investigations.
But what went unacknowledged in the response from Trump, who never served in the military, and what grounded Crow’s message with authority is that Crow, a decorated war hero who has received and issued countless commands on multiple battlefields, understands firsthand the nature of military orders.
The Uniform Code of Military Justice says that service members have the right to refuse orders that violate the U.S. Constitution, U.S. law or military regulations. Though the purpose of the Democrats’ video was to remind troops of that right, the Department of Defense is investigating one them, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, for his involvement, and the FBI has requested interviews with others in the video, including Crow.

Throughout his military career, Crow said he always took “compliance with the law and morality very seriously.” 
When training his platoon of paratroopers before going to Iraq, Crow sat them down in a room and showed them a scene from the 1986 movie “Platoon” depicting the My Lai massacre. The movie is based on real events during the Vietnam War, and the scene showed U.S. soldiers murdering hundreds of civilians.
“I showed that scene to my paratroopers, and then I led a discussion with them about how that happened, and the emotional pressures and the fear and the anxiety and the loss of humanity that led to those actions and into that massacre,” Crow said. “Because I wanted to get them thinking about who they were and how they would respond to those pressures and those tensions. Because I knew that if I waited until we were in the moment, that that would have been too late. You can never train people in the moment, because the fog of war and the intensity is too much. You have to set the conditions.”
That is part of why he and fellow veterans in Congress put out the video on refusing unlawful orders, Crow said, “to start that discussion and start people thinking about what their obligation is.” 
Crow has introduced legislation to increase oversight of civilian casualties in conflict zones. He also cofounded a caucus in the U.S. House centered on protecting civilians. His firsthand experience seeing how conflict affects civilians and witnessing civilian casualties informed that work. 
“That’s why I am so committed to making sure that we train people and we enforce the law of war and the Geneva Conventions and making sure that our young folks know what they can do and shouldn’t do, and never losing sight of themselves,” Crow said. “When you take a unit of young soldiers, most of whom are 18, 19, 20 years old, and most of whom have never left home and you put them into a combat zone and you’re there for months and months and sometimes a year, it’s easy for folks to lose sight of who they are and where they come from.”
From ROTC to the front lines
Crow worked in construction to afford college, and enlisted in the Wisconsin National Guard soon after he started school because it fully covered tuition. He took a semester off for basic training and joined the guard as a private. 
He went to drills one weekend a month and for two weeks in the summer, and that’s where he discovered that he “loved wearing the uniform.”
“I loved having the patch on my shoulder,” Crow said. “I loved being a part of something bigger than myself, a team, and I really for the first time in my life realized how passionate I was about public service and national service and being a part of something bigger than myself.”










He looked at me and he said … ‘Standing outside is your platoon of paratroopers. We're going to war in a couple of months. That's your platoon, train them well, train them hard and don't let us down.’


– U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, about his first commander


The 9/11 terrorist attacks happened during the first week of Crow’s senior year of college. He switched to an active duty contract, and finished college in May 2002 as a distinguished military graduate of the ROTC. That designation meant he got to choose his branch of the military and his assignment, so he selected the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.
Crow went to Fort Benning for infantry school, airborne school and Ranger School, and finished all three before the 2002 holiday season. Ranger School is the Army’s “toughest course,” and hones skills over 62 days “directly related to units whose mission is to engage the enemy in close combat and direct fire battle.”
Crow remembers walking into his commander’s office when he reported to his first assignment in January 2003 and experiencing what he called a “bucket of cold water moment,” when the reality and the gravity of what he signed up for became clear.
“He looked at me and he said … ‘Standing outside is your platoon of paratroopers. We’re going to war in a couple of months. That’s your platoon, train them well, train them hard and don’t let us down.’”
In March, Crow led his platoon of about 50 paratroopers in the invasion of Iraq. They started in Nasiriyah, and then fought in Samawah, which Crow said ended up being a week-long battle, “house to house, street to street.” 
The battle of Samawah was the most intense urban combat the 82nd Airborne Division had experienced since World War II, Crow said. That is where he earned his Bronze Star for leading his platoon in capturing the Highway 8 bridge over the Euphrates River. 
The unit traveled through various other parts of Iraq before moving into Baghdad, where Crow and his platoon spent the rest of 2003 in counterinsurgency and guerrilla warfare.

After spending time back in the U.S. for additional ranger training, Crow went on two tours in Afghanistan in 2004 after he was recruited to join the Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment. The Army’s website says the regiment specializes “in combat missions deep inside enemy territory — a task only the best-trained can carry out in this branch of the elite Special Operations Forces.”
Crow was part of the 75th Ranger Regiment’s Joint Special Operations Task Force assigned to capturing Osama Bin Laden. He spent the year in southeastern Afghanistan along the border with Pakistan fighting the Haqqani Network. 
Now serving on the U.S. House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, Crow, who went on to become a lawyer before seeking elected office, is now tasked with reviewing military actions. After seeing as part of a committee inquiry the full footage of a U.S. strike in September on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, he said he believed a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to boat wreckage was illegal.

(Photo by Tony Leys/KFF Health News)The Trump administration is trying to slash access to lawyers who defend the rights of Americans with disabilities, advocates say.
Most of the lawyers work either for the Department of Justice or for disability rights agencies that Congress set up in every state decades ago. Many of the Justice Department lawyers quit in 2025 after being reassigned to other duties, their supporters say. And Trump budget officials proposed deep cuts to federal grants supporting the state-based legal groups.
People with disabilities have the right to live in their communities if possible. Federal laws and court decisions say they may attend school, work jobs, and go to restaurants, movie theaters, and other public places. If they can find lawyers, they can file legal challenges when those rights are denied.
The federally funded attorneys quietly work to ensure the U.S. lives up to promises made by the Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws, said Alison Barkoff, a health law professor at George Washington University.
“I think many families of people with disabilities, or even many people with disabilities themselves, don’t hear about it until they Google, ‘Where can I get help?’” said Barkoff, who helped lead such efforts under Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.
The attorneys’ goals include ensuring that people with disabilities have the services they need to live in their own homes, instead of having to move into nursing homes or other types of institutions, Barkoff said.
“These are people who, if these supports are ripped away, are going to have to leave their communities and their families, at a higher cost for taxpayers,” she said.
The state-based disability rights groups are known as “protection and advocacy” organizations. Most of them are nonprofit groups.
Congress approved the federally financed system in the 1970s after TV journalist Geraldo Rivera exposed abuses in a New York institution for people with mental and intellectual disabilities, revelations that ignited a national outcry.
President Donald Trump proposed cutting the system’s federal funding from $148 million to $69 million for fiscal year 2026, according to the National Disability Rights Network, which represents the state-based groups.
Appropriations committees in the U.S. House and Senate have recommended Congress maintain funding at the previous level. But advocates for the agencies worry that even if Congress maintains current support, the administration will try again to slash their support in future years. “It definitely would put people in our communities in harm’s way,” said Marlene Sallo, the national network’s executive director.
White House officials declined to comment on why the Trump administration proposed the deep cuts.
Isaac Schreier’s family can attest to the value of the state-based legal groups.
Isaac, 7, lives in Ankeny, Iowa. He has a rare condition called osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease. The condition has caused about 60 bone fractures, including in his limbs, spine, and skull. It can cause intense pain and leave him unable to walk.
At times, Isaac’s disability is practically invisible, said his father, Jake Schreier. Unless he has recently suffered a broken leg bone, he walks well. “But he tires much more quickly than you or I would.”
Isaac’s doctor said he needed a special wheelchair that could be adjusted to put him in different positions depending on which bones were broken. But the private insurer that manages his Medicaid coverage declined to pay for the $3,500 wheelchair. “They required proof that it was a permanent and long-standing condition,” Jake Schreier said. “We were very frustrated.”
Schreier appealed the denial but lost. A nurse at a specialty clinic then recommended he reach out to Disability Rights Iowa, a federally funded protection and advocacy group that had helped other families in similar straits.
The group linked Schreier with two of its attorneys, who filed a new appeal. The lawyers wrote a detailed letter explaining why Isaac was legally entitled to the new wheelchair, and they cited specific Iowa codes and court precedents.
The insurer wound up paying for Isaac’s special wheelchair.
The chair allows Isaac to participate in school and community activities even when he has broken bones. “It’s absolutely night and day. I can’t imagine a world where we didn’t have it,” his father said.
Isaac may again need people like the disability rights lawyers to fight for him, so he won’t be shunted away from society, Schreier said. “We’re really trying to keep as many doors open as possible for him.”
The threat to the state-based groups’ funding comes as the Trump administration seeks to force more people with mental illness or addictions into institutions.
David Hutt, deputy executive director for legal services at the National Disability Rights Network, noted that the groups have legal authority to go into facilities where people with disabilities live, to check conditions and treatment. Those facilities include state institutions and privately owned nursing homes.
More Americans could wind up living in such settings if Trump succeeds in his quest to institutionalize people with mental illness who are living on the streets, Hutt said.
At the same time, states are facing cuts in federal contributions to Medicaid, the public health coverage program for people with low incomes or disabilities. In response, they may be tempted to reduce Medicaid coverage of community care programs, many of which are considered optional under federal law, Hutt said. If that happens, “you’re going to get increased institutionalization, which actually costs more,” he said.
Disability rights organizations often have stepped in when states failed to provide care and services that people with disabilities are entitled to. So have lawyers from the Justice Department’s civil rights division.
For example, Disability Rights Iowa filed a lawsuit in 2023 alleging the state failed to provide proper mental health resources for children on the Medicaid program. The state agreed to a settlement that advocates said could bring “radical change” to the system.
In 2021, the Justice Department warned Iowa officials that their lack of support for community services meant too many people with intellectual disabilities had to live in facilities. State officials vowed to do better.
Since Trump returned to office, many of the Justice Department’s most experienced disability rights lawyers have taken buyouts or been reassigned to other areas, said Jennifer Mathis, a former top administrator at the Justice Department under Biden. “There’s really skeleton staffing at this point,” said Mathis, now deputy director of the Bazelon Center, which advocates for rights of people with mental disabilities.
The overall civil rights division is down to about 300 people, fewer than half the number it had under Biden, Mathis said.
The civil rights division’s new director, Harmeet Dhillon, told conservative commentator Glenn Beck in April that more than 100 attorneys had left the division, but that they didn’t support Trump’s priorities. “The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws, not woke ideology,” she told Beck.
In a statement to KFF Health News, Dhillon said the division continues to be “a vocal and active advocate for Americans with disabilities.”
Dhillon noted the department recently sued Uber over complaints that the ride-hailing service was turning away customers with service dogs or wheelchairs; has secured agreements with Arkansas and North Carolina to improve treatment of imprisoned people with disabilities; and is investigating large bus companies over allegations of failing to provide proper accommodations for people with disabilities.
The department declined to comment on the record about the number of attorneys it has working on disability rights issues. However, it is publicly recruiting “civil rights warriors,” including lawyers, to join the civil rights division.
Jake Schreier, the Iowa parent, hopes the issue will be worked out nationally. “I really can’t believe this is anything that would be partisan,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — In the year to come, Kentucky Treasurer Mark Metcalf hopes to expand and streamline services in his office that return unclaimed property to Kentuckians. 
Metcalf said in a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern that his office has returned about $80.5 million in unclaimed property since he took office at the start of 2024.
Unclaimed property can take a variety of forms, like paychecks or refunds for insurance or utilities. Metcalf recalled one story of a family living in Austin, Texas, being reconnected with a dormant estate of a deceased relative who lived in Kentucky. The family was unaware of $1.7 million in the account for three years. 
“We called the family in Austin and said there’s $1.7 million which was not accounted for when the estate was opened,” Metcalf said.
The treasurer’s office tries to make the process to search for unclaimed property “as user-friendly as possible,” Metcalf said. Kentuckians who want to check if they have any property in the system can go to the treasurer’s website, treasury.ky.gov, and click on “Unclaimed Property” in the menu at the top of the page. Then, they may fill out the search with their information to see if the database has any matches. If they do have a match, then they will be directed to begin the process to reclaim the money. 
People can also make nationwide searches for unclaimed property at missingmoney.com. 
“It’s their money. We intend to get it back,” Metcalf said. “It is public money in the sense that it’s being managed by us for the public good, but all of these monies that you see in the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund are monies that belong to someone.” 
The office is in the first phases of a pilot program to add child support and crime victims’ restitution payments to the system, Metcalf said. Those pilot programs will likely last a year or so before it can be fully implemented. 
Metcalf, a Republican who is halfway through his first term as state treasurer, told the Lantern he plans to run for reelection in 2027. 
“It’s a great job,” he added. “Serving the people of the commonwealth is the greatest honor extended to me, and we don’t take for granted what we’re doing.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5491-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-31 06:11:40.590436

(Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)New Year’s Eve events across Pennsylvania have gained a reputation for the unique, bizarre and creative objects raised or dropped as part of the celebration. Many are tied to host communities’ identities  – through connections to business, industry, traditions or the name of their town. 
One community in Montgomery County has plans to join in the festivities this New Year’s Eve by marking the holiday with an inaugural hat drop, a nod to the profession of one of the borough’s founding residents. 
A  6-feet-tall, 200-pound metal top hat strewn with white lights will descend from a fire ladder in Hatboro at 6 p.m. tonight as part of a family-friendly fete, according to borough manager Diane Hegele. 
“We saw the PEEP drop and the Hershey’s kiss drop and thought it would be neat to do a hat drop,” Hegele said. “Our fire marshal happened to be out doing an inspection at Royson Engineering and happened to see they had a laser printer and asked if they’d be interested in making a hat. And they did. They did a phenomenal job.”

Here are some highlights of the dozens of similar celebrations in the commonwealth’s cities, boroughs and townships:
In Perry County, Duncannon will revive its sled drop today after skipping last year. Wilkes-Barre Township, Luzerne County, will bring back its blueberry after three years – a locally crafted five-feet-diameter glowing aluminum orb draped in blue, according to its fire department. And after a near-miss, a wrench will again descend in Mechanicsburg, Cumberland County – thanks to volunteers stepping in to help as the longtime organizer recovers from surgery, as PennLive reported. 
Other changes to the lineup include Red Lion in York County and Chambersburg in Franklin County foregoing their traditions for 2025.

Red Lion’s Municipal Utility Authority employees had volunteered in past years to scramble up to the roof to raise a cigar in honor of the industry’s legacy in the borough; however, liability concerns arose with fewer people available for that this year, according to board member Nevin Horne. 
Developer Jordan Ilyes hopes to integrate the totem into a celebration at one of his properties. His Franklin Street Social, Horne noted, offers a quieter section of the borough that would be safer for spectators and less disruptive to traffic than the intersection of Route 24 and Main Street for past cigar-raising ceremonies.
It’s also unclear whether the Martin’s potato chip drop bag could be restarted in Chambersburg in the future. However, chips will fall more than 100 miles away in Lewistown, Mifflin County, in honor of the Hartley’s variety produced locally after skipping several years.
Pottsville will raise a giant replica of a bottle of Yuengling lager, the well-known brewery has confirmed. 
In Allentown, a 20-feet-wide hockey puck drops at the PPL Center – home of event sponsor the Lehigh Valley Phantoms American Hockey League team. 
A mammoth PEEPS chick descends as part of an entire festival based around the sugar-dusted Easter confection produced in Bethlehem. And a 300-pound aluminum kiss is dropped in Hershey — home to the world famous chocolate-maker the Hershey Company.
There’s also a pickle in Dillsburg York County, a huckleberry in New Bloomfield, Perry County, and bologna in Lebanon – a 28-year tradition that’s previously sparked requests from animal rights advocates to celebrate with a vegan version. 
Shippensburg has dropped an anchor for nearly as long – even though the borough (which extends into both Cumberland and Franklin counties) derives its name from a founding resident and not from any strong maritime ties. 
Several communities will continue their long-standing traditions of dropping locally significant emblems. 
In Northumberland County, Shamokin has – for at least a decade, according to city manager Robert Slaby – been lowering a giant, glittering piece of coal for the industry that looms so large in the region’s history and its identity, even if it may be well past its heyday. Sunbury drops an oversized version of a lightbulb – a reference to the city’s streets being the first illuminated by overhead conductors. 
The Haines shoe house replica dropped in Hellam Township pays homage to the York County municipality’s singular promotional structure turned Airbnb rental.
The cities of York and Lancaster have been celebrating with white and red roses, respectively, for years – in honor of their nicknames. 
It’s the 13th annual mushroom drop in Kennett Square, the Chester County community known as the “mushroom capital of the world.”
Harrisburg’s strawberry drop dates back to 1991. 
And just down the Susquehanna River from the capital city, the York County community of Goldsboro will again drop a nuclear ball opposite Three Mile Island – site of the nation’s worst nuclear disaster more than 40 years ago and scheduled to reopen in 2027 to power Microsoft data centers.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hbgstrawberrydrop-1024x768.png,,,2025-12-31 06:11:40.590436

The state’s complicated relationship with change — at times an embrace, at others an aversion — was certainly tested in the past year. Transformation was felt locally as powers shifted near and far, with the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s second term unfurling in new ways. The Ocean State contributed set pieces to this national diorama, especially the U.S. district courthouse in Providence, where numerous lawsuits against the feds outlined blue states’ more activist approach to Trump’s administration the second time around.
In Rhode Island Current’s first story of 2025, “silence” is how General Assembly leadership described advocates’ and lobbyists’ asks ahead of the then-upcoming legislative session. Money, everyone deduced, would be an issue this year, and it was. Funding woes, whether originating from state or federal coffers, were an outsized theme in the past 12 months’ coverage.   
But what began in quiet ended with volume turned way up. Here are the stories that reverberated loudest in 2025.

1. A tragedy at year’s end in Providence
For six days in December, the nation followed Providence as the capital city reckoned with a shooting at Brown University on Dec. 13 that injured nine and killed two teenaged students, Ella Cook, 19, and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, 18.    
The now-deceased suspect was Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a former Brown graduate student who studied physics in the Barus and Holley building in the early 2000s. Returning more than two decades after he dropped out of the Ivy League school, Neves Valente sprayed more than 40 9 mm bullets into a classroom before escaping.
The wanton violence immediately unsettled Providence. The night of the shooting, the city’s residents received texts or calls from loved ones wondering if they were OK. The uncertainty abated when a person of interest was identified the next morning. But the uncertainty returned later that day when investigators announced they had the wrong man.
It took several days to ascertain the killer’s true identity, biography and location. As the multi-day manhunt unwound on national television, Providence’s cast of local politicians was catapulted into a much larger, brighter and harsher spotlight than usual. Each night, reporters from other states and nations streamed into the city’s  Public Safety Complex to ask questions of the Providence police, Mayor Brett Smiley and the FBI. And each night, the Ocean State’s caravan of reporters was there, too, asking questions of familiar faces in this unfamiliar context.
During a press briefing on Dec. 18 that began more than five hours after its originally scheduled start time, investigators revealed that they now believed Neves Valente also killed his former classmate and MIT professor Nuno Loureiro on Dec. 16. Neves Valente then went to a New Hampshire storage unit and killed himself, which is where law enforcement found his body on Dec. 18. 
One string that helped investigators tie everything together: A witness publicly identified only as John, whose post to the subreddit r/Providence, plus his subsequent interview with police, unlocked the make and model of rental car Neves Valente drove on the day of the shooting.    
The national crowds have since left Rhode Island’s capital, while the city and state reckon with the tragedy. Brown has temporarily placed its top public safety official on leave as the school embarks on multiple internal investigations into the incident and overall campus safety. Mayor Smiley, meanwhile, has implored the FBI to give the semi-anonymous John the $50,000 the agency promised for finding the perpetrator.

2. “One Big Beautiful Bill” weighs heavy on local government 
The sweeping set of federal budget cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by Trump on July 4, set off not-so-celebratory fireworks in Rhode Island. Democratic elected officials, both state and federal, quickly condemned the move to restrict social safety net programs, including health care and food assistance, from the most vulnerable residents. 
A trio of state-commissioned reports issued in late October analyzing the local impacts of the federal rescission package further fueled their fury. Major changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will leave hundreds of thousands of low-income residents, seniors, lawful immigrants and others without access to affordable health care, money for groceries — or both. 
The implications extend not only to those directly affected by cuts to food assistance, Medicaid or Affordable Care Act insurance, with rippling consequences for the state’s fragile health care system, food retailers and the broader economy.
Top-of-mind for lawmakers heading into the 2026 legislative session: the cost to carry out these massive program rewrites, which demands major investments in IT and personnel while shrinking the federal funds available to states to administer the programs. Even though cuts to Medicaid and SNAP don’t start for at least another year, legislators and budget analysts want to start investing now to avoid hefty penalties later.
Meanwhile, federal discounts for people who buy insurance through the state health exchange are slated to expire on Dec. 31, forcing more than one-quarter of the 48,000 enrollees to drop coverage, with corresponding cuts to federal funding, according to analysis by HealthSource RI.
All this as state tax rolls are poised to shrink by $79 million in 2026 under federal tax policies that expand business deductions for research and development, among other pro-business tax cuts.

3. Major headwinds for Revolution Wind
Rhode Island’s signature offshore wind project faced a second major blow just before Christmas, when federal regulators halted leases to five East Coast offshore wind projects, including the nearly completed Revolution Wind project.
It’s a reprise of a similarly unexpected setback that occurred in mid-August, when federal regulators ordered developers of the project to halt construction citing national security concerns. The stop-work order was met with instant backlash from labor leaders, environmental advocates and elected officials who decried the consequences for the 1,000 union jobs, state decarbonization mandates and regional grid reliability. The project was already 80% complete, with 40 of 65 turbines fully built south of the state coastline, and was set to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026.
A pair of lawsuits, one led by Democratic state attorneys general and the second by project developers, forced a temporary resolution, with a federal judge in D.C. forcing the Trump administration to back off on Sept. 22. Unlike other litigious situations between states and companies and the federal government, the order was never appealed.
Trump’s anti-wind sentiment blew back upon the Ocean State on Dec. 22, with a new pause imposed on the 704-megawatt project, and four others. Neronha said his office was reviewing the suspension order, noting that multiple federal judges have refuted Trump’s ability to interfere in offshore wind projects already fully permitted and under construction — both generally and in the specific case of Revolution Wind.
Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, said in a statement on Dec. 22 that it was “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” including potential legal proceedings and communication with federal regulatory agencies.

4. Chaos, confusion and hunger pangs mark record federal shutdown
The 43-day government shutdown felt like an eternity: for lawmakers, for travelers, for furloughed federal workers and most of all, for the 145,000 Rhode Islanders who receive federal food assistance.
The abrupt loss of benefits for the millions of people nationwide who depend on the SNAP to feed themselves and their families cast new urgency on the congressional inaction when monthly benefits failed to come through at the start of November, one month into the shutdown.
Food pantries were inundated with new and returning customers, while nonprofit and state leaders struggled to fill the $29 million monthly hole in a program dependent on federal funds.
Gov. Dan McKee devised a short-term workaround repurposing alternative federal funds, which offered partial relief to less than half of Rhode Island SNAP recipients. 
But like many fights between states and the Trump administration over the last year, it took legal action to force resolution. A pair of lawsuits filed in late October by Democratic state attorneys general and separately, a consortium of nonprofit and religious groups, sought to force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pay November benefits. The legal action led to a chaotic and confusing tug-of-war between plaintiffs, federal judges — including Rhode Island’s own Chief Judge John J. McConnell — and the Trump administration over whether, when and how much of regular SNAP benefits must be paid out to states. 
By Nov. 6, under McConnell’s order, the state began transferring money to the special debit cards used by SNAP recipients for monthly groceries. A series of appeals by the Trump administration extended beyond the Nov. 12 reopening of the federal government, but were ultimately dismissed in early December.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)
5. Roger Williams and Fatima hospitals on edge 
State regulators gave conditional approval to sell Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to new owners in June 2024. Eighteen months later, the fate of the safety net hospital remains uncertain, with closure looming if buyer The Centurion Foundation can’t secure investor-backed financing to cement the purchase from bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings.
The delays have created anguish among the 2,700 employees and many more patients, including people on public health care, who rely on the facilities’ emergency rooms and specialty mental health, surgical and cancer treatment services. 
Even Chief U.S. Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, where Prospect’s bankruptcy case is playing out, has expressed empathy for the state’s already fragile health care system.
Yet the waiting game continues.
With alternative suitor Prime Health Care no longer interested — at least for now — the fate of the languishing facilities rests solely on Centurion and its pledge to close the deal by Jan. 15. But preparing for the worst, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has already come up with a plan B in the form of a state-appointed receivership, though details remain elusive. 
State lawmakers, quick to point out the importance of the community hospitals, have not come forward with alternative remedies, such as budget funds, to keep the facilities afloat, either.

6. The Attorney General vs. the President
With the federal government under full Republican control, much of the opposition to President Donald Trump’s second-term agenda has fallen to a coalition of Democratic attorneys general who have filed lawsuits against the administration on an almost weekly basis. 
It was a particularly litigious year for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who co-led many of these efforts. His office joined 46 cases against the commander-in-chief this year, one of which was dropped.
Not even the holidays were entirely set aside. The AG’s office announced in a Christmas Eve email that Neronha had joined a multistate lawsuit on Dec. 23 challenging recent federal attempts to limit gender-affirming care for minors.  
In fact, Neronha has joined so many multistate challenges that his office’s website had to include a page titled “Federal Action Response” to track each case against the Trump administration. Complaints challenged funding freezes for education, infrastructure, and compensating victims of violent crimes.
Neronha’s office has similarly fought against policy directives redirecting housing grants, attempts to fire federal workers, and Trump’s executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants.
Of the 46 cases filed, 13 landed before judges in the U.S. District Court in Providence, which has become one of the key legal battlegrounds for Neronha’s coalition against the Trump administration as judges have repeatedly ruled against the federal government’s actions.
While mostly on the attack, Neronha’s office also serves as the primary legal defense for Secretary of State Gregg Amore, who was sued by the Department of Justice in December for declining to provide the federal government Rhode Island’s personal voter information.

7. A summer of discontent at Butler Hospital
In a year laden with labor stories, the tale of Butler Hospital stands out. An April informational picket by the psychiatric hospital’s nursing, medical, support, custodial and culinary staff — about 720 members in all who belonged to SEIU 1199NE — provided the initial rumblings that eventually shook into a full walkout that lasted from mid-May to mid-August. It was purportedly the longest hospital worker strike in Rhode Island history. 
Workers cited increasing incidents of workplace violence between staff and inpatients, wages inadequate for the local cost of living, and management unresponsive to worker needs. The hospital leadership at Care New England countered that workers’ demands were excessively costly, that safety was always a priority, and that negotiations stalled because of the union’s bargaining tactics.
Negotiations played out, partially in public, for three months. As the legislative session wrapped up partway through the strike, the picket continued into the summer heat, and each day there were handmade signs, honking cars and chanting parades of workers outside the hospital campus’ entrance on Blackstone Boulevard. When the parties did meet at the bargaining table, contract negotiations frequently proceeded in circuitous or unproductive ways. 
Butler closed about half of its 197 beds during the course of the strike, slashing its capacity. It also hired an outside PR firm to handle communications as the public back-and-forth got increasingly nasty, cut worker benefits like health coverage, rebuffed the state labor department’s lockout claims, and spent millions on replacement laborers. 
Then, on Aug. 18, about 99% of members who voted approved a new four-year contract, one with a $20-per-hour wage floor plus health and retirement benefits preserved. A new time bank would help workers injured at work to avoid income gaps. Care New England moved quickly to restore the shuttered units to operating status. And coming out slightly on top of it all, at least in terms of reputation, was Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, whom union leaders credited with helping to seal the strike’s final negotiations.

8. ‘Tis the season for elections 
the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary. But the competition, and the public criticisms, heated up in 2025 as the renewed rivals pointed fingers back and forth over the Washington Bridge, the opioid epidemic, the loss of Hasbro Inc., and the fallout from the Trump administration. 
Preliminary polling suggests Foulkes, a former CVS executive, might have an edge on the sitting governor this time around, with McKee still dogged by low approval ratings often linked to public dissatisfaction over his handling of the Washington Bridge. But most voters, unlike candidates, aren’t thinking about the elections yet.
The 2026 gubernatorial field also features a trio of Republican candidates, including former Gov. Don Carcieri aide Aaron Guckian jumping in on a “compassionate conservatism” platform. Meanwhile Neronha, another big Democratic name in rumor circles, decided against running after a year fueled by federal lawsuits and health care crises.
The biggest question mark remains House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who has maintained a sizable lead in his campaign finance account but not yet confirmed (nor denied) whether he will seek the governor’s seat. Shekarchi expects to make an announcement in the first quarter of the year.
Other races to watch this year: the battle for the attorney general’s position, left open because Neronha is term-limited. One Democratic contender, State Rep. Rob Craven of North Kingstown, entered and just as quickly dropped out of the race amid public reporting about past domestic violence allegations. Three other Democrats are vying for the job: Kim Ahern, most recently chairperson of the Cannabis Control Commission; Rep. Jason Knight of Barrington; and Keith Hoffmann, who worked as chief of policy and senior counsel under Neronha.
Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos also faces three challengers so far: Democrats Cindy Coyne, a former state senator from Barrington; Providence City Councilor Sue AnderBois; and Republican John Loughlin, a former state representative.

9. Shakeups in Senate leadership 
Quiet tensions in the Rhode Island Senate rose to the surface in fall 2024 under a public feud between then-Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and his second-in-command, Ryan Pearson. The feud didn’t die with the leadership battle, instead intensifying in the wake of Ruggerio’s death in April. A second, contentious round of leadership elections again pitted conservative and progressive factions of Senate Democrats against each other, leading to the ascension of Sen. Valarie Lawson and Sen. Frank Ciccone as the new president and majority leader, respectively.
Ciccone, a federal firearms dealer who voted against expanding abortion access and state environmental mandates, seemed an unlikely teammate for Lawson, who has championed abortion rights and gun restrictions.
And the eleventh hour revisions to the assault weapons ban bill — narrowing the scope of classified weapons and eliminating a registration system — showcased Ciccone’s influence over state policy.  Lawson, for her part, denied a procedural move by fellow Senate Democrat and friend Pam Lauria to reroute the original, stricter legislation through a more left-leaning panel, ruling Lauria “out of order” in an exchange that seemed to bely Lawson’s historic support for gun safety.
The stripped-down bill was ultimately passed by both chambers on the final day of the legislative session.
Ciccone’s strong support for Bally’s Corp. also diluted the end to smoking in the Tiverton and Lincoln casinos. Rather than a comprehensive and immediate smoking ban, the legislature adopted a more measured approach that delays implementation and exempts dedicated “smoking lounges” from going smoke-free. Casino workers initially pledged to continue fighting for a healthier workplace in the 2026 legislative session, but their enthusiasm has since waned.

10. (Tie) The Washington Bridge saga continues
After dominating headlines throughout 2024, it was a mostly quiet year for the Washington Bridge. Even Gov. Dan McKee’s Dec. 5 declaration that demolition of the shuttered westbound highway was complete ahead of schedule was met with crickets from many business owners and residents of East Providence, the epicenter of a commuter crisis that began two years ago.
There was some concern over ongoing demolition work in January after video caught debris falling into the Seekonk River near Providence, but transportation officials insisted all was going according to plan.
The bulk of Rhode Islanders’ outrage came in late September when an Instagram poster published excerpts of a long-awaited forensic analysis of what led to the bridge’s failure — a report McKee had promised to make public in 2024, but decided to hold out of the public eye amid the state’s lawsuit against the 13 firms that performed work on the bridge.
Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. was the one member of McKee’s administration to sit in the hot seat before lawmakers to finally answer questions about what his department and officials knew about the bridge’s condition leading up to its closure. Under tough questioning from former U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha, Alviti said the blame fell almost squarely on the contractors hired to maintain the bridge, but he also defended the state’s reliance on outsourcing.

10. (Tie) RIPTA continues to run on fumes
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) looked like it had managed to reverse course after years of navigating bumpy roads to maintain service. But this year did not see the same level of relief given to the cash-strapped bus agency, resulting in the most significant service reductions in its 59-year history.
In January, Gov. Dan McKee’s recommended fiscal 2026 state budget left a $32.6 million hole in RIPTA’s budget. McKee and legislative leaders had ordered RIPTA to finish an efficiency study to recommend ways to reduce costs by March 1. But the board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase in the state’s gas tax and upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account. RIPTA administrators reduced the shortfall to $10 million after identifying an additional $8 million in savings from a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. 
It still wasn’t enough to prevent the agency from enacting sweeping service reductions impacting 46 of its 67 routes. RIPTA’s CEO recently told the agency’s board that some routes have started to see service return, mostly in southern Rhode Island.
RIPTA enters the upcoming budget season with a nearly $14 million deficit. Agency leaders are hopeful either McKee or other state leaders will fill that remaining gap by the time the next fiscal year begins in July.

That set the tone for an action-packed year that included the election of the first woman governor in the state’s history, a surprise redistricting push, major federal policy shifts that led to upheavals in education and health care here, fallout from ramped up immigration enforcement across the commonwealth, statewide protests against the presidential administration, the creation of a new rate class for data centers as the state grapples with skyrocketing energy demands and much more.
The Virginia Mercury chronicled it all, publishing over 600 stories this year. Here are the top 10 most-read reports and columns of 2025.

Local, state and federal leaders recently broke ground on Chesapeake’s first-ever public pool, an event more than a half-century in the making. The $27 million Cuffee Aquatics Center, set to open in late 2027, will be an expansion of the existing community center at the site, and the 28,628-square-foot indoor complex will include 25-yard lanes for competitive swimming, diving boards, and a therapeutic pool.
Public pools provide opportunities for people of all races and income levels to learn how to swim, prevent drowning, and acquire a skill that will last a lifetime. That the commonwealth’s second-largest city(population 253,000 today) resisted this practical amenity for so long has been stupefying. | Read more

(Stock photo by Getty Images)Fifteen Virginia health centers on Tuesday announced they are suing the state government, claiming it has violated state and federal law through underpayments on Medicaid reimbursements. 
The collection of medical providers are designated as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), a type of nonprofit health clinics that are federally funded. They provide primary care services regardless of people’s ability to pay and paid services are offered on a sliding scale. 
FQHCs are a go-to health care source for people insured through Medicaid, and FQHCs are reimbursed through the state-federal joint program for certain expenditures. 
In a suit filed in federal court, the plaintiffs allege that the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) has violated state and federal law through years of under-reimbursement. The suit alleges that for 25 years, DMAS has paid less than the average cost per visit for services the health centers provide to Medicaid patients, which has eaten into the FQHCs’ other sources of funding. 
Brian Harris, CEO of the Greater Prince William Community Health Center, said that the coalition has spent the past four years attempting to resolve the matter with state policy makers out of court. The Northern Virginia FQHC is among the 15 from around the state involved in the filing. 
“We’ve exhausted every other option before coming to this point,” he said. “Legal action is now necessary to protect the long term viability of FQHCs in Virginia and the patients who rely on us.” 
In their suit, the plaintiffs argue that DMAS has set arbitrary payments when calculating the prospective payment system (PPS). This is when Medicaid pays health care providers a predetermined amount for services, rather than an itemized amount based on individual services provided.
The suit claims that DMAS has “systematically understated the statutorily mandated PPS rate.”
Virginia’s group of FQHCs aren’t the first cohort of centers to sue their state government over the matter — Connecticut health centers did the same earlier this year. A similar 2023 case in Florida saw the court side with the FQHCs. 
Harris and other CEOs of fellow health centers in Virginia’s suit said in a press call Tuesday that FQHCs are “safety net” providers that often operate in areas where they are either the only affordable or only local health care option. 
As the centers become financially strained, patients can face longer waitlists for appointments, reduced clinic hours or types of services, or risk of closure to some clinics. Harris also emphasized that local clinics offer not only health care but are also employers, so loss of services or clinics overall is an effect on local jobs and economies, too.
Virginia hospitals, clinics brace for federal health care changes

Ted Waters, who is providing legal counsel on the suit, noted that it comes at a time where providers are already bracing for financial losses as thousands of VIrignians are at risk of losing Medicaid coverage. 
A reconciliation bill that Congress passed last summer entails forthcoming changes to Medicaid eligibility that is projected to make thousands of Virginians and millions nationwide vulnerable to losing health insurance. President Donald Trump backed the measure. 
FQHCs and free clinics are bracing for a surge of uninsured patients flocking to them for more free or reduced-cost care. 
Since some uninsured people are more likely to put off preventative care until crises arise, hospitals suspect their emergency departments could also see surges — a probability that may  cause hospitals to experience losses that are likely to be passed onto consumers more broadly as hospitals negotiate with private insurers. 
“What is already a crisis is going to be exacerbated,” Waters said. 
With their suit filed, he added that the groups hope their case can “fix the issue (of low reimbursement rates) going forward.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles is rolling out a new online grant application system ahead of its annual highway safety funding cycle, a move officials say will simplify and modernize how hundreds of safety-focused projects are reviewed and funded each year.
Beginning in February, applicants seeking federal highway safety grants administered by the DMV’s Highway Safety Office will use a new digital platform called eGrants, which replaces what the agency described as a largely manual, paper-heavy process. The application window will run from Feb. 1 through Feb. 28, 2026.
Each year, Virginia DMV awards millions of dollars in federal highway safety funds to organizations working to reduce traffic deaths, injuries and crashes across the commonwealth. 
Grants start at $5,000, and DMV is inviting a wide range of Virginia-based organizations to apply, including law enforcement agencies, nonprofit groups, state and local government agencies, and colleges and universities.
“With eGrants, applying for funding will now be faster, simpler, and easier for applicants across the commonwealth,” the agency said in a statement announcing the new system on Tuesday.
DMV officials said they are particularly interested in proposals that bring new or creative approaches to traffic safety, while continuing proven strategies that have helped save lives on Virginia roads. 
Over the years, grant funding has supported a broad mix of education, enforcement and community-based initiatives.
Among past projects cited by the agency are a campaign at Norfolk State University that featured student-athletes creating videos urging classmates and fans to drive safely; an artist-led contest sponsored by the city of Roanoke to design highly visible pedestrian safety messages displayed around the city; and specialized law enforcement task forces, including in Fairfax County, focused on keeping impaired drivers off the road.
The new eGrants platform is intended to make it easier both for applicants and for DMV staff who oversee the program. 
According to the agency, the portal allows users to upload required materials electronically, track the status of their applications in real time, and reduce errors that can delay approval or reimbursement. 
The system also centralizes records and project reporting, which DMV said will help staff manage and review roughly 350 grants each year and close out projects more efficiently.
To be eligible for funding, applicants must propose programs with measurable objectives that allow the state to evaluate whether a project is effective. 
In addition, applicants are required to complete a grant application training course scheduled to take place in January 2026. DMV said prospective applicants should contact the program manager assigned to their area for details about the required training. 
Funding decisions will be based on the potential impact of proposed projects, with an emphasis on efforts that promote the safety of Virginians of all backgrounds. 
Approved projects will be funded on a cost-reimbursement basis, with the funding period running from Oct. 1, 2026, through Sept. 30, 2027.
When the application period opens in February, applicants will be able to submit proposals entirely online using the new system. DMV said the launch of eGrants is part of a broader effort to improve how the agency delivers services to both customers and employees.
“The launch of eGrants reflects DMV’s ongoing commitment to enhancing services for customers and employees,” the agency said.
Additional information, including application forms, program guidelines, required training and evaluation measures, will be available on the DMV’s website. 
Applicants may also contact their regional DMV program manager for assistance or questions related to the grant process.

It’s an event hosted by Feeding Georgia, which is a network of regional food banks, in collaboration with the Georgia Department of Agriculture. This gathering has been a tradition for six decades and the proceeds go toward addressing food insecurity in the state. 
Jan. 12: The Georgia General Assembly gavels into session for 2026. The first task may seem like a mundane one but it will be big news for Gold Dome dwellers: Setting the official legislative meeting schedule, including when everyone’s favorite day – sine die, or the last day of the session – will fall on the calendar. 
Jan. 14: Members of the business community will gather bright and early at Mercedes-Benz Stadium to hear from Gov. Brian Kemp and legislative leaders for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s annual Eggs and Issues event. The speeches often provide a sneak peek of the top power players’ legislative agenda. 
Jan. 15: Georgians for a Healthy Future hold their policy-packed Health Care Unscrambled event at the Georgia Freight Depot. This year, the keynote speaker is Katie Keith, who is the founding director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Tickets are available here. 
Jan. 21: It’s maternal health awareness day at the Capitol, organized by Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies. 
Jan. 23: The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute will hold its annual Insights conference, which will feature analysis of the new state budget proposals and how changing federal policies will impact Georgia.
Jan. 28: People in recovery and their allies will rally at the Georgia Freight Depot and state Capitol for addiction recovery awareness day, brought to you by the Georgia Council for Recovery. 
Jan. 29: Is a storm a brewin’ or is that the sound of parents and their children, caregivers and advocates coming to the state Capitol to promote kid-friendly policies? Strolling Thunder, which is organized by GEEARS, is all about urging Georgia’s leaders to think of the children.

(Photo by LaMar Price)
NEW ORLEANS – The similarities of these two Sugar Bowl head coaches are many. Georgia football coach Kirby Smart’s dad was a high school football coach. So is Ole Miss coach Pete Golding’s daddy.
Smart played defensive back, safety to be exact. So did Golding.
When both Smart and Golding finished their playing days, they hired on as graduate assistant coaches at their alma maters.
Rick Cleveland
Following those apprenticeships both Smart and Golding cut their coaching teeth in the Division II Gulf South Conference, Kirby at Valdosta State and Pete at his alma mater, Delta State.
Smart worked as a defensive coordinator for Nick “He of Seven National Championships” Saban at Alabama. So did Golding.
In this age of high powered, spread-the-field offenses when most head coaches worked first as assistant coaches on that side of the ball, both Smart and Golding rose through the coaching ranks on the defensive side. 
Both Smart, 50, and Golding, 41, are sons of the South and speak with decidedly Southern accents. Both tend to become very animated when they talk.
And that’s where similarities pretty much end. Smart has won 117 games and two national championships. Golding has won one game, period.
The Ole Miss hope – some would say, the Ole Miss dream – is that Golding can produce anywhere near similar success in Oxford, Mississippi, as Smart has in Athens, Georgia. And, yes, those similar backgrounds are part of what Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter had in mind when he  promoted Golding to head coach on Nov. 30 after Lane Kiffin flew the Ole Miss coop.
“Similar backgrounds, similar pedigree, no doubt about it,” Carter said. “Their journey has been very similar. Man, we’d love to have some of that same success Georgia has had.”
Of course, they would. That would mean four SEC Championships and two national titles over the next decade.
But Carter had far more than that in mind when he elevated Golding, as he explained Tuesday: “I just think Pete is uniquely fit for Ole Miss. I think that’s what I have learned over the last three years. Man, Pete Golding loves Ole Miss. His family loves this place. … When you see him in that building and you hear him around the players and the respect they have for him, all those things are great. The fact that he wants to build something really special here at Ole Miss. That makes a ton of difference, too.”
That his career path mirrors that of Smart is far from lost on Golding. Where Smart is concerned, Golding has been a long-time fan, going back to Golding’s first year as a graduate coach at Delta State. Smart was then Saban’s defensive coordinator at Alabama helping win national championships.
“I remember studying their tape, trying to figure out what they were doing and how we could increase our package and do it better,” Golding said. “I was coaching in DII in the Gulf South Conference, and I appreciated that Coach Smart had been at Valdosta State. It was a respect factor based on where he had come from and how he did it. And then, obviously, I worked with a lot of guys who worked with him, so that I felt I knew him better than I really did.”
That respect, Smart said Tuesday, is mutual.
“Pete worked his way up through the ranks, very similar to how I did,” Smart said. “He’s coached under sone really good coaches, been part of of some really good defensive staffs. … I don’t know Pete that well, I just know him through other people. I’m happy for him. I’m happy when someone that works as hard as he did and worked his way up and dedicated himself to being a position coach, a coordinator and then a head coach. That’s the way it is supposed to be. That’s the way it is supposed to go if you’re able to do it. He’s done it.”

Listen to Smart and Golding and you get a sense that, regardless of how little they know one another, they are part of a fraternity of defense-minded coaches. They clearly take great pride in having built their careers on that side of the ball. They are from the school of football thought that while offense sells tickets, defense wins championships. Golding says its only natural that defensive coaches pull for each other. He remembers thinking earlier in his career that all the head coaching jobs were going to the latest hot-shot offensive coordinators.
“I think any time you are a defensive coach and you see a defensive coach get a head job, you pull for him,” Golding said. “You want him to have success and create more opportunities for defensive guys to become head coaches. I don’t know about a fraternity but I do think we kind of pull for each other.”
While the mutual admiration society will take about a four-hour break on the first night of 2026, the guess here is that the shared respect will extend far beyond.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/30171305/Pete-Golding.jpg,,,2025-12-31 05:11:42.504540

NEW ORLEANS – Notes and quotes from the Sugar Bowl:
The biggest news of Sugar Bowl Media Day Tuesday was splendid news for Ole Miss football fans.
All American running back Kewan Lacy pronounced himself “ready to go” for Thursday’s Sugar Bowl match with Georgia, and his coach, Pete Golding, confirmed Lacy’s status, saying, “I couldn’t agree with him more!”
“I am excited to watch (Lacy) got out and play and play really well,” Golding said.
Lacy has been one of the nation’s top rushers all season long for the 12-1 Rebels, running for 1,366 yards and 21 touchdowns on 273 carries. He suffered a shoulder injury in the Rebels’ first-round playoff victory over Tulane, which he called “just a little stinger in my AC joint.”
Georgia held Lacy to a season low 31 yards on 12 carries in the Bulldogs’ 43-35 victory at Athens, Georgia, on Oct. 18. Lacy did score two touchdowns, but Georgia, which never punted, came from behind in the fourth quarter to hand the Rebels theirs only regular season defeat.
Asked to compare Georgia’s defense with others he has faced, Lacy said, “Yeah. I’ll just say, they have more, bigger people.”
“But it’s football at the end of the day and it’s not about size,” Lacy said. “It’s about doing our job. I just feel like if we just go out and do our job, it’s going to be a great outcome.”
***
Meanwhile, Georgia’s injury report was mixed. The Bulldogs will be without starting defensive end Gabe Harris, who suffers from a painful turf toe injury. But Georgia will welcome the return of wide receiver Colbie Young who hasn’t played since suffering a broken leg in the previous Ole Miss game. Young caught one 36-yard pass against the Rebels before the injury. He had caught 23 passes for 336 yards over the first seven games.
•••
During the Georgia portion of the Sugar Bowl Media Day, all the Georgia defensive linemen were gathered at two tables. Even when they were sitting, they were huge. They made big tables look small. During the Ole Miss portion of the two press conferences, Georgia’s physical size and strength came up over and over.
“Yeah, it’s Georgia,” Trinidad Chambliss said. “They’re going to have huge guys. They’re going to have five stars; they’re going to have four stars that are hungry. Their defensive line is always stacked with dudes that can be in the NFL any given day.”
Asked about Georgia’s defensive size, Golding smiled. “First of all, they’re big human beings,” he said. “They’re really strong, really powerful. .. They got a very good pressure package to create some one-on-ones for those big guys. I think you really see their explosion and power come up when they get the one-on-one matchups:”… They’ve always been very talented up front and well-coached and they do a good job with their plans. It will be tough for us.”
•••
The Trinidad Chambliss story – from Division II Ferris State to the Sugar Bowl – has become a national story, but there’s another poignant DII story on the Ole Miss team. Safety Wydette Williams began his college career at Delta State. Three years ago, he was more concerned with Gulf States Conference rival Valdosta State. Now he’s going against the Georgia Bulldogs in the Division I playoff quarterfinals and the Sugar Bowl.
Asked if he ever dreamed of playing in a game this big when he was at Delta State, Williams answered, “Yes, I always thought of it, at Delta State and even when I was a little kid. At Delta State, my biggest thing was to stay where my feet were, get better at what I was doing and keep grinding.”
Williams shares that Delta State background with his new head coach. Of Pete Golding, Williams said, “He knows where he comes from and I know where I come from. We’re connected like that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20165310/AP25354806374895.jpg,,,2025-12-31 05:11:42.504540

The department reported this month that the state lost another 700 federal jobs in September, the most recent month for which estimates were available. That continued an eight-month string of falling federal employment numbers and maintained Maryland’s spot as the state with the most federal jobs lost this year.
Maryland has lost about 9% of its federal workforce since January, falling from an estimated 163,100 federal jobs in the state then to about 148,500 as of September, the department said.
The loss of 14,600 federal jobs in Maryland is part of the larger effort by the Trump administration to slash the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor wrote in a Nov. 21 blog post that while the government had hired “roughly 68,000 people this year … approximately 317,000 employees left the government,” a loss rate more than 4 to 1.
“This is the first time we’re under this kind of threat,” said Paul Schwartz, a retired federal worker and regional vice president for NARFE, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association. Schwartz cover Maryland, Delaware,New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., for the organization.
The District, Maryland and Virginia lost a combined total of 34,100 federal jobs from January to September. Many Maryland residents work federal jobs in the DMV area — 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government in 2023, according to a Maryland Labor Department report.
Trump finalizes 1% federal pay raise for 2026, smallest since 2021 — also under Trump

“This Administration started a witch hunt against our civil servants on Day 1, disproportionately impacting Marylanders,” Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) said in a statement. “These men and women have worked under Democratic and Republican presidents. Their only allegiance is to the American people they serve.”
The loss in Maryland could have been worse: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, where the Maryland Labor Department draws its data, revised its August data that originally reported a loss of 2,500 federal jobs in Maryland to a loss of 1,300 federal jobs.
But the numbers are not likely to get better. The September data did not include the deferred resignations that were scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. The so-called “fork in the road” option, offered to federal employees in January, gave them the choice to receive pay and benefits through Sept. 30, according to an email sent to federal employees.
The most recent numbers also do not reflect any effect of the 43-day government shutdown, from October through mid-November, the longest shutdown in U.S. history.
Because of the shutdown, employment data was not collected by BLS in October. The state Labor Department said its next report, on November, would be available in January.
“The ongoing loss of federal jobs stands to have a substantial impact on Marylanders who have spent their careers in public service as well as people across the country who count on the services our federal government provides,” Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said in a statement.
The department has provided support to federal workers throughout both the government shutdown and the shrinking of the federal workforce, offering job fairs, workshops and a $700 emergency loan for laid-off federal workers, among other support, Wu’s statement added.
Schwartz thinks the shrinking of the federal workforce will hurt more than just the affected workers.
“There are three different groups of victims with what’s going on now: It’s the federal employees who lost their jobs, it’s the federal employees who kept their jobs, but are seeing their benefits eradicated, and it’s everyone else who doesn’t understand what they’re going to be losing when they have a federal workforce that isn’t as experienced as you need it to be to be effective,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Competition for new jobs among federal workers will pose another problem for those who were laid off, Schwartz said. Many skills are niche to specific roles in the government, making the transition to a new role difficult.
“A lot of these jobs that are in the government — you can work your way up based on your skills, but they don’t translate into the private sector as well,” Schwartz said.
The loss of federal jobs is also a blow to Maryland’s economy, as those looking for jobs are not paying as many taxes, he added.
Schwartz was told when he started in the federal workforce in 1973 that he would not be wealthy, but he would have security and benefits from his job. Federal workers today are still not wealthy, he said, but now they don’t have security, either.
“The federal government is there to provide a service, not to make a profit,” Schwartz said. “It’s a dismantling of the federal government that I worked hard for.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/federalworkers_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 05:11:42.504540

I edit the section, of course, and contribute two to three columns a week. But we also rely on a number of regular contributors, such as Max McCoy on Sundays and Eric Thomas on Fridays. Mark McCormick doesn’t have a day set aside, at least not yet, but he writes frequently. Readers no doubt recognize others, including Tara Wallace and Ben Palen.
The village metaphor came to mind as I assembled this list of the top 67 Kansas Reflector opinion columns — by page views — published in 2025. You’ll see many of the names listed above as you browse below, along with surprise guests like First Amendment attorney Max Kautsch and former college president H. Edward Flentje. (I wrote all the columns without names attached.)
You’ll notice pieces from new contributors who helped us tell stories that no other news outlet in Kansas managed. Sam Foglesong wrote about his wife being fired in Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency purges. Farmer Jason Schmidt sent a heartfelt remembrance of his cow friend, Buffalo.
We relied on all of these voices to tell the story of 2025. As you might have noticed, the year didn’t just challenge. It grated. It pained. It wrenched. Yet we made it through nonetheless, refusing to be silenced by those who would like nothing more than cowed, fearful acquiescence.
Why 67 pieces? I hear that kids like the number for some reason. Enjoy the list, and I’ll see you in 2026.

(Photo by Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)Tax increases on cigarettes, cannabis and streaming services take effect in January. 
Two of those changes happen on Jan. 1. Sales tax on adult use cannabis will increase from 10% to 14%, and a 5.5% sales tax will go into effect for streaming services. 
Then, on Jan. 5, the cigarette tax will increase by $1.50, from $2 per pack to $3.50. 
These tax changes were initially proposed by Gov. Janet Mills as a means to make up part of the budget deficit. In the budget package enacted earlier this year, the Legislature included the changes for streaming services and cannabis, as well as an even higher cigarette tax hike than Mills had suggested, which had been a $1 increase. Meanwhile, the Legislature rejected the governor’s proposed taxes on ambulances and pharmacies. 
Here is how the upcoming tax changes could impact you: 
Streaming 
Digital video and audio services, such as Netflix, Hulu and Spotify, will now be taxed in Maine. That’ll show up on customers’ receipts. 
For example, a standard Netflix subscription is $17.99 per month. The 5.5% tax would increase that bill to about $18.99 per month. 
Netflix and other providers are required to note the amount of sales tax as a line item or state that the overall cost includes Maine sales tax.
The tax puts Maine among the more than half of all states and dozens of cities that levy taxes or fees on digital streaming services, aiming to recoup the revenue they lose when people cut the cable cord. 
The Mills administration described this tax as a way to address what had been uneven taxation of digital services, given the state’s existing taxes on cable and satellite TV, as well as online purchases of movies and music. 
This will generate about $17.5 million over the next two years, about $5 million in fiscal year 2026 and $12.5 million in 2027, according to Maine’s Department of Administrative and Financial Services. In the next biennium, the state expects it to bring in about $27.6 million.
Cigarettes
The largest tax hike is on cigarettes. The tax per 20-pack of cigarettes will increase from $2.00 to $3.50. There will also be corresponding increases to all tobacco-related products, including vapes, chewing tobacco and nicotine pouches. 
During debates over this tax change last session, Republicans and retailers argued the tax would hurt sales and most directly impact low-income people, pointing to data that shows they are more likely to smoke. Opponents also raised concern that the tax increase would encourage consumers to purchase cigarettes out of state or in underground markets.  
Mills has argued  the tax increase would also reduce public health expenses in the long term.
“When cigarettes are a leading cause of cancer, heart disease, stroke and when more than one-third of Maine cancer deaths each year are attributable to smoking, our current policy doesn’t make sense,” Mills said when initially announcing her proposal. 
The state hadn’t raised this tax in about two decades. In 2005, the cigarette tax was doubled from $1 to $2 per pack.
All of the tobacco tax changes, including an automatic increase in the tax rate on tobacco products, are expected to raise a total of roughly $111 million over the next two fiscal years. 
Most of that revenue, about $77 million over the biennium, is estimated to come from the excise tax increase of $1.50 per pack. 
Cannabis 
Maine is changing how it taxes recreational, often referred to as adult use, cannabis after voters legalized it in 2016.  
The budget made changes to both cannabis sales and excise taxes. While sales taxes are generally applied, excise taxes are more targeted, corresponding with specific products.
Overall, the state is raising the sales tax on adult use cannabis from 10% to 14%. That’s expected to generate roughly $15.4 million over the next two fiscal years. 
However, the state also reduced several excise taxes, which will decrease revenue by about $10.2 million over that same period.   
People with a cultivation facility license will pay an excise tax of $223 per pound, down from $335 per pound. The excise tax on cannabis trim, which is the intentionally pruned part of the plant during a harvest that can be used to make things like concentrates, will also drop from $94 per pound to $63 per pound. Excise taxes will also drop for immature cannabis plants (from $1.50 each to $1), mature cannabis plants (from $35 to $23), and for cannabis seeds (from 30 cents each to 20 cents).",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1314998931-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 04:56:38.947261

Oct. 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)Throughout 2025, I have heard from many faculty, staff, alumni and Nebraskans across the state about their university.
They have expressed pride and aspirations for the future, stories
of success and remarkable achievement, as well as their continued concerns about year after year of budget reductions and what they might mean for the future of our institution.
Our university’s incredible achievements deserve celebration, just as the heartfelt and legitimate concerns raised should matter to all. The reductions faced across our campuses year after year are undeniably part of our story. But they are only part of our story of progress and growth, our odyssey.

Fiscal challenges, especially those that dominate headlines, can easily overshadow the extraordinary hard work and remarkable achievements in our classrooms, research labs, clinics, farms, turf and hardwood happening every day across our university.
While the passion with which the university family has responded to these budget reductions speaks volumes about our collective and profound sense of loss, it also speaks clearly to their deep commitment to Nebraska’s university. That passion reflects an enduring truth: We have so much to be proud of as we face these challenges, and we have even more to look forward to as together we move ahead.
We can be proud of our successful work toward joint accreditation of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, which was affirmed by the Higher Learning Commission and approved by our NU Board of Regents.
This joint accreditation brings us into alignment with our peers, strengthens our rankings and reputation, allows us to convey a more complete and compelling picture of our collective research and student success, and spurs new opportunities for collaboration and innovation. I have no doubt that this step will define our future.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Innovation is flourishing on our campuses. At UNL, our entrepreneurship programs recently climbed seven spots to No. 35 globally in the Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine rankings, remaining the highest-ranked in Nebraska and No. 10 in the Midwest. This reflects the impact of cross-campus collaboration and hands-on experiences that empower our faculty and students to lead boldly in every field.
The university’s strength and momentum are evident across UNMC as well, where lifesaving work is underway every day. Earlier this year, Nebraska Medicine and UNMC led a first-of-its-kind clinical trial to treat multiple sclerosis — an approach that targets the immune cells driving MS. The first patient in the world to receive this therapy, a native Nebraskan, was treated successfully.
This pioneering work demonstrates Nebraska’s leadership in research with the potential to transform lives around the world.
Add to this the growing strength across all our campuses in advanced artificial intelligence, our essential role in building the future workforce, and the more than $6.4-billion economic impact we generate annually.

These accomplishments and many others underscore our continued ability to relentlessly look to the future, while remaining relevant in the moment we are in. The challenges we’ve faced and how we’ve responded reveal important strengths as well: As hard as both may be, careful fiscal management and the courage to confront existential challenges are defining traits of top-tier universities.
We stand at a pivotal moment. The University of Nebraska is an engine of progress in our state. Therefore we must have adequate support to keep running, to support the critical current and future needs of our state. As we look to the new year and a new legislative session, I hope our careful stewardship is matched with strategic long-term investment in our future.
The people of Nebraska need their university to thrive. With 150 years of excellence behind us, a reliable and growing ten-fold economic return on investment — and an extraordinary horizon ahead — we must stay focused, united and unwavering in our pursuit of what we know we can become and the future that we will build together.

Ford/Maryland Matters)The Prince George’s County Democratic Central Committee chose one of its own members Tuesday night to fill the vacant District 27A seat left by Kevin Harris, who the committee selected last month for the District 27 state Senate seat.
An overwhelming 22 of the 24 central committee members present selected Darrell Odom Sr. for the House seat that represents parts of Charles and southern Prince George’s counties.
Odom, who has been a member of the central committee since 2019, thanked his colleagues and a couple dozen people who attended the more than one-hour meeting “because this is about an effort of us all. I know this is only one phase in this process.”
Because the district includes parts of neighboring Charles County, the Democratic central committee there must also weigh in on a nominee to forward to Gov. Wes Moore (D) for appointment to the seat. That Charles County central committee is scheduled to meet Saturday morning in Waldorf.

The District 27A seat became vacant after Harris was sworn in as state senator earlier this month to replace former Sen. Michael Jackson, who became the superintendent of Maryland State Police last month.
Odom was one of three candidates seeking the appointment.
Yonelle Moore Lee, who chairs the Charles County Board of Education, received one vote, as did Lamont Tyler Bunyon, who runs an optometry practice in the county.
Each candidate was given a chance to address the committee before being asked a list of same questions, while the other two candidates were in another room.
All three agreed they would advocate for legislation that strengthens each central committee’s authority to appointment state delegates and senators.
The legislature considered proposed changes in 2024 and again earlier this year with legislation sponsored by Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel). The legislation included a provision requiring members of the central committee who apply for an opening to recuse themselves from the vote, among others. Lam’s legislation has yet to get out of committee in the Senate.
Moore Lee, also an attorney, acknowledged the controversy on the appointment process, but said the central committee members are elected to “represent the people from your districts. You are closest to the real-world solutions and know the people best that would best serve your districts.”
Bunyon, who received support Tuesday from Del. Kym Taylor (D-Prince George’s), said it’s about respecting the current rules.

“It’s easy to criticize. It’s hard sometimes to build consensus, sometimes even if you don’t agree,” he said. “One thing I learned is being a leader in this community is sometimes you have to respect the majority. You have to respect the rules.”
If Charles County’s committee doesn’t choose Odom but selects Bunyon or Moore Lee, then Odom and the other person’s names will be sent to the governor who will decide which person to appoint.
Meanwhile, the Prince George’s Central Committee has more work to do on the nomination front.
That’s because Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s), the former House majority whip who has represented District 24 since 2017, announced earlier this month that he will be stepping down to work as the director of government relations at the University of Maryland, his alma mater.
Lewis’ last day will be Jan. 5 — the same day the central committee has scheduled to meet and select his replacement ahead of the 2026 General Assembly session that begins Jan. 14.

Voucher mess up
The state’s education budget is the mechanism that keeps schools paid — public and (some) private. Until it doesn’t.
A state audit revealed last month a problem public and private schools were experiencing long before the issue surfaced in the Legislature: Money for the state’s school voucher system was not following the student as intended.
‘Funding did not follow the child’: State audit displays school choice woes

Lawmakers head into 2026 in search of a solution, and the Senate has already advanced its proposal.
The damage done by lax accounting practices in the previous school year left schools short $47 million.
Taxpayers are projected to spend more than $4 billion on school vouchers next year, making the need to refine the statutes all the more pressing.
University presidents
The metaphorical clubhouse for Florida’s state university presidents experienced a major shift in membership in the last few years, particularly in 2025. 
As outlined in a piece about Florida State University President Richard McCullough, a number of university president jobs have been taken over by friends of the governor.
The University of Florida named its second consecutive interim president in September, and he intends to apply for the permanent position. Donald Landry, a medical researcher and professor, came from Columbia University. This following perhaps the biggest presidential news this year with the June 3 rejection of University of Michigan President Santa Ono to take the helm at UF, the first such rejection in state history.
University of South Florida this month locked in former University of North Florida President Moez Limayem to lead after Rhea Law announced on Feb. 17 she was stepping down from the post, meaning UNF will kick off a search in the new year. 
Jeanette Nuñez stepped away from her role as Ron DeSantis’ lieutenant governor on Feb. 17 to become president at her alma mater, Florida International University.
That same week, former House GOP Leader Adam Hasner was approved as president of Florida Atlantic University after that school went two years under interim leadership.
University of West Florida began drawing the same treatment from the DeSantis administration that New College of Florida got a few years ago: a conservative makeover, tapping a former education commissioner to take the helm, and a controversial board of trustees.
Florida A&M University’s new president is politically connected, with experience serving in the administrations of Ron DeSantis as well as former Gov. Rick Scott. The FAMU community pushed back against Marva Johnson’s selection amid concerns that the search did not follow state law.
The Florida House this year approved making presidential searches public after the Legislature exempted them from public exposure in 2022. However, the Senate did not go along and DeSantis promised a veto if such a bill ever passes.

Lawsuits
Litigation over controversial laws during the past several years played out in court during 2025. 
Two major cases included the 2024 law banning social media use for younger children and restrictions for teenagers and another prohibiting courses involving diversity, equity, and inclusion for general education requirements for college undergraduates.
Lawmakers and the governor approved a law that requires parental consent for 14- and 15-year-olds to use social media platforms and bans it for kids 13 and younger. The law was a priority for Paul Renner, at the time speaker of the Florida House and now a candidate in the Republican gubernatorial primary.
Social media companies challenged it but were denied a preliminary injunction in March. In June, after redrafting their complaint, these companies were granted a temporary pause on enforcement.
In November, a federal appeals court voted 2-1 to allow the state to enforce its social media law. The state attorney general vowed his office “will aggressively enforce this law.”
In January, university professors challenged the state’s 2023 ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion spending in federal court.
Weeks later, the state university chancellor proclaimed that the system had eliminated “indoctrinating concepts” from the general education curriculum at Florida institutions. 
The case was heard for a preliminary injunction in March. In April, the judge ruled the state could enforce the ban while litigation plays out.
In September, the case was largely dismissed.
The state’s law purging of school books deemed “pornographic” or content that “describes sexual conduct” is before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit after a federal trial judge in August ruled it “overbroad and unconstitutional.”

Campus violence
In April, a gunman opened fire at the Florida State University student union, killing two people and wounding others. 
That prompted a reevaluation of campus safety as a group of students marched to the Capitol demanding change.
On Sept. 10, a shooter killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. Subsequently in Florida, professors and teachers were punished over social media postings criticizing his politics. Additionally, the state of Florida has named a high school debate trophy after Kirk; New College plans to erect a statute of him on campus; and legislation has been introduced in the Legislature to designate Oct. 14 as a “Charlie Kirk Day of Remembrance” and directing colleges and universities to rename one street on campus after him.
A few days before the Kirk shooting, the Phoenix published results of the 2025 College Free Speech Rankings produced by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. Those rankings found 34% of students both nationwide and in Florida consider it acceptable, at least in rare cases, to use violence to stop a campus speech. In 2024, nationwide that number was 32%; in 2023, it was 27%; in 2022, it was 20%.
Kamoutsas and locals
With Diaz leaving for Pensacola, DeSantis elevated his aide Anastasios Kamoutsas to education commissioner on June 4. What followed was a new, or a more direct, culture of public threats against local school administrators on social media and in public attacks.

Kamoutsas appeared at local school board meetings, including in Alachua and Leon counties, to criticize local officials over policy disagreements ranging from teacher salary negotiations to social media postings and has hauled county school board members in front of the state board on multiple occasions.
In September, one state board member said school district members were “clout chasing,” defying state board directives to elevate their public profiles.
The bad blood between state and local officials has escalated. Earlier this month, local officials booed Kamoutsas as he addressed a school board conference in Tampa, the Tampa Bay Times reported.
Kamoutsas opened a new X account when he became commissioner. Since, he has used the platform to issue a stream of threats to superintendents and local school board members, warning, “govern yourselves accordingly.”
New College and DOGE

Following Donald Trump’s reelection, his commitment to Department of Government Efficiency efforts leached down to the state level, with Florida promising to dive into state spending, including at universities.
In February, DeSantis promised to “prune” “ideological study stuff” at universities.
A November state report displayed each institution’s efficiency in spending tax dollars.
The results showed the per student costs at New College of Florida at nearly $500,000. As early as January, the Board of Governors had discussed whether New College was worth the spending.
The next closest in cost was Florida Polytechnic University, at about $154,000 to educate its mostly engineering students from start to finish.
The report found the University of Central Florida, with the largest enrollment, had the lowest cost to produce a degree from start to finish at $46,548.

Hardman’s win means Democrats retain the seat, formerly held by the late Sen. Claire Celsi, and they have stopped Republicans from potentially regaining a supermajority in the Senate.
“Our community made their voices heard tonight,” Hardman said. “You braved the weather, you ignored the noise and the nonsense … I am ready to work as your next senator.”

Hardman ran against Republican Lucas Loftin, who works for the forestry and environmental service company, Wright Service Corporation. Loftin and his wife are active in the homeschooling community.
Loftin, in a social media post Tuesday night said that while the results were not “what we wanted,” he would continue to have a smile on his face.
“We ran a good race, we are proud of the effort that we put in,” Loftin said.
Republicans lost their supermajority in the Senate after two earlier special elections, one in January after Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer joined Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration and another after the death of Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, in August. Democrats Sen. Mike Zimmer of DeWitt and Sen. Catelin Drey of Sioux City secured the seats.

With a supermajority, Republicans would have a two-thirds majority in the chamber without having to solicit a vote from a Democrat on matters like governor’s nominee confirmations.
Reynolds scheduled the Dec. 30 special election after the October death of Celsi, D-West Des Moines, who served as senator since 2018. The district comprises portions of Polk and Dallas counties, including parts of West Des Moines, Clive and Windsor Heights. 
Hardman formerly worked in administrative and human resources roles at Bankers Trust, Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa. 
Hardman was noted as a “spotlight candidate” for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee – a national Democrats’ campaign focused on state legislatures. 
The campaign’s president Heather Williams said in a statement that Democrats have been “on fire” with recent special election wins. In addition to the Iowa Senate Democrat wins, Rep. Angelina Ramirez, D-Cedar Rapids and Rep. Blaine Watkins, R-Donnellson, won special elections in the spring.
“Tonight, Iowans rebuked GOP chaos by blocking a toxic Republican supermajority, and made history by electing the first Black woman to serve in the Iowa Senate,” Williams said.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart congratulated Hardman in a statement Tuesday and said Hardman is “ready to step up to take on an even larger role” in the state.
“Renee Hardman crafted a well-run grassroots campaign focused on affordability, and Democrats across Iowa worked tirelessly to end 2025 with another 40-point victory to prevent a new Republican supermajority,” Hart said.
Unofficial results posted by the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office showed Hardman with 71.5% of the vote to 28.5% for Loftin with all of Polk County’s 23 precincts reporting. Dallas County had not reported results from its lone precinct as of 9 p.m.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who served two terms representing Colorado in the Senate beginning in 1993, died Tuesday at 92, according to media reports.
Campbell was elected to the Senate as a Democrat, but in early 1995 switched to the Republican Party in a move that “startled and puzzled the political world,” The New York Times reported at the time. He was reelected in 1998 but declined to run for a third term in 2004, citing health concerns.
Born in California to a Portuguese mother and a father of Northern Cheyenne descent, Campbell was the fourth Native American elected to the U.S. Senate, and the first since the 1920s. He competed in judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and later became a well-known jewelry maker while making his home near Ignacio.
Prior to his election to the Senate, he had served two terms as a state lawmaker representing southwest Colorado, and three terms representing the 3rd District in the U.S. House.
U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Republican who currently represents the 3rd District, called Campbell “a towering figure in Colorado and American public life.”
“He devoted his life to service and was a respected national leader for Native American communities,” Hurd wrote in a social media post Tuesday. “His career was defined by independence, integrity, and service above partisanship.”
Campbell served as chair of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee until his retirement in 2005. During his House tenure, he sponsored legislation to establish the National Museum of the American Indian.
He later joined the firm Holland & Knight as a lobbyist. Lake Nighthorse, a reservoir near Durango constructed in 2003 as part of the Animas-La Plata Water Project, is named in his honor.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Constellation Energy’s proposals for a new natural gas power plant in Maryland can go through an expedited permitting process, after they received an initial green light from the Maryland Public Service Commission on Tuesday.
State lawmakers created the fast-track permitting process in the spring, in response to soaring energy bills, spurred in part by a lack of energy supply in the multistate electric grid that includes Maryland.
In response, Constellation submitted two possible proposals for a new natural gas power plant in the state — a larger and a smaller option. Both would be located in Harford County, near the existing Perryman power plant, which runs on oil and natural gas.
In a news release from November, Constellation said the proposals were meant to offer Maryland policymakers a “menu of options” for new power generation in the state. Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez said in the release that the company hopes to be a “thought partner” for state leaders as they decide the path forward.
“While there is a good deal of consensus on the need for battery storage, the future of natural gas in our state is less clear.” Dominguez said in the news release. “We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want.”
During remarks at a Maryland Chamber of Commerce forum in November, Dominguez said that running pipelines to provide natural gas to the Perryman site could cost around $800 million, and said the company would likely need some form of state help to move forward with the costly plan.
After being ‘blindsided’ in 2025, advocates look to make climate part of the 2026 conversation

Tuesday’s PSC decision does not mean that either of Constellation’s new proposals will necessarily be built, only that they can go through the fast-track. Under the law, which took effect June 1, the commission has 295 days after the application is considered complete to make a final permit decision.
If constructed, though, a new natural gas plant would likely place many of Maryland’s climate emissions and clean energy aspirations out of reach. After talk of a new gas plant began circulating in the last legislative session, environmentalists pushed back hard, a fight that they expect to continue in the legislative session that begins Jan. 14. They also filed petitions directly to the commission opposing the Constellation gas proposals, and supporting battery storage.
In Tuesday’s order, PSC Executive Secretary Andrew S. Johnston wrote that the commission “is cognizant of and shares these concerns” regarding new fossil fuel-powered generation in Maryland. “However, the General Assembly has made a policy decision to expedite new generation construction, including natural gas-fired power plants under this process,” Johnston wrote.
Johnston added that environmental groups will have the opportunity to “raise concerns related to emissions and environmental justice” during the upcoming permitting process.
Constellation also submitted a proposal for an 800-gigawatt battery energy storage project for expedited review, but the PSC denied it, saying it did not meet all of the qualifications set by the legislature. Lawmakers set up the fast-track for so-called “dispatchable” energy generation, which is easy to deploy during times of peak demand.
The battery proposal, proposed for several spots on the Perryman site, fell just below a reliability threshold set by lawmakers, according to the commission, which denied the project “despite the other good characteristics” it possessed. Lawmakers did, however, create a separate approval process for battery storage projects in the legislation they passed this year.
Two other companies submitted fast-track proposals, but both were withdrawn before the commission issued its decision.
One proposal would have upgraded an existing natural gas power plant in Prince George’s County’s Brandywine, and the other was entirely confidential, much to the chagrin of environmental groups. The Brandywine proposal also received blowback, from local activists who argued that the area is already overburdened by power plants and industrial facilities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a news release issued earlier this month, a group of Perryman residents and members of the community group 3P Protect Perryman Peninsula expressed concerns about a possible new gas plant in their community. They also pushed for the PSC to take more time to review the energy proposals before deciding which could move through the fast-track.
“They’re asking regulators to move first and ask questions later,” said Stacy Stone, a lifelong Perryman resident who lives near the proposed site and serves on the Harford County Democratic Central Committee. “Maryland strengthened its environmental justice laws because communities like ours were harmed when decisions were rushed. Those protections don’t work if they’re treated as an afterthought.”
But the commission denied a request for a 60-day extension, originally filed by several other environmental groups: the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, Clean Water Action, Earthjustice and the Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club.
In the order, Johnston wrote that the “short timeline” reflects “the General Assembly’s urgency in responding to the lack of new generation in Maryland.”
“The General Assembly understood that the timeline it proposed would limit stakeholder participation in the initial review of proposals,” Johnston added.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC09165-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-30 21:11:50.791787

(Provided by DiGangi)When Karen Berg-DiGangi first became licensed as a Realtor in Missoula, other queer real estate agents told her it was better not to be “out” or open about her LGBTQ+ identity.
“I like to tell my clients that was my villain origin story because I took that as a challenge,” Berg-DiGangi said. “I feel like we are in a place where I should be able to post about my family just as much as any other Realtor should be able to post about their family and be super open and affirming.”
Berg-DiGangi filed one of the ethics complaints against Brandon Huber, a pastor and Realtor who recently announced he reached a settlement in a discrimination and religious liberty case taken up with the Missoula Organization of Realtors and National Association of Realtors.
In a recent interview, Berg-DiGangi said the public should know about her less publicized complaint against Huber — the allegations that originally led to sanctions — and the aftermath.
She said people who are queer still face challenges in real estate, but a recent change the national association made to its code and decision the local organization made to abandon its earlier stance on the Huber case undercuts support for the LGBTQ+ community.
“I feel betrayed and disappointed by both the Missoula Organization of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors,” Berg-DiGangi said. “I was told they made the best decision for the corporation.”
One case settled, ethics code changed
In 2021, Huber, then a pastor of the Clinton Community Church, cut off church ties with the Missoula Food Bank and Community Center because of its support for the LGBTQ+ community, an announcement that led to an initial complaint.
A community member who was not a client of Huber’s filed a discrimination complaint alleging his actions violated the ethics code of the National Association of Realtors, enforced by the Missoula Organization of Realtors.
At the time, the code of ethics and standards of practice said Realtors “must not use harassing speech, hate speech, epithets, or slurs based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation or gender identity.” It said the code applied to Realtors “in all their activities,” not just real estate activities.










I feel betrayed and disappointed by both the Missoula Organization of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors.


– Karen Berg-DiGangi


While a hearing panel with the Missoula Organization of Realtors cleared Huber of the complaint related to the food bank, the panel found a separate social media post by Huber had violated the ethics code.
In a demand letter this summer, Huber and a national legal firm, Liberty Counsel, alleged religious discrimination, and they announced this month the case had been settled. The agreement wiped out sanctions against Huber levied by the local Realtors and funds his local and national license fees through 2027.
The local Realtors conceded to Huber after Liberty Counsel, a national Christian organization that defends religious freedom and the First Amendment, threatened to file a complaint of religious bias against the Missoula Organization of Realtors with the U.S. Department of Justice.
Two complaints, two circumstances
In the first complaint, Huber was accused of “hate speech” after he made the decision his church would disassociate with the food bank because of its support for LGBTQ+ people.
His lawyer said his statements about that decision weren’t hateful by any stretch — and Berg-DiGangi said she agrees with the hearing panel’s decision to clear Huber of the allegation.
Berg-DiGangi summed up the comments Huber made as — “we’re not interested in this partnership anymore” — not “hateful” as alleged, and she said most Realtors with whom she discussed the case agreed.

However, Berg-DiGangi said the complaint she filed — the one a hearing panel of the Missoula Organization of Realtors found to be valid — was based on different circumstances. And she said it is based on a standard to which she believes the Realtors should have held firm.
In her complaint, Berg-DiGangi pointed to a social media post Huber had made on both his personal and pastor Facebook pages of a flyer that invited people to a rally where “Pastor JD Hall” would “expose the LGBTQ agenda that controls our lives and kills our liberty.”
(Hall was a pastor based in Sidney who ran into legal trouble and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022 after a publication he owned posted untrue stories about a transgender woman. As part of a settlement, Hall admitted the information he published was false. He was also removed from church membership.)
Huber said he was a guest speaker at the event, and he shared the flyer, but the words on the flyer were from Hall: “Those words never came out of my mouth.” A letter from Liberty Counsel said that flyer “did not demean any individual or any group,” but it highlighted a discussion about “Cancel Culture and censorship on free speech.”
In her complaint, however, Berg-DiGangi said the language has implications for real estate.
“This harassing and hateful language makes me feel both as an LGBTQ+ individual and as a Realtor that I, or my clients, would not be welcome to do business with Brandon,” Berg-DiGangi wrote in the complaint.
In 2022, the Missoula Organization of Realtors found that complaint to be valid; it ordered Huber to pay a $5,000 fine and take a fair housing class, both sanctions with which Huber refused to comply.
Huber had argued in part that the ethics code violated the Montana Constitution’s protection of civil expression, and Liberty Counsel argued unlawful religious discrimination.
In spring 2025, the national Board of Directors decided the prohibition on harassment in its policy should have a more narrow application, only to a Realtor acting within their business capacity.
An explanation on the National Association of Realtors website said the changes “are intended to reduce risk to state and local associations.”
In June 2025, Huber told the local Realtors they needed to reconsider sanctions based on changes to the national code, but the local Realtors said the changes didn’t nullify previous outcomes under previous code, according to the Liberty Counsel demand letter.
Berg-DiGangi believes that’s where the argument should have ended. She said Realtors must “sign on the dotted line” that they agree to follow a code of ethics, but Huber ignored those professional standards.
After Huber and the Liberty Counsel threatened legal action, the local Realtors lifted sanctions against him.
Berg-DiGangi said recent changes the National Association of Realtors made to its ethics code leave members of the public and LGBTQ+ people vulnerable, and she wishes the Missoula Organization of Realtors hadn’t buckled under threat.
She said the local Realtors caved, first stating they would not review former cases, and then not only lifting sanctions from those penalties, but funding license fees for Huber. She said the Missoula Organization of Realtors told her it had acted “for the betterment of the corporation.”
“Why would you reward someone who doesn’t believe in your process? Who doesn’t follow our code of conduct or our code of ethics?” Berg-DiGangi said.
Missoula Organization of Realtors’ Jim Bachand did not answer a question about why the organization reversed course in Huber’s complaint after initially stating it would not nullify previous outcomes under previous code.
“Since the conduct of Mr. Huber that was the subject of the 2022 ethics hearing was not engaged by Mr. Huber in his capacity of a real estate professional, due to NAR’s adoption of the June 2025 change to Professional Standards Policy Statement 29, MOR decided to rescind all discipline imposed against Mr. Huber,” he said.
He declined to comment on whether the Department of Justice had been involved directly with the local Realtors.
Bachand said the local Realtors do not comment on results of ethics complaints or hearings, which are confidential, but he confirmed the Missoula Organization of Realtors rescinded the discipline imposed on Huber in 2022.
“As a voluntary trade association, MOR applies ethical standards through established Professional Standards processes while also exercising its fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of the organization and its membership as a whole,” Bachand wrote.
Policy changes, then and now
Berg-DiGangi said she believes professionals in her industry who want to be Realtors, that is, official members of the professional association, should hold themselves to a high ethical standard in not only their professional lives, but in their personal lives.
The current code says Realtors can’t harass anyone based on who they are “in their capacity as real estate professionals, in association with their real estate businesses, or in their real estate-related activities.”
She said it’s likely some Christian Realtors have similar feelings to Huber but still aren’t publicly accusing LGBTQ+ people of “killing liberties,” and the recent change in the code of ethics diminishes its role.
As a result, she said, the public loses. She said she fears people might not even want to report a Realtor they believe has acted inappropriately under the new code.
“I understand why they’d be scared to say something now, and that’s not fair,” Berg-DiGangi said.
She also said the policy was instated in 2020 for a reason — after a Newsday investigation found “consistent discrimination” against people of color at brokerage firms on Long Island. In part, the investigation found Black buyers were treated differently than white buyers 49% of the time.
“I believe that you cannot, for lack of a better phrase, take off your white hood and then go sell real estate and claim to be unbiased,” Berg-DiGangi said.
Advocacy going forward
In the business since 2020, Berg-DiGangi loves her profession, helping people with one of the biggest decisions of their lives, if not the biggest one.
“Especially as a millennial, in my 30s, it feels like it is hardest for my generation,” Berg-DiGangi said. “And feeling like I can help guide them through that and still make it attainable for my peers has been really rewarding.”
She helped encourage the Missoula Organization of Realtors to sponsor Missoula Pride (she said one board member resigned immediately after the decision). She’s also working on forming a state or local chapter of the LGBTQ+ Real Estate Alliance.
Berg-DiGangi said LGBTQ+ home ownership is roughly 16% below the national average, and queer real estate clients face hurdles. For example, clients often ask if a seller can see names on real estate documents, and if they’ll be subject to discrimination if documents show two traditionally female names as buyers, for instance.
“The seller can see the names, but if they are working with a member of the National Association of Realtors — a Realtor — their Realtor should be describing fair housing to them and ensuring that the seller is not violating fair housing,” Berg-DiGangi said.
She also worked with a client who was a veteran whose Veterans Affairs benefits were in their “dead name,” a name they no longer used after they transitioned. Berg-DiGangi said it’s a team process, working with title companies, home inspectors and lenders who understand how to navigate some of the issues.
A couple of years ago, she said, the national LGBTQ+ Real Estate Alliance, of which she is a founding member, brought to Missoula an instructor for a certified ally class to teach some of the struggles LGBTQ+ homeowners face. She said Realtors had to pay for the course, and it was well attended.
Now, Berg-DiGangi is stepping down from the Missoula Organization of Realtors committee work where she has advocated for LGBTQ+ home owners and Realtors. In the wake of its decision to reverse course in the complaint she filed, she doesn’t believe the organization merits her leadership.
(She said the decision not only wiped away penalties, it rewarded Huber by waiving his real estate dues. In the meantime, she said, she had to pay legal fees for representation: “Where’s my $4,000 legal fee refund?”)
But Berg-DiGangi said she’ll keep working on opening the local chapter of the LGBTQ+ Real Estate Alliance, and she’ll continue to stand on her principles in a public way, despite the earlier guidance she should hide.
“The reality is, more people choose me because of how I present in the community than anything else, and that is both for queer or heterosexual couples,” Berg-DiGangi said. “I find that people feel that they know my values off the bat, and therefore don’t have questions of who I am and the kind of business that I do.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/original-95360995-1090-4C55-986A-2B3AB61265DC.jpeg,,,2025-12-30 20:12:17.081355

(File photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal judge in Tennessee is ordering federal prosecutors to turn over some documents to lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia as they try to show his indictment on human smuggling charges was the product of vindictive prosecution.
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw’s nine-page ruling — issued under seal Dec. 3, but unsealed at noon Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Nashville — said a “subset” of more than 3,000 government documents he reviewed appear to undercut the government’s defense against vindictive prosecution.
“Specifically, the government’s documents may contradict its prior representations that the decision to prosecute was made locally and that there were no outside influences,” Crenshaw wrote.
The order is a partial victory for Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran native who lives in Maryland, where he was stopped by immigration agents in March and deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. His removal came without due process and despite an earlier court order that prohibited  immigration officials from deporting Abrego Garcia to his home country, for fear of violence.
A series of court battles ended with the U.S. Supreme Court in April ordering Abrego Garcia be returned to the United States. He was finally brought back to the U.S. in June, where he faced new charges of human smuggling, stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was let go without a citation.
Abrego Garcia argues that the smuggling charge was concocted years after the fact to punish him for embarrassing the administration in court, and should be thrown out.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia can remain a free man for the holidays, judge rules

The charges of “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain” are tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County, Tennessee, where he was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the back of his car.
Abrego Garcia was not arrested. No ticket was issued.
But three years later, as he was winning his case to be returned to the U.S., federal prosecutors were revisiting that traffic stop. A Homeland Security agent told a federal judge earlier this year that he was told on April 28 of this year to investigate the traffic stop.
Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to the charges, that his attorneys have claimed were filed as retaliation against their client. They claim senior officials in the Justice Department pushed for the indictment, citing television interviews where Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the investigation began after “a judge in Maryland … questioned” the government and accused it of “doing something wrong,” according to Crenshaw’s order.
The government denies involvement by higher-ups, saying the decision to prosecute Abrego Garcia was made solely by Robert McGuire, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.
Crenshaw’s order includes a timeline of events. In it are several communications between McGuire and D.C.-based U.S. Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh that began on April 27, one day before a federal agent was assigned to investigate the 2022 traffic stop.
In an April 30 exchange, Singh writes that Abrego’s case is “a top priority.” McGuire writes “we want the high command looped in.”
In a May 15 email, McGuire writes about the pending indictment.
“Ultimately, I would hope to have ODAG [Office of the Deputy Attorney General] eyes on it as we move towards a decision about whether this matter is going to ultimately be charged,” he wrote, according to Crenshaw’s order.
McGuire adds: “While ultimately, the office’s decision to charge will land on me. I think it makes sense to get the benefit of all of your brains and talent in this process and as we consider this case. I have not received specific direction from ODAG other than I have heard anecdotally that the DAG and PDAG would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Singh is updated about the indictment over the next week, according to Crenshaw’s timeline.
“These documents show that McGuire did not act alone and to the extent McGuire had input on the decision to prosecute, he shared it with Singh and others,” Crenshaw wrote.
Abrego’s attorneys successfully made a case before Crenshaw that prosecutors had acted vindictively. They sought the release of documents through discovery. Federal prosecutors balked and withheld those documents, citing privilege.
Crenshaw, in his now-unsealed order, said allowing the privilege assertion to trump due process protections would undermine rulings by other federal courts.
“The Court recognizes the government’s assertion of privileges, but Abrego’s due process right to a non-vindictive prosecution outweighs the blanket evidentiary privileges asserted by the government,” Crenshaw wrote. “If the work product, attorney-client, and deliberative process privileges asserted by the government precluded all discovery in the context of a vindictiveness motion, defendants would never be able to answer the question ‘what motivated the government’s prosecution?'”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kilmar-Abrego-Garcia-and-wife-12-22-2025-1024x877.jpg,,,2025-12-30 19:56:28.157773

State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, a Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, had pledged to pursue impeachment if O’Connor, a Democrat, didn’t resign. Impeaching her would require at least 25 votes and the approval of her removal by the Nebraska Supreme Court. The Nebraska Legislature last impeached a state official in 2006, then-NU Regent C. David Hergert.
O’Connor, who has served as an elected member of the NU board since 2019, said in a statement that she did not want to “become a distraction to the Board’s important work.”
“I am choosing to resign now because I want to do the right thing for our great university,” she said in a statement. 
“The University of Nebraska is facing many important opportunities and challenges, and District Four must have a representative that can serve effectively on the Board.”
Kauth, a Republican, said O’Connor should have resigned immediately as she still had seven months’ worth of decisions at the university, including managing a $3.6 billion budget.
“Clearly, she does not make great decisions, so I question why she stayed in so long,” Kauth said Tuesday. 
Kauth’s push to consider O’Connor’s possible removal appeared to have significant bipartisan support, based on a recent survey of lawmakers by the Nebraska Examiner, which had been preparing a story on the topic. The Legislature currently consists of 33 Republicans, 15 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive.
Any Democratic support for impeachment would likely imperil her ability to continue to serve. Three Democrats had said by mid-December that they would vote to impeach, and a fourth signaled leaning toward supporting impeachment.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee and a Republican, said he was “definitely” in favor of impeaching O’Connor and that she should have resigned “a long time ago.” He noted public video evidence of the alleged crash.
“Regents, like it or not, should be a model for student behavior, and with that serious of a felony allegation and the overwhelming evidence of what happened, she should do the right thing and resign,” Murman said Dec. 18. “If she doesn’t, I think she should be impeached.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State Sens. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a Republican, and Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a Democrat, questioned why the regents had not weighed in first on O’Connor’s fate. Under the Nebraska Constitution, only the Legislature can impeach a constitutional officer.
Gov. Jim Pillen, who had served with O’Connor for four years on the regents, also had weighed in early September, suggesting that she should resign if the allegations were true. His office had no immediate comment Tuesday on the resignation announcement.
The governor, a Republican from Columbus, would appoint her replacement, which would likely add a conservative member from one of the state’s most Democratic-leaning districts until a special election in November 2026 to serve the remainder of O’Connor’s term through the end of 2030. She was reelected in 2024 with 67% of the vote.
In O’Connor’s statement, the first to address her elected position since the charges were brought in July, she credited the work of her fellow board members and NU faculty and staff. Her resignation is effective at 11:59 p.m. Jan. 9, she and NU officials separately confirmed.
“The University of Nebraska is a very special place, and it represents the unique culture and leadership that is evident in the daily lives of Nebraskans in every community across our great state,” she said.

NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, in a statement of his own Tuesday afternoon, thanked O’Connor for her service and said he and NU “look forward to working with her successor to further advance and strengthen our university.”
Kauth said O’Connor should have recognized sooner that her continued service would be a “distraction,” not a week before the 2026 legislative session begins. Kauth reiterated she would have formally begun impeachment on Day One. She had briefed a legislative committee on the process in October. Half of the committee told the Examiner they supported impeachment.
“Had we not had articles of impeachment drawn up and ready to go, would she have even thought to resign?” Kauth asked.
Charges against O’Connor were brought July 30, two months after the crash. The delay came as prosecutors awaited O’Connor’s blood test from the lab, and because the Douglas County Attorney’s Office transferred the case to the Omaha City Prosecutor’s Office to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
Until early August, O’Connor served as a deputy county attorney. 
Part of the 2026 legislative session will include plugging a projected $471 million budget deficit for the state through mid-2027. NU campus leaders have already taken steps to cut more than $40 million from NU’s systemwide budget this fall, and some lawmakers noted O’Connor’s service wouldn’t help the university system, one of the state’s largest line items in the budget.
“If the university is not living up to the standards that we think the university should, and that includes the regents, it doesn’t help,” Murman said.
Kauth said she had the 24 other votes necessary to impeach.
“No matter when that elected official chooses to misbehave and do something that deserves impeachment, we have to address it,” Kauth said. “The fact that she finally resigned means we are able to look at other issues, and we’re going to have a lot this session.”
O’Connor is next scheduled in Douglas County District Court Jan. 22. Her case appears headed to trial as her defense is subpoenaing medical records and conducting depositions.

(Photo: Keith Clark for Nevada Rural Hospital Partners)WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s administration unveiled Monday hundreds of millions of dollars each state will receive this fiscal year as part of a $50 billion rural health fund baked into Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law.
The five-year Rural Health Transformation Program — authorized under GOP lawmakers’ mega tax and spending cut package Trump signed into law in July — is designed to offset the budget impacts on rural areas due to sweeping Medicaid cuts.
Half of the $50 billion will be distributed equally among each state between fiscal years 2026 and 2030, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the remaining $25 billion, doled out over the same time period, is being allocated to states based on several factors, such as steps states are taking to improve access to care in rural communities.
The nonpartisan health research organization KFF found that the Rural Health Transformation Program would only offset a little more than one-third of the Big Beautiful Bill’s estimated $137 billion cut to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade.
According to this week’s announcement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Texas will get the highest first-year award at $281.3 million, followed by Alaska at $272.2 million, California at $233.6 million, Montana at $233.5 million and Oklahoma, at $223.5 million.
Nevada’s allocation, $179.9 million, ranked 42nd of the fifty states.
“Thanks to this landmark investment, Nevada is positioned to make meaningful advancements in support of the state’s rural health care system,” said Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo in a statement released by his office Monday.
The office’s statement identified four priorities for the funding in Nevada: chronic disease prevention and management; investment in technology, equipment, and other health care infrastructure; incentives and tuition assistance as part of workforce recruitment; and telehealth.

In Yellowstone National Park and areas just outside the park, at least 72 grizzly bears have died in 2025, mostly at the hands of humans. 
That’s according to preliminary data released by the U.S. Geological Survey and a group of researchers that focus on the species across the rocky mountain region. 
The database lists 72 grizzly mortalities this year, after Matthew Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s leader, confirmed one more death before the holidays and updated it, tying the highest recorded annual mortality among grizzlies. In 2024, published USGS data also shows around 72 known or probable grizzly deaths, though the numbers are routinely updated as wildlife managers continue to investigate some incidents.
The last two years are a roughly 35% increase from the 10-year average of 54 deaths, and a jump from 2022 and 2023 which each saw 47 recorded deaths, according to the data
Grizzly bears are classified as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, though members of Congress have pushed to delist them in recent years. 
One grizzly scientist said people should remember the high number of deaths also comes with a high number of total grizzly bears. But some conservationists said the count means grizzly bears need federal protection now more than ever despite the push to delist the species. 
 Not just numbers

Gould said that the mortality data doesn’t tell a complete story, and other data indicate a conservation success story.
“What should be noted is that looking at just the frequency of mortalities — although it can be informative — can be misleading at times,” Gould told the Daily Montanan. “As we’ve seen record mortalities occur, we’ve also seen record population abundance, and the population is still growing. 
According to Gould, the latest population estimate from 2024 was 1,050 bears in the ecosystem, an increase of around 3% from the previous year, and a vast increase from early population targets of around 500 bears during the early recovery days.  
“We’ve been reporting for a number of years that we have a large, healthy grizzly bear population that has demographically recovered and that is a conservation success,” Gould said. “I don’t think many folks 40 years ago, when the population was perhaps as low as 250 individuals, thought we’d ever be over 1,000 bears.”
A vast majority of grizzly bears deaths in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, or GYE, are related to humans — whether directly or indirectly. In 2025, 50 of the 72 listed deaths were human caused.
Nine grizzlies were struck by vehicles and two grizzlies were shot and killed by humans, one from a case of mistaken identity and one from self defense. 
Wildlife agency officials killed 21 bears due to livestock predation — mostly cattle, but one instance of pig and one of alpacas as the target — and another 18 bears were killed due to other human conflicts — such as getting into garbage cans, aggressive behavior and property damage, or becoming habituated to humans and food.
Gould said the record-high grizzly population, along with Yellowstone drawing record crowds in recent years, creates a high probability of those two entities meeting. 
“You’re kind of burning the candle at both ends,” he said. “You have a growing population and distribution of grizzly bears and an increasing human footprint in the ecosystem, and when those two elements meet, you have conflict.” 
Gould said that because the species continues to grow — even though the bears’ occupied range contracted slightly this year — it’s likely the region is reaching a carrying capacity for grizzlies. 
“We predicted this in a 2016 paper, that we’d see slowing population growth, and a fluctuation around a mean rate,” Gould said. “As well as a slowing of expansion, it falls in line with the population filling up the ecosystem.”
Some conservation organizations that are advocating for continuing federal protections, including Human World for Animals, argue the high mortality numbers around Yellowstone should be viewed with greater concern.
“When record numbers of grizzly bears die, it can be incredibly difficult for that population to bounce back,” Wendy Keefover, senior strategist for carnivore protection with Humane World for Animals, said in a statement. “Delisting would result in trophy hunting, exacerbating Yellowstone grizzly bears’ struggle to survive. Given the dangers grizzly bears are facing, now is not the time to take away their federal protections — they need them now more than ever.”
 Montana’s management role

In Montana, the state department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks has its own grizzly mortality information dashboard, launched in 2024, to track human-caused grizzly deaths. 
FWP said in a news release at the time that the dashboard is part of an effort to increase transparency, educate Montanans on why grizzlies are killed or die when they are currently federally protected, and to prove that the state is ready to manage grizzly bears on its own.
According to the dashboard, there have been 32 human-related grizzly mortalities this year, up from 29 in 2024. Some of those deaths overlap with the data from the GYE. 
Similar to the GYE data, the majority of deaths are human-related. 
Nine recorded deaths were due to vehicle collisions, including one from a train collision, seven were considered self-defense, and 10 were management removals due to livestock depredation, other human conflicts or a diseased or injured animal. 
The number of self-defense grizzly deaths has raised concerns among some wildlife biologists and habitat managers in the state.  
In an opinion piece published last month in the Flathead Beacon, a group of 31 professionals led by former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Grizzly Bear Recovery Coordinator Chris Sevheen wrote that with nearly a quarter of grizzly deaths coming in “defense-of-life,” the state should be more forthcoming with the circumstances of those incidents. 
“Reports on each defense-of-life grizzly death need not be as detailed or time-consuming as reports on human fatalities, but even a basic accounting of the circumstances could help agencies understand why the incident happened, reduce future grizzly deaths and improve public safety,” the group wrote.

Montana politicians have pushed for delisting the grizzly bear and turning management of the species over to state control for years. 
The state previously petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to delist the species in the GYE and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, centered around Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness, but the agency rejected the petition early this year. A similar petition from Wyoming was also rejected in the final weeks of the Biden administration.
But Montana’s all-Republican federal delegation has pushed legislation to delist the species through an act of Congress instead. 
U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing introduced a bill with Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman in January seeking to remove the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population of grizzlies in particular from the Endangered Species Act, restoring a ruling issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during the first Trump administration in 2017. 
That rule was ultimately vacated by a federal circuit court, and the agency reversed its stance under the Biden administration. 
In July, the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources narrowly voted in favor of the legislation, which has yet to go before the full chamber.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Grizzly_credit-USGS-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-12-30 18:56:58.936309

(File photo by Abraham Kenmore/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A white Richland County man accused of using derogatory language before shooting at his Black neighbor pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a federal hate crime.
Jonathan Felkel, 34, entered his plea on the federal civil rights and firearm violations before U.S. Magistrate Judge Paige Gossett. He waived his right, for the time being, to a federal bond hearing as he remains behind bars on state-level charges filed five months ago.
Felkel’s attorney did not respond on his behalf to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
On the morning of July 17, Jarvis McKenzie was waiting at the entrance of his northeast Columbia neighborhood for his ride to work, according to his attorney Tyler Bailey.
While McKenzie waited, Felkel, also a resident of the Spring Valley subdivision, pulled up to the exit gate, according to a police report from the Richland County Sheriff’s Department. Police say Felkel can be seen on neighborhood security footage grabbing a rifle from his passenger seat.
Felkel then allegedly fired the gun at McKenzie, who Bailey said ran away.
Felkel and McKenzie had never previously met, Bailey said. The subdivision spans 1,200 acres, according to the homeowners’ association website.
As McKenzie ran, Felkel allegedly yelled after him, “You better keep running, boy,” making his actions a hate crime, according to prosecutors. McKenzie was not injured.
In a 2006 case, Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court found the term “boy” can be evidence of racial discrimination when directed toward a Black man. The derogatory racial term has historically been used by white supremacists when addressing Black people.
Law enforcement did not name McKenzie, but he first identified himself at a news conference in August.
Federal prosecutors are arguing Felkel’s actions were racially motivated and constitute a violation of the U.S. Fair Housing Act.
Federal courts have previously ruled neighbor-on-neighbor harassment violates a person’s housing rights.
For example, in a 2020 case in Idaho, a man pleaded guilty to criminal interference with housing rights and a weapons charge after threatening his Black neighbor by burning a cross, blasting racially charged music toward the neighbor’s home and placing Nazi symbolism and threatening racial slurs on his fence.
In addition to the federal charges, which if convicted each carry a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison, Felkel faces a pair of state-level felonies and a county-level hate crime violation.
AG’s opinion says only SC legislators can create a hate crime. But 2 dozen local laws still stand.

The state crimes — assault with intent to kill and a weapons charge — come with sentences of up to 20 years and 5 years, respectively.
Richland County passed a hate crimes ordinance the month before the incident, which tacks on a 30-day sentence to the original crime, if convicted.
The hate crimes Felkel faces were charged at the local and federal level because South Carolina is one of two states without a statewide hate crime. Wyoming is the other.
Proponents of a state law (in both parties) have said they will try again in 2026.
The GOP-dominated state House has twice passed legislation that would add penalties for people convicted of committing a crime due to their victim’s race, gender or sexual orientation. But those proposals never got a vote on the Senate floor, with GOP opponents saying proving hate involves prosecuting thoughts. They also contend that violent crimes should be punished severely regardless of a victim’s identity.
Felkel has remained in the Richland County jail unable to post the $1 million bond set by a county magistrate in July for the state charges.
Bailey said his client fears for his safety and that of his family. He wants Felkel kept in jail until the case is resolved.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/federal-courthouse-scaled-1-1024x780.jpg,,,2025-12-30 18:56:58.936309

The U.S. Department of Agriculture and state departments of agriculture continue to urge producers to practice increased biosecurity to help prevent the spread of the flu. 
U.S. senators from Iowa and other agricultural states recently urged USDA to prioritize a vaccine strategy for the flu. 
Producers who notice sudden increases in bird deaths, or symptoms like lethargy, swelling of the head, coughing and difficulty breathing in their flock should contact their veterinarians immediately. 
The public health risk of HPAI remains low, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Vermont is set to receive $195 million from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, the federal body announced on Monday. 
The money comes as part of the federal government’s new Rural Health Transformation grant program that Vermont’s Agency of Human Services applied for in November. The award is almost two times what the state had expected to receive. 
“I was absolutely thrilled when I saw the number,” Jill Mazza Olson, the director of Medicaid and health systems at the Agency of Human Services, who oversaw the application process, said Tuesday.

Now, she and her colleagues are rapidly mobilizing to utilize these funds. 
The grant funding was allocated as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July, in an attempt to mitigate some of the harm Medicaid cuts are expected to have on rural hospitals. Nationally, the program will make $10 billion available each year from 2026 through 2030. Half of that will be distributed equally to states, while the other half is awarded based on additional criteria. 
Nationally, the average award was around $200 million, and ranged from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Compared to other rural states, Vermont received among the most money per-capita. New Hampshire was awarded $204 million while Maine was promised $190 million; though far less rural, Massachusetts is set to receive $162 million.
The Agency of Human Services had expected to receive the annual $100 million promised to every state, Olson told VTDigger after submitting the application in November, but the agency proposed a budget about twice that size. 
Since the federal government has promised almost the entirety of what Vermont applied for, the state’s plan will require fewer revisions before being implemented. However, Olson said it’s too early to say exactly what the final plan for the funds will look like. The Agency of Human Services will work on building a more granular plan before the federal government releases the funds to the state, she said.  
The grant includes funding to hire staff who can oversee the award’s implementation. Hiring a project manager is high on Olson’s to-do list, she said.
She expects some of the state’s proposals for workforce development and tuition assistance for providers like nurses and home health aides will be among the first things the state can put into action with these new funds, since many of their spending structures already exist.
Other initiatives will take more time to flesh out — like bolstering the use of telehealth to broaden speciality care in rural hospitals or in people’s homes, utilizing mobile health teams, or expanding models that incentivize primary care. 
The funding is one-time money, so Olson said it’s important to treat it as a supplement to ongoing work, not a lifeline. She said the state intends to build on health care reform already in process under Act 167. 
“This is not our health care reform plan,” Olson said of the grant. “This is an opportunity that we’ll use to support all of the health care reform work that we’re already doing in the state.”
Still, many see the money as a boon to the state as rural hospitals and patients face the persistent challenges of rising costs and declining access. 
“This is good news for Vermont, and I’m appreciative to the Trump Administration for their partnership on this, as we work to advance our shared priorities of rural health transformation,” Governor Phil Scott said in a Monday press release. “While there are still implementation details to work out, this significant investment will help us build on the good work we’ve started to make rural health care more affordable and accessible.” 
The Agency of Human Services will face pressure to spend all the funds in the coming year. Though the state can negotiate for more money in the future, this year’s allocation is not expected to roll over at the end of 2026.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on Dec. 24, 2025.
The Charlotte Conservation Commission is hoping to secure some big bucks to do what they say is a much-needed revamp of the town’s wildlife corridor map. They are anticipating that the work could cost roughly $25,000 to complete.
According to Claudia Mucklow, chair of the commission, the last time the town had significant wildlife mapping completed was in 2008. She noted that several different state agencies, including the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, biologists and ecologists from the University of Vermont and the Lewis Creek association, were involved in the final product.
“This was a pretty extensive plan, and at the time, I think it was probably one of the best maps that any town had,” she said. “Some of the work dates even back further, close to 20 years. So, it’s time that we update the map to see how accurate it still is.”
Mucklow noted that the mapping coincides with, and is technically mandated by, a piece of 2016 legislation known as Act 171, which states that towns and municipalities must identify significant forest blocks and habitat connectors in town plans in order to receive approval from a regional planning commission. While a town plan doesn’t inherently craft new zoning regulations or policies, it is a document that town leaders look to for guidance.
Forest blocks are areas of contiguous forest and other natural communities and habitats, such as wetlands and ponds that are unfragmented by roads, development or agriculture. But equally important to maintaining these pieces of habitats is preserving connections between them.
“These forest blocks that we have in town, they support wildlife, all kinds of cats, deer, whatever, and they need to be connected,” Mucklow said. “And if there is no connection, these forest blocks become islands, and they’re not really viable to support a lot of wildlife. Wildlife moves for a variety of reasons.”
Mucklow noted that although the town’s current map is severely out of date, it is not entirely obsolete. For example, she said, many of the forest blocks still exist, but there is no real comprehensive idea of where the corridors are on the old map.
Pete Demick, another member of the conservation commission, has been documenting some of the creatures, big and small, wandering through Charlotte’s natural areas. He’s set up trail cameras around different town areas, including within willing private property owners. Roughly 22 cameras over a roughly five-month period last year — and a few months in 2023 — picked up bobcats, bears and deer, among other species of animals.
“It’s been an incredible success,” Demick said. “The amount of wildlife that’s in Charlotte would stun people because they don’t see it.”
But for scientists at the Agency of Natural Resources, it’s not that surprising. According to the Shelburne News, which has been reporting on the issues of forest blocks in the neighboring town and interviewed Jens Hilke, a planning biologist at the agency, the Champlain Valley is actually more biologically diverse than forested areas in the heart of the Green Mountains.
Mucklow said the mapping work, completed by an outside consulting firm, could take roughly a year to complete, depending on the contractor, and would likely utilize GIS tools to identify the corridors.
The commission, for a second year in a row, has asked the selectboard to include $25,000 in their budget allocation for the work, but the board has made no promises up until this point. Mucklow said the commission has launched its own fundraising effort, with the hope of potentially reducing that monetary request, which could be more palatable to voters.
“If you talk to people in Ferrisburgh, they’re like, ‘Come on, Charlotte, stay the Greenbelt,’” Demick said, noting the development pressures that have mounted in recent years. “Just wow, has it changed over the last 15 years. You know, and it’s just forcing all the wildlife to move.”

A Thoughtful Start to the New Year With a Guided Tour at Winterthur
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | January 2026
As New Year’s Eve celebrations wind down and the calendar turns to January, many people look for ways to begin the year with intention rather than intensity. For those seeking a quieter, more reflective start to the New Year, Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library offers a peaceful alternative through both guided tours and outdoor experiences.
One such opportunity comes on January 1, when Winterthur hosts a New Year’s Day Hike from 11:15 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. The guided outdoor walk invites participants to explore the estate’s scenic landscapes at a relaxed pace, offering a chance to welcome the year surrounded by nature. The experience is designed for those who want fresh air, movement, and a sense of calm after the bustle of the holiday season.
Located in the Brandywine Valley just outside Wilmington, Winterthur combines American decorative arts, historic architecture, and expansive gardens, creating a setting that encourages curiosity, calm, and connection. A visit in the first days of January allows guests to slow their pace, take in their surroundings, and begin the year grounded in history and beauty.
Winterthur is best known for its renowned collection of American decorative arts, displayed across a 175-room historic mansion. Guided house tours provide insight into how Americans lived from the 17th through the 19th centuries, using furniture, textiles, ceramics, and architectural details to tell stories of daily life, craftsmanship, and design evolution. Knowledgeable guides help connect individual rooms and objects to broader historical themes, making the experience engaging for both first-time visitors and longtime admirers of the estate.
Winter is an especially appealing time to visit. With fewer crowds, the museum experience feels quieter and more intimate, allowing guests to linger in period rooms and appreciate details that might be missed during busier seasons. Guides often highlight how households historically adapted to colder months, offering seasonal context that adds depth to the tour.
Guided house tours are included with general admission and typically run throughout the day during museum hours, which are generally Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with the final house tour beginning in the late afternoon. Winterthur staff recommend arriving earlier in the day to allow time for both the house and the surrounding grounds.
Beyond the museum interiors, Winterthur’s gardens and natural landscape remain open for exploration year-round, weather permitting. While the gardens are quieter in winter, walking paths, wooded areas, and formal vistas offer a peaceful setting for reflection. When available, narrated garden tram tours provide an overview of the estate’s landscape design and seasonal transitions, adding another layer to the visit.
Seasonal programming often extends into early January, allowing visitors to experience the mansion decorated for winter and the holidays during the first days of the new year. These displays are designed to complement the historic interiors rather than overwhelm them, preserving the estate’s sense of elegance and authenticity.
Whether visiting solo, with a partner, or hosting out-of-town guests, a guided tour or New Year’s Day hike at Winterthur offers an experience that feels both enriching and restorative. Starting the year surrounded by history, art, and nature invites reflection, inspiration, and a slower rhythm for the months ahead.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)U.S. Highway 2 west of Stevens Pass will fully reopen by Sunday, Gov. Bob Ferguson said Tuesday.
The major east-west route was badly damaged during heavy rain and flooding that hit the state earlier this month. Closures on both sides of the pass began Dec. 10.
The west-side reopening, from mileposts 50 to 64, will provide access to the Stevens Pass Ski Resort from the Puget Sound region, a welcome development for season pass holders and businesses along the corridor that depend on winter patrons traveling to and from the resort.
“It’ll open as in, all lanes, no restrictions from here to the pass. So it’s incredibly, incredibly good news,” Ferguson said during a press conference in Skykomish, where the road has been shut down on the west side of the mountains.
With lane closures east of Stevens Pass and a lengthy detour nearer to Leavenworth, the road is not recommended as a route over the Cascade Mountains, officials said.
On Monday, Dec. 29, Highway 2 partially reopened on the east side between Stevens Pass and Coles Corner, at milepost 85, with pilot cars guiding people along a 6- to 7-mile stretch near the pass that’s down to one lane. The pilot-car-led route is open between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.
Officials still expect parts of the highway to be disrupted and potentially closed for months.
About 15 miles of the road between Coles Corner and Leavenworth through Tumwater Canyon remain closed, with a detour available along Chumstick Highway, a rural county road.
State Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith said that by the end of January, it’s possible the segment of the road with pilot car restrictions could reopen with one lane in each direction. But more roadwork in the area would be required after that, she said.
Restoring the road through Tumwater Canyon will be more difficult, especially in winter weather.
“That detour from Leavenworth to Coles Corner is going to be in place for an extended period of time,” Ferguson said. “Until March at least.”
Meredith said that there are more than 16 areas washed out or damaged in Tumwater Canyon. She cautioned that the detour around the canyon is curvy and circuitous and is not like driving on a highway. State officials recommend that drivers traveling across the Cascades use Interstate 90 as an alternate route. U.S. 12, further south, is another option.
Reopening the western portion of the highway partly hinged on inspecting a bridge near milepost 54 that was piled up with logs and other slide debris. There is a cracked girder on the bridge, and it will require further repairs, but the inspection determined it is safe enough to drive over for now.
There’s no cost estimate yet for repairing the damage along U.S. 2, Ferguson said.
The governor said the state is still working on an application for federal disaster relief to help with flood recovery and that he expects to submit it in the coming weeks.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Highway-2-Slide-Damage.jpg,,,2025-12-30 17:13:14.567399
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-30 22:01:06+00:00,Mississippi Today,"AP sources: In ‘Nassar 2.0,’ Olympics watchdog failed to close abuse case against gymnastics coach","Eddie Pells, AP National Writer",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/30/olympics-watchdog-failed-to-close-abuse-case/,"An AP investigation has found that months before Sean Gardner's arrest on allegations of installing cameras in a girls gym bathroom in Purvis, Mississippi, he was willing to accept a lifetime ban from coaching gymnastics.","DENVER — Young gymnasts and their parents started raising red flags about a coach as far back as 2017 — the same year a watchdog agency was created in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual-abuse scandal that nearly eviscerated USA Gymnastics and damaged the country’s entire Olympic movement.
But it took until 2022 for Sean Gardner to face any sanction from the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the independent agency created by Congress to investigate misconduct in Olympic sports. And it wasn’t until an Associated Press investigation this year that details emerged about the coach, whose arrest on child pornography charges in August was a turning point in a case one person involved called “Nassar 2.0.”
Now, a new AP investigation has found that months before Gardner’s arrest on allegations of installing cameras in a girls gym bathroom in Purvis, Mississippi, he was willing to accept a lifetime ban from coaching gymnastics as part of a deal where he would admit to the abuse, according to three people involved with SafeSport and its handling of the case.
A tangle of internal politics that included allegations of retaliation against employees inside SafeSport kept it from levying its harshest sanction, the people — who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by SafeSport — told the AP.
With multiple alleged victims, new witnesses coming forward and Gardner’s history at three gyms in different states, the case became one of the most troubling of the 8-year-old agency’s investigations.
“It was like, ’Well, this is ‘Nassar 2.0,’ so let’s figure out what we can figure out and wrap it up,” one person said.
That person said there was never a clear reason given for why the center did not finalize the permanent ban.
Meanwhile, Gardner has pleaded not guilty to federal child pornography charges and remains jailed pending trial, set for March 2.
Experts point out key differences between temporary and lifetime bans
SafeSport’s inability to lock down a permanent ban is seen by critics as a fundamental failure that undermines one of its key missions — securing permanent sanctions against the most dangerous abusers.
Asked why SafeSport didn’t follow through, center spokesperson Hilary Nemchik said in a statement that she could not comment about those details.
But, she said, SafeSport “took swift action to protect athletes from harm upon receiving the first allegations of sexual misconduct. The restrictions in place during a temporary suspension and a permanent ban are the same.”
Regarding SafeSport’s handling of cases in general, the statement said, “even if a respondent agrees to a significant sanction, center staff are still required to ensure the respondent receives a fair process.”
While not specifically addressing the Gardner case, Nemchik added that the center is careful not to close cases “with inaccuracies or make findings that a respondent was not properly noticed on, because it could jeopardize the case and require the matter to be reopened.”

Gardner’s temporary suspension in July 2022 was put on SafeSport’s disciplinary database — a searchable list of those banned by the center, which updates the list but does not announce new or notable sanctions. The database requires users to know the name of a person they want to check on.
The permanent ban Gardner indicated he was ready to sign in early 2025 would have changed his status on the database and closed the investigation, the people familiar with the case told the AP.
It would have limited his ability to do more damage in a number of ways, experts familiar with SafeSport told AP. These include:
— Eliminating the possibility of the case going to arbitration and any need to reinterview and potentially retraumatize athletes.
— Removing the risk of any ban on Gardner being lifted if he were acquitted in his criminal case.
Just as importantly, it would have sent a clear message to parents, people in sports and possible employers, said attorney Michelle Simpson Tuegel, who represented gymnasts in the Nassar case.
“It communicates something that’s a final determination,” she said. “That means something. It’s not like it’s something that’s being adjudicated and maybe this guy is falsely accused.”
Gardner admitting potentially illegal activity to the SafeSport Center in early 2025 could also have provided law enforcement with more information in a case that didn’t result in his arrest until August, said attorney Steve Silvey, a longtime critic of the center.
“Did he abuse any people in the months that SafeSport was sitting on that information?” Silvey said. “And where did that fit into what the FBI knew” before it arrested him?
Despite being under temporary suspension from coaching gymnastics for two years, Gardner was able to land a job in May 2024 at MercyOne West Des Moines Medical Center as a surgical technologist, responsible for positioning patients on the operating room table and assisting with procedures and post-surgery care. A hospital spokesperson did not respond to a voicemail and email from the AP seeking comment.
Gardner’s attorney, Omodare Jupiter, also did not respond to an email and phone message from the AP asking questions about SafeSport’s handling of his client’s case.
A web of office politics and staffers fearful of retaliation
The people familiar with Gardner’s case told AP it got stuck in a web of internal SafeSport politics that led to HR complaints alleging retaliation and other concerns — and eventually to no lifetime ban being imposed.
They described a dysfunctional culture in which employees were afraid to speak up to their bosses about problems they encountered, including frustration over the center’s failure to close out the Gardner case.
They said SafeSport took a survey of employees earlier this year that produced troubling results. A slideshow presentation to employees, shared with the AP, cited: “Significant concerns about retaliation, perceived favoritism and unqualified promotions” within the center’s investigation and legal departments.
“If I say something, I may get punished without being told why,” read a quote from an employee.
Nemchik did not respond to a question from AP about what SafeSport did in reaction to the survey, which came shortly after CEO Ju’Riese Colon’s ouster in April, but acknowledged “short-term cultural challenges” that came after Colon’s departure.
Nemchik said in a statement that the center expects a new CEO to focus on “organizational excellence as the center evolves under new leadership to best fulfill our mission.”
Some allegations went under the radar for years
Since his arrest, Gardner’s sanction on SafeSport’s disciplinary database has been upgraded from “temporary suspension” to “ineligible” due to “criminal disposition involving a minor” and “sexual misconduct.”
A conviction would change Gardner’s sanction to permanently ineligible to coach gymnastics. That’s the status Gardner had agreed to in early 2025, according to notes on the case file from April, one person told the AP.
“People know what Larry Nassar did and how it happened, and you let it happen again?” said John Manly, an attorney for gymnasts in the Nassar and Gardner cases, when asked to compare the two. “This center’s one job is to protect child athletes from predators. And they are failing.”
Meanwhile, SafeSport, USA Gymnastics and coaches at the Iowa gym where Gardner worked are named as defendants in civil lawsuits filed by two gymnasts who say they didn’t do enough to protect them.
The lawsuits say that in December 2017, USA Gymnastics and SafeSport were notified by one girl’s parents of Gardner’s inappropriate behavior while coaching at Jump’In Gymnastics in Purvis, Mississippi.
Among the lawsuits’ allegations:
— “Gardner requiring minor gymnasts to hug him after every practice, including long, front-facing, two-armed hugs.”
— “Gardner disciplining and intimidating a minor gymnast by taking her into his office for a 25-minute closed-door meeting without parental consent, verbally abusing her, and then hugging and kissing her without consent.”
Both SafeSport and USA Gymnastics declined to comment on the litigation.
The criminal complaint that led to Gardner’s arrest says the FBI found files of videos on his computer that Gardner made with a hidden camera in a girls lavatory as young gymnasts undressed and went to the bathroom at the Mississippi gym. The videos date to at least December 2017 through mid-2018.
The SafeSport center has said USA Gymnastics notified it in January 2018 that one of its affiliated gyms had resolved a report involving Gardner. But, the center said, it didn’t investigate further because the report was not related to sexual misconduct and it did not receive detailed information.
Meanwhile, Gardner was able to land a job at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, Iowa, in 2018 — a gym owned by renowned coach Liang “Chow” Qiao that produced Olympians, including gold medalist Shawn Johnson.
Not until 2022, when new allegations of abuse were reported to SafeSport, did the Iowa gym fire Gardner and the center place him on temporary suspension. The gym and Qiao, which are both named in the lawsuits, did not return phone and email messages left by the AP.
It took another three years and an investigation by the AP to expose the depths of the allegations against Gardner — and the shortcomings of the watchdog agency created to protect athletes in the wake of the Nassar case.
Simpson Tuegel said it’s no surprise this case is being compared to Nassar’s.
“You look at the timeline and how many people knew and failed to protect children and allowed this person to keep having contact,” she said.
“And there really is a point that you see, in some of these cases, where it absolutely could have been stopped and it wasn’t.”

The funding — the ninth-largest amount awarded to any state — is the first of a potential five years of support for Missouri through the federal Rural Health Transformation Program.
Each year between 2026 and 2030, the $50 billion program will disburse $5 billion equally to approved states. The allocations from another $5 billion annually will depend partly on reviewers’ assessment of states’ applications and partly on yearly progress. 
U.S. lawmakers portrayed the federal program, approved by Congress this summer as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as a counterweight to the federal law’s deep cuts to Medicaid. But the program will offset less than a third of an anticipated $137 billion loss of Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan health care research organization KFF.
Missouri hopes federal funds can ease strain on rural hospitals amid looming Medicaid cuts

Jess Bax, director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, said in a press release from Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office Monday that the funding could “change the landscape of healthcare access and outcomes for our rural communities.”
“By addressing longstanding health disparities affecting rural residents through these locally driven solutions,” Bax said, “we are helping rural providers build capacity, modernize services, and better meet the needs of Missouri patients.”
Missouri’s application proposes to establish 30 community hubs across 104 counties to help hospitals, clinics and community organizations identify local priorities and coordinate care. This part of the application builds on a pilot program, launched in 2024, that put six rural hospitals in charge of hubs.
Some health care advocates and rural medical providers familiar with that pilot, called ToRCH, or Transformation of Rural Community Health, told The Independent it allowed hospitals to partner with community organizations to use Medicaid funding to address underlying causes of illness.
State lawmakers put $15 million into the program during the 2023 legislative session and have made that an ongoing appropriation, though only about $8 million had been used by the end of fiscal year 2025.
Next steps include finalizing the state’s agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and putting funding in motion for “hub activation, workforce initiatives and tech procurement,” according to a press release from the Missouri Hospital Association.
Though Missouri was given a relatively large award, it ranked 36th for the amount of funding allotted per rural resident, at $115.09 per person, according to an analysis by Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis. While Texas was awarded the most funding, with $281.3 million, it got the least money per rural resident, at $59.29 per person.
The funding formula for the program took into account factors including the size of a state’s rural population, the number of rural care facilities and uncompensated care as a percent of hospital expenses.
Missouri’s application includes plans to overhaul the state’s Medicaid payment system, rewarding healthy outcomes rather than the volume of services provided.
The press release from the governor’s office named MO HealthNet, which runs the state’s Medicaid program, as the recipient of the federal funding. It said the division of the state’s social services department “is leading Missouri’s efforts to increase access to care, improve quality, enhance care coordination, and incentivize long-term sustainability.”
“The primary goal of Missouri’s plan is to revamp the Medicaid payment system to guarantee the effective use of taxpayer dollars,” said Baylee Watts, spokesperson for the social services department, in a Dec. 9 email to The Independent.
Health care experts and providers said that while they welcome federal investments in the long-term sustainability of rural health care, they worry rural hospitals won’t survive revenue losses from an increase in uninsured patients thanks to the federal law.
Rural hospitals run on tight margins, partly because they have high overhead costs but deliver lower volumes of payable services than urban providers.
Lori Wightman, CEO of Bothwell Regional Health Center in Sedalia, said on Dec. 16 that the hospital, one of the participants in the pilot program, had only 14 days of cash on hand. And, she said, the hospital needs a new roof.
“Every time it rains a lot, we get a certain leak in our operating room and then just shut down two rooms,” Wightman said. “And paying for a new roof is not the sexiest, but it’s absolutely needed to keep access in our town.”
Grants to allow providers to repair critical infrastructure and add high-demand services are some of the first planned actions with the funding, according to Missouri’s application.
The state aims to award 10 grants in 2026 for hospital infrastructure projects and three grants to introduce services like oncology or obstetric surgery.
Also on the agenda for 2026, according to the application, are tech contracts and staffing for a new Rural Health Transformation Office. 
The state plans to hire more than 100 people, assigning about 90 to run community hubs and 20-25 to seven “regional coordinating networks.”
The largest single item in Missouri’s application is for a “digital backbone” to share and track data, accounting for over a third of the state’s nearly $1 billion request at $364 million. As part of this digital backbone, the state plans to create a platform to allow medical providers and community organizations to share and follow up on referrals — including for non-medical services to keep people healthy, like food assistance.
Kehoe, in his press release, highlighted the state’s support for community organizations in Missouri’s project.
“Through Missouri’s Rural Health Transformation plan,” Kehoe said, “we are supporting local partners who understand their communities and are positioned to deliver meaningful, lasting impact for future generations of Missourians.”

In October, the Iowa Board of Nursing issued an emergency order suspending the license of registered nurse Kenneth Wayne Clark of Ankeny. The order was based on a disciplinary charge that Clark had engaged in unethical behavior and engaged in practices that are harmful or detrimental to the public by acting in a manner that is contradictory to professional decorum.
Court records show that on Aug. 1, 2025, Wayne’s home and vehicle were searched by the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office alleges it found methamphetamine, psilocybin mushrooms, and marijuana, as well as multiple pieces of drug paraphernalia — including glass pipes, bongs and storage containers for marijuana and methamphetamine.

One month later, on Sept. 9, 2025, Ankeny police alleged that from March 1, 2025, to July 30, 2025, Clark knowingly and unlawfully downloaded or possessed on his cellphone videos that are “consistent with child sexual abuse material.”
Prosecutors have charged Clark with 10 counts of purchasing or possessing the depiction of a minor engaged in a sex act. Police records indicate there are more than “2,600 unclassified videos and 60,511 images” at issue in the case, including at least 50 videos “consistent with child sex abuse material” that were allegedly downloaded onto the phone.
The court then issued a no-contact order against Clark barring any contact with minors. The Board of Nursing alleged the no-contact order was particularly relevant to its emergency order in that Clark was “doing in-home care for disabled children” prior to his arrest.
A trial on the criminal charges is scheduled for March 23, 2026.
Board closed investigation after Clark denied allegations
Clark has been an Iowa-licensed registered nurse since 1997. The Board of Nursing alleges that at some unspecified time in the past, he worked as a licensed practical nurse for Lutheran Services of Iowa and as a registered nurse for UnityPoint at Home.
The board alleges that in February 2025, eight months prior to its emergency order, it received a complaint alleging Clark used methamphetamine, possessed child pornography, and “took illicit videos and photographs of people” without their knowledge.
Board records state that investigator Laci Olson spoke to Clark, who denied the allegations and, “accordingly, the complaint was closed in June 2025 due to insufficient evidence.”
Three months later, in September 2025, Olson came across a news article that reported Clark had been arrested and was facing 10 counts of possession of child pornography, three counts of possession of a controlled substance, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia. The board then reopened its investigation, filed its emergency order, and scheduled a disciplinary hearing before an administrative law judge.
According to board records, Clark failed to appear for the hearing but later sought a continuance that would defer the proceedings until the criminal case was concluded.
The board denied that request and then amended the charges against him to one count of engaging in unethical conduct and one count of possession or use of a controlled substance. The charge of behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum was dismissed, with Administrative Law Judge Kristine Dreckman noting that “there is nothing in the record to show (Clark) behaved badly at work.”
In ruling that a license revocation was warranted, Dreckman concluded Clark’s actions “in this case are particularly egregious,” adding that she “cannot conceive of any explanation or mitigating circumstances that would warrant anything but the revocation of his licenses to practice the profession.”

Jeff Landry has set election dates for seats on the Louisiana Supreme Court and state school board. Both districts are based on the north shore and were vacated earlier this month. 
The first primary for both races will be held May 16. A primary runoff, if necessary, will be June 27, and the general election will be Nov. 3. The races will appear on the same ballots as the high profile U.S. Senate and Public Service Commission races taking place in 2026.

Voters will have to pick a new associate justice for District 1 on the Louisiana Supreme Court, which includes all or parts of Livingston, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa and Washington parishes. 
They will also be picking a new District 1 member of the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which includes all or parts of Jefferson, Orleans, St. Tammany and Tangipahoa parishes. 
The special elections are necessary because the officeholders were selected for federal positions earlier this month and resigned from their Louisiana posts shortly before Christmas. 
U.S. senators confirmed Judge Will Crain, R-Madisonville, on Dec. 9 to a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Court of the Eastern District of Louisiana. He stepped down from the Louisiana Supreme Court Dec. 23. His elected replacement will serve out the remainder of his term ending in 2030.

The Senate also confirmed BESE member Paul Hollis, R-Mandeville, as the new director of the U.S. Mint for a five-year term Dec. 18. Hollis stepped down from the state school board Dec. 19, and his replacement will serve out the rest of his term ending in 2028. 
Landry set the special election dates through proclamations signed Dec. 23 that were published as public notices Tuesday. 
Both special elections will be held using Louisiana’s new semi-closed primary election system.  
For decades, Louisiana has mostly used an election process that doesn’t limit voter participation in primary elections based on political party. But Landry and lawmakers have put a new, more restrictive election system in place for state Supreme Court, state school board, Public Service Commission and congressional races. 
For those offices, Republican and Democratic candidates will run in primaries only featuring candidates from their respective political parties. Voters who register as Republican or Democrat will also only be able to participate in a primary election of their chosen party.

Voters who are not registered with a party – sometimes referred to as “independent” voters – will be able to vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary, but not both. Voters registered with a political party that is not Democrat or Republican will not be able to participate in a primary election at all. 
The races subjected to semi-closed party primaries could also involve a maximum of three rounds of voting instead of the traditional two maximum rounds. 
For example, voters will pick candidates for the open Supreme Court and state school board seats during an initial round of primaries May 16. If no candidates receive more than 50% of the votes in those primaries, then runoff primaries between the top two vote-getting candidates in each party primary election would be held June 27. 
The Republican and Democrat who emerge from the primary battles would then run against each other in the general election Nov. 3. Other candidates who are independent or members of minor political parties may also be on the ballot, but the new semi-closed primary election system makes it harder to do so. 
Republicans and Democrats running for offices under the new semi-closed primary system can pay a filing fee to sign up as candidates for those elections. Everyone else must gather signatures in order to become a candidate on the ballot. 

For example, candidates not from a major political party who run for the open Supreme Court and school board seats would typically have to gather 1,000 signatures from district voters who are not registered Democrats or Republicans over a three-month period. 

But given the compressed timeline for these special elections, Landry has reduced the signature requirement. 

Those wishing to qualify for the Supreme Court and state school board seats will only have to gather 150 signatures from voters who are not Democrats or Republicans by Jan. 30 to secure a ballot spot.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Election-Day-8-1024x716.jpg,,,2025-12-30 16:57:10.559401

A Kenton County child who had not been vaccinated against the flu this season has died from influenza, Kentucky’s first pediatric flu death this season, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced Tuesday. 
This comes as Kentucky is experiencing a higher rate of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for the flu among children younger than 5 than in 2024, according to the cabinet. 
“Team Kentucky is deeply saddened by the loss of a child to influenza,” the cabinet’s secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, said in a statement “Our hearts are with the family during this incredibly difficult time. This is a heartbreaking reminder that the flu is not always a mild illness, especially for young children and people with high-risk medical conditions.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kentucky Department for Public Health and other health organizations say that most everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine. There are rare exceptions to that guidance, including for those with allergies to vaccine ingredients. 
Search for vaccines by ZIP code at https://www.vaccines.gov/en/. Vaccines are generally available at pharmacies and health care clinics around Kentucky. 
“While flu activity is increasing across Kentucky, there are proven steps families can take to protect their loved ones,” Dr. John Langefeld, commissioner of the Kentucky Department for Public Health, said in a statement. “The flu vaccine is safe, effective and widely available. It is the best way to reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death.”
According to the cabinet, “most” flu and COVID-19 cases are mild but some symptoms signal more serious cases that need medical attention. Those symptoms include difficulty breathing, seizures, bluish lips or face, fevers higher than 104 degrees, coughing that improves but then comes back or gets worse, and dehydration, according to the cabinet. 
Young children, adults older than 65 and immunocompromised or chronically ill people are most at risk for serious flu cases. 
The cabinet also recommends people take general precautions against illnesses like flu: Wash hands with soap and warm water, cover coughs and sneezes and stay at home from work or school when sick.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-30 21:31:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,I took the National Museum of African American History and Culture for granted. Trump’s threats changed that,"Drew Costley, Verite News",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/30/national-museum-african-american-history-culture-trump-threats/,Journalist Drew Costley writes that he delayed going to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. But the Trump administration’s push to alter the depiction of American history created an urgent need to visit the museum in Washington.,"This article is republished from Verite News, one of Mississippi Today’s partner publications in Deep South Today.
Sally was 14 years old when she was put on a ship leaving Port Pontchartrain in Milneburg, now part of New Orleans, presumably to continue a life of forced labor and other untold horror in Alabama. She stood 4 feet 8 inches tall. 
That’s all I know about her, a single line from a January 1844 slave manifest for the ship Fashion, written for its trip to Mobile. 
I found out about Sally earlier this month as I stood on the lowest level of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) in Washington, D.C. There, the tattered manifest, containing everything I’m ever likely to know about the girl,  was displayed behind glass, inspiring a flood of questions.
Who was Sally ripped away from? What was her life like before she was shipped away to Mobile?
Where did she end up — was Mobile the last place she would see, or was that just a transfer point?
How did she cope with the uncertainty of the devil she didn’t know?

A few paces away from the ship manifest, there was a poster advertising the sale of Isam, George, Betsy and Mary Jane, among others, at a slave auction at City Hotel on Common Street, in what’s now the New Orleans Central Business District. Isam had done enough in his roughly 40 years on Earth to warrant being described as “superior engineer and blacksmith … well known for character and qualification throughout the Parish of St. James.”
But the rest of them had much shorter CVs. There was a “house and confidential servant,” a “house girl,” a “field hand.” I wondered about them — these people whose entire lives were reduced to the roles that had been imposed on them — just as I had wondered about Sally. 
That ship manifest and slave auction poster are just two of the more than 150 artifacts of the centuries of dehumanization African-descended people endured at the hands of European settlers that are on view at the museum. These artifacts are proof of the immense suffering caused by the people who colonized the Americas, evidence of the exploitation used to birth the United States, watermarks that show exactly how much oppression a people can overcome.
And if it were up to President Donald Trump and his administration, I wouldn’t be able to see this history on display here. 
Since the early months of his second term, Trump has repeatedly criticized some of the ways that American history has been portrayed in the Smithsonian’s museums, demanding changes that reflect what he says is a more positive vision of this country’s story. Or, as critics see it, a whitewashing of that story. 
In Trump’s March executive order “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” he wrote that the Smithsonian has “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” Then, in August, his administration sent a letter to Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and founding director of NMAAHC, stating that he was going to start an internal review of select Smithsonian museums ahead of July 4, 2026 — the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding.
“The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been,” Trump wrote that month on his social media platform, Truth Social.

In the letter to Bunch, Trump’s aides outlined a timeline that the administration wants the Smithsonian to follow to ready its museums, including NMAAHC, the National Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of American History, to be seen by tourists visiting Washington, D.C. for the 250th anniversary celebration.
By Dec. 10, the museums were supposed to “begin implementing content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.”
It’s not yet clear what will become of the exhibits now on display in the museum. The Smithsonian Institution did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did White House officials.
All of this was alarming to me, a descendant of slaves whose roots in the Washington, D.C., region run deeper than the founding of the U.S., for a number of reasons. First, the Smithsonian museums — like the Hirshhorn Museum and the National Museum of the American Indian — are some of my favorite places to visit. To see their collections come under threat was worrying. Second, as a journalist, I value truth and accuracy not only in the first draft of history, but in all of its subsequent versions.
The third reason was the hardest to admit: I had never been to NMAAHC, and these threats to force revisions of museum materials meant that I may never be able to see the space as intended by the people who created it.
‘I took it for granted’
Black America was abuzz over the opening of the NMAAHC, or the “Blacksonian” as it came to be affectionately known, in 2016.  The museum was established in 2003 by an act introduced by Civil Rights icon John Lewis and signed into law by President George W. Bush. I learned more about all of the effort and energy that went into making the physical space a reality, including Bunch’s fight to have the museum located on prime real estate on the National Mall.
People I knew were excited that there was going to be a physical site that would contain a history long ignored by the mainstream in the U.S., one that was only fully taught in historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Black studies departments, and in Black families. 
I was excited that it would be there, too, for others but I was less enthusiastic about going there myself. I was raised in a Black family that taught us about our community’s history (more on that later) and I went to an HBCU, so I knew a lot more about the history that would likely be contained in the museum than the average person.
And by the time the museum was going to open, I had grown tired of the focus on the symbolic advancement of Black people that became the norm during the Obama years. 
Right or wrong, I felt like there was more of an emphasis on the importance of representation  than on improving the material conditions of Black people in this country. The hype surrounding the opening of the museum — at first, tickets were so hard to come by they were treated almost as status symbols  — felt like more of the same.
Because of all of that, I ended up doing something that many people who grew up in the D.C. area do with the many attractions, historical sites and halls of powers that line the National Mall: I took the museum for granted.
It has the same sense of permanence that I think of when I think of the U.S. Capitol and Washington Monument (which I also hadn’t been inside of). The museum was something that I would visit eventually, but there was no rush.
All of that changed when I first read about the Trump administration’s demands of the Smithsonian Institution. I felt a mix of shame, guilt, stupidity and frustration. I felt like I had betrayed some duty to bear witness to the museum and the history it contained. I felt dumb for assuming that anything in this universe is permanent, let alone a monument to the history of a country that is itself only a few hundred years old. 
And I was annoyed that Trump and his operatives had even jeopardized my ability to act like a punky brat about visiting the museum.
I could no longer take it for granted.  So Dec. 10, I caught a plane from New Orleans to Washington, where I grew up, to get my first, and possibly last, look at what the Smithsonian describes as an attempt to present the “unvarnished truth of African American history and culture.”
‘It’s really heart-wrenching’
It was easy enough to find fans of the museum who had opinions about the Trump administration’s threats.
It was much more challenging, though, to find people who work or worked there who were willing to talk about how the museum is responding. For months, I sought out current or former employees of NMAAHC, and received minimal responses. The museum’s media team also didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. I also contacted people in leadership at organizations that helped get the Blacksonian off the ground as founding donors, but they didn’t want to talk either.
Finally, I was connected with Jordan Blanchard, who was an intern at the museum from 2017 to 2018, during the early years after the opening of the brick-and-mortar building. (The Smithsonian first launched a website for the museum in 2007, nine years before the grand opening of the physical space.)
Jordan’s internship at the NMAAHC was one of her first jobs. She grew up in New Orleans like her father, jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard. But she spent breaks from school in Washington, D.C. — where her mother, Robin Burgess, is from — and visited Smithsonian museums while staying in town. (Terence Blanchard serves on Verite News’ board of advisers.)
“It was really always my comfort space to be in a building surrounded by old stuff,” she told me. So, when she took a gap year before college, she applied to the Smithsonian’s internship program, and her top choice was to work at the African-American museum.
The day of her job interview marked the first time she set foot in the building. As she walked in, she was distracted by a disagreement she’d had with her mother over what she should wear, she told me. But her focus quickly shifted once she began to explore the building.
Even though she was well-educated in Black history and the African diaspora, she was still blown away by the care put into telling the stories that made up the exhibits and designing the spaces where they were kept. She began at the lowest level of the building, where museum volunteers and regulars tell first-time visitors they should start. That floor contains artifacts and information about the Transatlantic Slave Trade and chattel slavery in America.
“It just gets so devastating from there, and then there’s a whole emotional roller coaster that you go on to sort of mimic the highs and lows of our broader journey as a population,” she said. “It’s really, honestly wild for anyone who’s never been there before.”
Blanchard’s year at the museum was formative. She was a public relations and marketing intern, so she had to study the museum’s exhibits to be able to communicate about them with visitors and the press. When family and friends came into town, she gave them tours and directed them to specific exhibits connected to their family and community histories. Working around so many Black women with advanced degrees gave her confidence, she said, that she carried with her as she earned master’s and doctoral degrees.
So it’s been frustrating for her to see the Trump administration raise issues with how the museum portrays Black history.
“I don’t think that there is much positivity at all in asking us to hide the injustices that our community has faced, specifically at the hands of white America,” she said. “And I’m very firm in not censoring that part of our history whatsoever, especially coming from the South, especially coming from a place like New Orleans.”

Everyone else I spoke with about the administration’s moves in relation to the Smithsonian shared Blanchard’s frustration. A scholar who has conducted research at the museum spoke with me on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation for speaking out against the Trump administration. She said that working at the Blacksonian was “an experience of a lifetime” and that the pressure placed on the museum by the administration is “horrific.”
“It’s really heart-wrenching because … it took so much energy and effort to finally get off the ground, and it is not even a decade old and it’s already being undone in some ways or sidetracked from its vision,” she said.
Divisive and dangerous
Avatara Smith-Carrington, associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said that the letter to Bunch is part of an “ongoing attack” on teaching Black history and culture by not just the Trump administration, but conservative legislators across the U.S., including in K-12 and post-secondary institutions. In 2020, during his first term, Trump signed an executive order meant to discourage the teaching of what his administration called “divisive concepts” about racism and sexism in federal agencies, civil service, and the military.
Between then and late last year, state legislatures passed 51 laws restricting race education, according to reporting from The Washington Post. Some of these, like Florida’s 2022 Stop WOKE Act and similar laws passed in Texas, Tennessee and Oklahoma, effectively prohibit public K-12 schools from teaching about the role of race in shaping America. The Smithsonian, Smith-Carrington said, is just a new theater in the war over public education.
“It is an escalation,” they said, “We’re talking about historical sites across the country that are being impacted by the administration’s efforts to essentially write their own version of what is American history that not only excludes Black people, Black culture and Black history, but also minimizes the ways in which Black people have persevered.”
Recent efforts to censor Black history are “just plain dangerous,” Chandra Manning, a historian who teaches about slavery, the Civil War and emancipation at Georgetown University, told me. We spoke at the onset of the 43-day shutdown of the federal government this fall, which came just after I initially booked my trip to go see the Blacksonian for the first time.
At the time, given the shutdown, which temporarily closed the museum, I told her I was worried I might not see it before alterations were made to exhibits.
She couldn’t offer any reassurances.
Instead, she shared her worries with me about the push to revise American history to exclude the struggles historically marginalized groups have had to overcome in order to survive.
“This looks like a concerted effort to edit out periods of conflict, and in particular, to edit out anything to do with anybody who’s not white,” she said. “And that is dangerous.”
That’s because, she said, that the erasure of a group or groups from the past can serve to make erasing them now and in the future seem more legit.

I reached out to Smith-Carrington and Manning both because they work with groups who, in one form or another, are doing something to preserve Black history.
About a month after Trump name-checked the Smithsonian leadership in his “Restoring Sanity” executive order, a coalition of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the National Urban League and African American Policy Forum, vowed to defend Black history from censorship A few days later, leaders of some of those organizations, including former New Orleans mayor and Urban League President Marc Morial, led a march of hundreds of people on the National Mall to the NMAAHC (Morial serves on Verite News’ board of advisers).
The Legal Defense Fund has litigated on behalf of the NAACP to challenge legislation meant to curb the teaching of Black history in public K-12 schools, most recently in a lawsuit against the state of South Carolina over a new law restricting how public schools can teach about the history of racial inequality.  
When I asked Smith-Carrington if the LDF would sue to stop the push to review and potentially alter material in the Smithsonian museums, they said the LDF is “committed to exploring all avenues in terms of supporting efforts that will allow for Black history and culture to continue to be shown,” but said that support could take the form of policy development, organizing or communications, not just litigation.
And just days after the Trump administration published its August letter to Bunch, Manning co-founded Citizen Historians for the Smithsonian with fellow historian James Millward and technologist Jessica Dickinson Goodman. The project is an effort to digitally preserve the exhibits of the Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Over the course of seven weeks beginning in August, more than 1,500 volunteers took nearly 50,000 photos and videos of exhibits at these institutions and documented 100 percent of Smithsonian exhibits, according to the group’s website.
“We certainly aren’t capturing the full story of the Smithsonian by a long shot, but we are capturing one little thing, and that is a snapshot of” what the exhibits looked like in 2025, before any changes were made, Manning told me.
That was reassuring, actually. Still, I needed to see the Blacksonian for myself.
‘What we create’
I was on the second floor from the bottom at the museum when an eerie familiarity set in — the warble of an organ playing gospel music: I realized I was walking into a recreation of a funeral. I walked down a narrow hallway that opened up into a small room with pictures and information on some of the walls and a couple rows of pews. Most of the room was dimly-lit, except for a bright set of lights shining on the casket of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was abducted and lynched in Mississippi in 1955 after being accused of whistling at and grabbing a white woman (the woman in question later said her testimony as to what happened was a fabrication).

A deluge of sadness, anger and desperation — the kind of desperation to reverse a tragedy that can’t be undone — engulfed me as I walked up to his casket. It was the boy’s real casket, which was donated to the museum in 2009. After a few moments standing in front of the casket, I became overwhelmed and had to sit down in a pew. 
A burgeoning of tears that accumulated during my tour through dozens of exhibits about slavery and Jim Crow crested and crashed, and I began crying.
There was a placard in front of the stage where his casket lay that reminded me that we share the same birthday. He was born two years before my dad, and his middle name, Louis, was my dad’s first. My first name is the same as the city where he was lynched: Drew, Mississippi. I remembered the three Black men — my father, my brother, Damon, and my childhood friend, Alex — whose funerals and memorials I attended over the last six years.
Immersive experiences like the one I had at the Emmett Till memorial are important to conveying the suffering that Black people experienced throughout American history, and one of the specialties of the Blacksonian. 
It was clear to me that there was a lot of attention paid to dimension and atmosphere, especially in the museum’s lower levels. A dark, cramped room toward the beginning of the “Slavery and Freedom” section of the museum gives a sense of the space Africans were forced into on slave ships on the Middle Passage.

At one point, as I walked through that section, I heard a young man declare, “This is crazy,” as he got the attention of his family and ushered them over to what he was looking at. He showed them a paragraph describing how slaves were stripped of their religion. The rest of his family were just as surprised as he was.
And, I think, this is at least one reason why all of the people who spoke with me about the threats to teaching about the horrors of America’s past at the Smithsonian — and public education in general — are worried. People aren’t even fully aware of all of the suffering and struggle that so many endured in order to create this country. So the push to censor public education, whether it be in schools or museums, is part of an attempt to halt and reverse the material gains made by historically marginalized groups.
To try to water down the parts of the museum that the Trump administration might consider “divisive,” as it described in its letter, would also lessen the effectiveness of the design of the museum. As someone who loves museums in general and appreciates the art of educational design in particular, the Blacksonian was far and above other museums in terms of its thoughtfulness about how to present concepts and immerse visitors in their learning.
The Interactive Lunch Counter exhibit on the same level of the museum as the Emmett Till Memorial places visitors in the shoes of those who participated in the sit-in movement through a choose-your-own-adventure game. A few floors up from that, there’s an area where people can start to research their family histories. A genealogist is there on Tuesdays and Thursdays to guide people through that process. Bars, bunks and a toilet, all made of metal, that used to furnish a cell at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola are on display.
And in the museum’s Musical Crossroads section, the Mothership from Parliament-Funkadelic’s stage show is hanging from the ceiling, there is a pretend record shop where people can learn about music from across the African diaspora, and there is an interactive exhibit where visitors can create compositions using samples of music from a variety of Black music genres. I can’t believe I slept on this museum for so long.

One of the things that I noticed about the museum’s lower levels — where slavery, segregation and white supremacy are heavily discussed — is that many of the displays and exhibits can’t easily be scrubbed away. Quotes about the horrors of anti-Black racism are painted onto the walls. The names of Black people who were lynched during the Jim Crow era are etched into glass. The truth about the centuries of slavery and segregation Black people experienced in the U.S. is inextricably linked to the building, as it is with the history of the country. 
When I went home to visit the museum, I spoke with one of my older cousins, Nadia Conyers. She was an NMAAHC Ambassador in its early years, meaning she donated to the museum and promoted it in the community. In return, she was able to do cool stuff like attend the museum’s opening night in 2016, bringing my little cousin DJ, when he was still in elementary school.

We talked in the living room of the home that she and her husband bought from my godmother, on either side of a coffee table with a glass top that had pictures of multiple generations of our family underneath. She said that the Blacksonian tells a more complete history not just of Black Americans, but also of white Americans. And it tells the story of all of the ways a people can overcome such ubiquitous oppression over the course of time.
“I think that the museum speaks directly to when we’re put in those situations, what we create and what happens as a result,” she said. “And that is terrifying to people in an administration like that, and to have that symbol in your backyard, of, even if you do this to us, this is what we can do. He doesn’t want that. That’s too much.”

Nadia and I are both the grandchildren of Phyllis Costley, a woman who, along with other parents in Arlington, Virginia, successfully fought to desegregate schools in the state in the face of massive resistance. We’re both descended from a family of educators. So we both know the importance of knowing Black history and passing the word down.
And, well, she’s my big cousin.
So I wasn’t surprised at her reaction when I told her that I hadn’t gone to the museum until a couple of days before we spoke. But the reason for her response surprised me.

“I’m astonished, because coming from where we come from, we take the Smithsonian for granted, because we live here, right?” she said. “But to hear that you didn’t go to the African American museum is wild to me because as the grandchild who is the storyteller of all of us, I’m like, how is it that you didn’t go to the museum? You being the child of your father, who was someone who was a history buff. It’s like one plus one equals two.”
I assumed that there would be some relatively broad reasoning for her astonishment that I hadn’t visited before, like “all Black people have a duty to go,” or something like that. But when she said that I have a role within our family as a storyteller and a love for history that I got from my father, my prior negligence carried new depth and weight. It reminded me of a concept that I learned in my young adulthood that has stuck with me over the years: sankofa.
Sankofa, a word that comes from the Akan language of Ghana, has evolved in the Black community over time to mean that we can learn from the past to build the future. The two literal translations I found online are “it is not taboo to go back and fetch what you forgot” and “it is not taboo to fetch what is at risk of being left behind.” I was taught that it’s imperative to learn from the past in order to inform the future and that you are sent off into the world to acquire skills and knowledge that you then use to help your village. This isn’t only a quaint piece of wisdom passed down through generations — it is a matter of survival.

I’m grateful that I finally made my pilgrimage to the NMAAHC and got to it before the Trump administration could.

(Photo via FWC)Fifty-two bears were “harvested” during the recently wrapped 2025 bear hunt, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a release Tuesday.
The bears were physically checked by FWC staff and contracted bear response staff. The agency said that a full report will be released in the coming months. The FWC did not break out the data to show how many bears were killed in each of the four approved bear hunting zones or the sex of the bears killed.

“The 2025 black bear hunt, rooted in sound scientific data, was a success. We’re proud to have joined the more than 30 states that manage black bears with regulated hunting,” said FWC Executive Director Roger Young said in a prepared statement.
“The limited number of permits issued in areas with the largest bear populations and other components of the hunt prioritized a conservative approach that ensures the long-term health of bear populations in Florida, while providing opportunity for hunters.”
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050. The 2025 hunt was the first since in a decade. The state shut down the last hunt in 2015 at the end of its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
The 2025 rules gave hunters the green light to kill bears at game feeding stations, using food to bait the animals. The rules allow hunters to use dogs to assist them in the hunt beginning in 2027.
The FWC said in the release that the hunter “success rate” is very close to those in other states with similar hunt rules. It didn’t further elaborate.
The FWC said it awarded 172 bear hunting permits for the 23-day event; each permit allowed the killing of one bear.
FWC members agreed earlier this year to allow hunters to kill black bears within four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 31 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in a South hunting area.
Bear Warriors United tried unsuccessfully to shut down the hunt, arguing that the FWC relied on outdated data in approving it. The group also argued that the hunt was politically motivated because FWC staff did not initially recommend a bear hunt during a December 2024 presentation on its Florida Black Bear Management Plan.
But Leon County Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey denied the organization’s request for a temporary preliminary injunction.

“Hunting is an effective tool for managing wildlife populations around the world and is a key part of the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation,” said FWC Chief Conservation Officer George Warthen. “It’s about helping bears succeed over the long term in our state and is a way for us to guide an iconic Florida species into the future, for their benefit and ours.”
The release notes that the FWC Division of Law Enforcement was actively involved in the hunt, which the agency maintains led to strong compliance with the governing rules and regulations. Although one hunter received a warning for a minor violation, the FWC said in the release that it issued no citations.
“Our officers maintained a strong, engaged presence throughout the hunt to help ensure it was conducted safely and legally,” Colonel Alberto Maza, director of the FWC Division of Law Enforcement, said in the prepared statement. “While our officers were there to uphold the rules, the primary focus was education. I’m proud of our officers for protecting this important resource and supporting the goals of the agency’s Bear Management Plan.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Florida-black-bear-via-FWC-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-30 16:57:10.559401

Larry Rhoden announced state economic development grants in two more communities Tuesday, drawing criticism from opponents in the race for governor who equated the announcements to campaigning.
Rhoden awarded $900,000 to Dakota BioWorx in Brookings, a bioprocessing pilot facility in South Dakota State University’s Research Park, and $500,000 to the city of Watertown for infrastructure improvements at Calvin Industrial Park.
The news comes shortly after Rhoden announced a $1 million grant to support two new business parks in Aberdeen, the hometown of Toby Doeden, one of Rhoden’s opponents for next year’s Republican nomination for governor.

Doeden said the timing and tone of the grant announcements make them look more like campaigning than governing. Doeden alleged that Rhoden “uses taxpayer money the same way career politicians have been using taxpayer dollars for decades — largely for his own benefit.”
“His latest attempt to buy votes with minuscule handouts to communities he has otherwise entirely ignored will prove to be too little too late in the eyes of the voters,” Doeden said.
Rhoden responded to the criticism during the event in Brookings by saying, “I am doing my job.”
“We’re in a campaign, but life goes on,” Rhoden said. “And I continue to be governor through this campaign, so we’re going to continue to do our jobs and do public announcements like this. I think we owe it to the public to let them know what we’re doing as a state.”
The source of the grants is the Future Fund, a pool of money that was created in 1987 at the request of then-Gov. George Mickelson. It was placed under the control of the governor, with the intent of enabling the state’s chief executive to respond quickly when economic opportunities arise.
State law mandates only that the fund be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” The money comes from South Dakota employers, who pay a fee to the Future Fund when they submit payroll taxes to the unemployment benefits program.
Rhoden’s other two competitors in the June 2026 primary election also criticized his recent Future Fund announcements.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, said Future Fund grants are an important tool for helping South Dakota’s economy; however, he said, “they aren’t meant to help someone’s campaign.”
“Even if these projects have merit, taxpayers are right to worry when the announcements start looking like campaign rallies,” Johnson said.

State Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said “it’s obvious that the Future Fund has been used by governors for political favor.”
“At this point, the Future Fund isn’t funding South Dakota’s future, it’s funding the governor’s political future,” Hansen said.
Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, sparked controversy and bipartisan lawmaker criticism with several uses of the Future Fund, including a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore, a Rapid City-area shooting range that legislators refused to pay for, a Governor’s Cup rodeo in Sioux Falls, and a workforce recruitment campaign that Noem starred in.
Eight lawmakers recently filed a bill that would take some control of the fund away from the governor. The bill would require each Future Fund grant to be approved by a majority of the Board of Economic Development, which is appointed by the governor and already has oversight of other economic development programs.
The current, unobligated Future Fund cash balance is $20 million, according to the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. The state budget gives Rhoden the authority to spend $7 million more from the Future Fund this fiscal year, which ends June 30. South Dakota’s primary election is June 2.
Publicly available information indicates Rhoden has awarded at least $4.5 million from the Future Fund since he became governor in mid-January.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EM8A4020-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-12-30 16:13:00.060242

The mountain's snow season has shrunk by almost three weeks since 1965, with snowpack onset occurring later in the fall months and disappearing earlier in the spring months, according to National Weather Service data.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Dec. 24, 2025.
This winter the University of Vermont marks a quarter century of continuous research documenting two key tributaries of Mount Mansfield — the West Branch of the Little River and Ranch Brook.
After 25 years, researchers have a clearer picture of the changes in runoff on Mount Mansfield, where a warming climate continues to drive a trend of winter contraction, meaning a later first snowfall and earlier spring melt.
When UVM professors Jamie Shanley and Beverley Wemple began monitoring Mount Mansfield, they found an ideal juxtaposition for an experiment: On the one hand, the West Branch, with its anthropogenic impacts from the Stowe Mountain Resort and its development, and on the other The Ranch Brook, which has escaped the resort’s impact.
“It was kind of an ideal of a paired watershed study, where you have your control watershed — which should just march along and just be affected by climate and weather and everything — and then the developed watershed, your experimental watershed, which has all the development in it,” Shanley said.
The long-term study has offered some counter-intuitive results, including a refutation of Shanley’s original hypothesis. The West Branch has not shown evidence of the ski resort’s impact, as he had figured. Even the expected levels of chlorine from winter salt treatment were reduced after the state began introducing new stormwater runoff regulations.
“We really did not see a whole lot of effect of the ski resort on the stream chemistry or flow,” Shanley said. “We thought we might see a big smoking gun of, ‘Oh, yeah, they’re causing all kinds of problems in the stream,’ but we didn’t see a huge impact.”
Shanley and Wempel, along with UVM geoscientist Andrew Schroth and lead author Kate Hale — a University of British Columbia professor and a former UVM post-doctoral researcher — published a paper in February’s issue of the academic journal Hydrological Processes looking at the relationship between snowpack decline on Mount Mansfield, warming winters and increases in annual and seasonal runoff.
Long-term cumulative data collected by the National Weather Service at the Mount Mansfield snow stake, installed in 1954, has revealed that the snow season has shrunk by almost three weeks since 1965, with snowpack onset occurring later in the fall months and disappearing earlier in the spring months. Winter rain-on-snow events, which occur at warmer temperatures, have also increased.
This weakening of the snowpack is having under-studied impacts on the broader regions’ waterways, including an increased  risk of mid-winter flooding and summer drought.

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine has ordered a mental health evaluation for a central Iowa physician who has faced allegations of medical malpractice, chemical abuse, drunken driving and sexually inappropriate behavior.
In March 2025, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Douglas Selover of Des Moines with sexual misconduct and engaging in unprofessional conduct.
The board alleged Selover was practicing medicine in the emergency room at Des Moines’ MercyOne Hospital when it was alleged that he made unwanted sexual and inappropriate physical contact with another emergency room employee and that he made sexual remarks to the same individual.
The board has not elaborated on the alleged conduct or publicly disclosed when it was alleged to have occurred.
According to board records, Selover, who is now 68, has denied the allegations.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Recently, the board agreed to settle the case by requiring Selover to undergo a mental health evaluation that will assess “concerns about professional boundaries and sexual harassment.” As part of the settlement, Selover has also agreed to enroll in an educational course on professional boundaries and ethics.
The settlement imposes no other restrictions on Selover’s ability to practice medicine.
Previous record of ‘chemical abuse,’ drunken driving
State records indicate that in 1991, Selover was granted an Iowa license to practice osteopathic medicine subject to a consent agreement that required him to abstain from the consumption of alcohol and the use of nonprescribed drugs. As part of the agreement, Selover also agreed to inform his treating physician of what the board called his “previous history of chemical abuse.”
In 1992, the board alleged Selover violated that agreement on several occasions by drinking alcohol. The board suspended Selover’s license for 30 days and placed the license on probation for five years. The board also required Selover to abstain from the use of alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and to submit to any board requests for blood and urine testing.
Court records indicate that in February 1993, Selover was convicted of second-offense drunken driving.
In March 1996, at Selover’s request, the Iowa Board of Medicine agreed to terminate his disciplinary probation early and restored his license to full privileges, free and clear of any restrictions.
In 2003, Selover was again charged with second-offense drunken driving. Court records show the charge was dismissed when Selover agreed to plead guilty to a charge of reckless driving.
Child deaths trigger two malpractice lawsuits 
Selover is currently a defendant in two separate medical malpractice lawsuits alleging that while working in the emergency room at Des Moines’ Mercy Medical Center, he failed to diagnose and treat children with hydrocephalus, a dangerous condition that results in fluid exerting pressure on the brain.
One of the lawsuits alleges that a 7-year-old boy, Levi Miller, died after being examined by Selover in the emergency room on Sept. 14, 2022. Selover has denied any wrongdoing, and a trial is scheduled for Sept. 13, 2027.
The second lawsuit alleges that a 12-year-old girl, Mia Fidler, died after being examined by Selover in the emergency room on Sept. 21, 2022, seven days after the alleged incident with the Miller child. Selover has denied any wrongdoing, and a trial is scheduled for July 27, 2027.
The Iowa Board of Medicine has not charged Selover with any wrongdoing in either the Miller case or the Fidler case.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s second confirmed case this year of measles, a highly contagious airborne disease, has been reported in Platte County.  
The patient is an unvaccinated child with a history of travel to Arizona, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday. No further personal information was provided due to privacy issues, DHHS said.
State officials said individuals present at the following public places, on the dates provided, could have been exposed: 

Shell Creek Baptist Church in Columbus, Dec. 24, 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.


Columbus Community Hospital Emergency Department in Columbus, Dec. 29, 2 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. 

The state asks individuals at those spots to fill out a risk assessment survey. Those needing help filling out the survey or with internet access are encouraged to call East Central District Health Department, 402-562-8969.
Nebraska’s first confirmed measles case of 2025 was reported in May,  a vaccinated child in Sheridan County with no history of out-of-state travel. That was the state’s first confirmed measles case  since 2017. 
Symptoms of the disease include fever, runny nose, cough and rash. While considered a childhood disease, measles can be contracted at any age. Children under age five, adults over age 20 and non-immune pregnant and immunocompromised people are at greatest risk of developing severe complications. 
There is no specific treatment for measles. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Dec. 23, a total of 2,012 cases of measles were reported across 44 states in 2025, and three deaths were confirmed. 
This year’s number of U.S. cases reportedly is the highest annually since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000. 
Immunization is the best protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, Nebraska DHHS said in a statement. Children are to receive their first dose of measles/mumps/rubella vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age. 
The agency recommends that Platte County parents of infants from six to eleven months old speak with their health care provider to discuss early MMR vaccination.

Dan McKeon hinted that other lawmakers might be getting influenced by the governor to vote him out.,"State Sen. Dan McKeon during a press conference in Cairo, Nebraska, on Dec. 30, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) CAIRO, Nebraska — State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst tried making the case Tuesday close to home that attempts to remove him from the Nebraska Unicameral are a “political game.” 
McKeon, at the event he hosted Tuesday in central Nebraska, hinted that other lawmakers might be getting influenced by the governor to vote him out. He said people are “sick and tired of the false accusations that happen culturally” and that his colleagues jumped the gun and don’t have all the facts.
“I’ve officiated [in sports], if I’m not in the right position to make the right call … if I don’t have all my facts, and if I don’t know everything, how can I make that call?” McKeon said at Ol’ Ironsides Barbecue and Banquet Hall in Cairo. 
McKeon has been accused by a legislative staffer of making “inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” according to an incident report filed with the Nebraska State Patrol that a spokesman relayed.
McKeon and his attorney, Perry Pirsch, have denied wrongdoing by the senator, saying his actions were not sexually charged. 
The staffer’s attorney, Kathleen Neary, has noted that her client is preparing a civil lawsuit against the lawmaker. Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called on the Republican in the officially nonpartisan Unicameral to resign.

McKeon’s wife, Tracy, his daughter, Bridget, and one supporter defended him during the press conference. Bridget said, “The allegations brought against [McKeon] are not consistent with his character.”
The lawmaker from Amherst said he got his “marching orders” from the Executive Board and did everything they required him to do, including moving his statehouse office and requiring him to attend sensitivity training. 
McKeon also initially pleaded no contest to a separate misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge in Lancaster County to move forward but changed his plea to not guilty and decided to fight after the board recommended expulsion and said it was doing so “in light of a demonstrated pattern of behavior by Senator McKeon and not in response to a single isolated incident.” McKeon has said he “categorically rejects” the committee’s claim.

McKeon declined to elaborate Tuesday, under questioning from reporters, on what led him to believe the push for his removal is a “political game.” He pointed to his having been an underdog in his legislative race and that “money always talks.” 
“I think we need a breath of fresh air in Lincoln … that’s what I was trying to bring to the table … because people are tired of the political realm of things,” McKeon said. “Somebody that’s a statesman is in there, and they don’t like it.” 
He also said that if the Legislature and lawmakers move forward with this, they will be on “eggshells.” Also, he said, in his view, the governor is being a “bad official.”
“You threw the flag before you’ve even seen the damn play … what this nation needs more of is forgiveness and somebody to step up and listen,” McKeon said. 
Expulsion is the strongest disciplinary measure the Executive Board can recommend, but expelling McKeon requires a full vote of the Legislature — and the votes of 33 state senators to pass. That means the matter will likely come before lawmakers during the 60-day legislative session that begins in January.  
McKeon said he thinks he has enough support to stay in office, “but time will tell.”

Oh, and he helped the FBI solve who killed Mississippi NAACP leader Vernon Dahmer Sr.
Hollywood plans to release a movie next year on Scarpa’s role in the Dahmer case, “By Any Means,” starring Mark Wahlberg as the mobster.
The film’s producer, Alex Lebovici, who attended the 100th birthday of Dahmer’s widow, Ellie, in June, said the filmmakers are portraying Dahmer as the family man and brave NAACP leader he was. 
Dahmer’s daughter, Bettie, cooperated with filmmakers and watched them shoot scenes in Georgia. “The way the movie is portrayed, it’s not about Vernon Dahmer, it’s about Gregory Scarpa,” she said. “I have no problem with it.”
Her brother, Dennis, worries that audiences will wrongly associate his right-thinking father with the rotten mobster. “His legacy deserves to be told truthfully about who he was,” he said, “and not intermeshed with fictional characters and a vigilante justice storyline that did not happen.”

The Dahmer family regularly meets with students on the Sojourn to the Past tours to tell Vernon Dahmer’s story. Sojourn Executive Director Jeff Steinberg said he hopes publicity surrounding the film will encourage people to learn more about Dahmer. “He’s a true American hero who belongs in our history books,” he said. “He and his family inspire us all.”
On Jan. 10, 1966, a day after Black citizens learned they could pay their poll taxes at Dahmer’s store north of Hattiesburg, Klansmen firebombed his store and home north of Hattiesburg. Dahmer grabbed his shotgun and fired back at the Klansmen so that his family could escape. 
The flames seared his lungs. That night at the hospital, as he neared death, a reporter asked why he had continued to push for voting rights, knowing it might cost him his life. Dahmer replied, “If you don’t vote, you don’t count.”
A few weeks later, his voter registration card arrived. He had fought his whole life for the right of all Americans to be able to vote, but he had never been able to cast a ballot himself.
In 1964, Joseph Sullivan, known by fellow agents as a by-the-book inspector, headed up the FBI’s investigation into a different Mississippi case, the KKK’s killings of three civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, which became known as the “Mississippi Burning” case or MIBURN for short.
But as agents closed in on members of the White Knights of the KKK in 1966, they became targets. Armed Klansmen shot out agents’ windows, and one agent found a rattlesnake in his car.
Roy K. Moore, the former Marine and head of the FBI in Mississippi, decided to fight fire with fire, according to former agents. He sent in a request to the FBI to use informant NY-3461 for his operation in Mississippi. 
That informant was Scarpa, who carried the nickname, “The Grim Reaper,” because of how many people he killed for the Colombo crime family.  He had managed to dodge a bank robbery charge by becoming an FBI informant.
In January 1966, Scarpa and an FBI agent entered Byrd’s Radio & TV Service in Laurel, Mississippi. Inside they found the bug-eyed owner, Lawrence Byrd, a suspect in Dahmer’s killing. Scarpa and the agent bought a TV and asked for Byrd’s help loading it.
Once there, Scarpa and the agent shoved Byrd into the car and hauled him to a remote area, where the mobster pistol-whipped him. After that, Byrd gave the FBI a 22-page confession, which identified Cecil Sessum as an exalted cyclops in the White Knights.
Sessum confessed, too, describing how he and other armed Klansmen pumped gasoline into a dozen jugs before heading to the Dahmer home. He said the only reason he confessed was that agents beat him, made him kneel on Dahmer’s grave and put a pistol to his head. The FBI denied the claim, and the court upheld his conviction.

Juries ultimately convicted four men — Sessum, Byrd, William Thomas Smith and Charles Clifford Wilson — on murder or arson charges. Mississippi governors freed them early.
It wasn’t until 1998 that Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers was convicted of ordering the attack on Dahmer. Bowers died in prison in 2006 while serving a life sentence.
As for Scarpa, he remained a top FBI informant for much of the rest of his life. He ratted on rivals while rubbing out mob foes.
The new movie opens with Scarpa beating KKK leader Edgar Ray Killen with a baseball bat to learn the location of the bodies of the civil rights workers.
Scarpa told a similar story before his death that ABC News and other news outlets have published.
Except former FBI agents say it isn’t true. They say the revelation of the bodies’ location actually came from Mr. X, a Mississippi highway patrolman who knew the Klansmen and told Inspector Sullivan that the bodies were buried in the Old Jolly Dam. Four days later, agents found the bodies there.
In 2007, Scarpa’s girlfriend, Linda Schiro, repeated his claim, but the details she shared — Scarpa tracking down a Klansman who sold TVs, buying a TV set and threatening to kill him — describe what Scarpa did in the Dahmer case.
As for the new movie on Scarpa, Lebovici said the script by Sascha Penn and Theodore Witcher, based on the book “Deal with the Devil: The FBI’s Secret Thirty-Year Relationship with a Mafia Killer” attracted him to the project.
The screenplay appeared on the Black List, a compilation of “most-liked” scripts by film executives that had yet to be produced. “We fell for the material,” Lebovici said. “We thought it was extraordinarily compelling, such a phenomenal story.”

Dahmer’s son, Dennis, had a different reaction. He finished about a third of the script before stopping, he said. “It’s fiction. They’re creating a Black FBI agent that didn’t exist.”
After J. Edgar Hoover began directing the FBI in 1924, he fired what few female special agents there were and kept the FBI Academy from admitting Black men until 1962.
Lebovici said the Black agent portrayed in the film is a composite character, who grew up in Mississippi before moving to Chicago. When the agent returns to Mississippi, “he’s relegated to the file room, but he’s got a relationship with the Dahmers.”
In the script, the FBI assigns the agent to work as a driver for Scarpa, and the two team up to work on the Dahmer case.
Lebovici said producers plan to show the film to possible distributors next year.
Through the movie, he said he hopes viewers can glimpse the hatred of these days and wrestle with the moral question: “Is violence justified in moments like this?” 
Over the past few years, this nation has seen an increase in assassinations and other political violence, he said. “Things are getting out of control. It’s very relevant to what’s going on right now.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03132825/IMG_1674.jpg,,,2025-12-30 15:12:23.459084

(Photo: John Moore/Getty Images)A hearing on Dominion Energy’s request to block the Trump administration’s stop-work order on all offshore wind projects will be held in mid-January, a federal judge ruled.
The administration announced on Dec. 22 it was pausing leases and halting work on five major offshore wind projects under construction along the east coast, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. These include complaints that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers that support them can interfere with radar used to locate security threats.
The Richmond-based utility’s Dec. 23 lawsuit seeks to block the order for its $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project. It’s the largest of the five affected projects, all of which were expected to enter commercial operation over the next two years.
Dominion estimated CVOW would begin generating electricity in early 2026, with enough energy to power approximately 660,000 residences. In its lawsuit filed, the utility described the administration’s stop-work order as “arbitrary and capricious.”
The utility has already received all federal, state and local approvals necessary for the construction and operation of CVOW, spending approximately $8.9 billion to date, according to the lawsuit. Customers are contributing to these costs.
The lawsuit claims the pause is causing “serious, irreparable harm” to the utility and its customers.
“Our nation is governed by laws, and a stable legal and regulatory environment is essential to allow regulated public utilities … to invest and support our nation’s energy needs and associated jobs,” Dominion argued. “Sudden and baseless withdrawal of regulatory approvals by government officials cannot be reconciled with the predictability needed to support the exceptionally large capital investments required for large-scale energy development projects like CVOW critical to domestic energy security.”
U.S. District Court Judge Jamar Walker was earlier scheduled to hear the case Dec. 29, but granted the administration’s request to delay the hearing until January.
The judge ordered U.S. Department of Justice lawyers to get “classified information” regarding the stop-work order to him by Jan. 9. The hearing will now take place on Jan. 16.
Asked for comment on the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said CVOW is essential to meeting customers’ needs.
“Delaying the project will lead to increased costs for customers and threaten long-term grid reliability,” Slayton said. “Given the project’s critical importance, we have a responsibility to pursue every available avenue to deliver the project as quickly and at the lowest cost possible on behalf of our customers and the stability of the overall grid.”
The White House did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

Taylor Rogers, a spokesperson for the White House, said Trump has been clear with describing wind energy as “the scam of the century.”
“For years, Americans have been forced to pay billions more for the least reliable source of energy,” Rogers said in a statement. “The Trump administration has paused the construction of all large-scale offshore wind projects because our number one priority is to put America First and protect the national security of the American people.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For at least the next 120 days, Rhode Island has a freshly appointed federal attorney who will prosecute criminal cases on behalf of the U.S. government and represent it in civil matters.
Charles “Chas” Calenda was sworn in as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island on Tuesday morning. Chief U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. presided over the ceremony at the federal courthouse in Providence. 
Calenda, a Republican, will act as Rhode Island’s top federal law enforcement officer, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, and work across the street from the courthouse at the DOJ’s local office. 
“I am proud to be part of this team so we can keep Rhode Islanders safe from those seeking to do us harm,” Calenda said in a statement Tuesday. “I look forward to the important work ahead and will always remember that I served the people of Rhode Island above all else.”
Calenda did not respond to requests for additional comment. But he told The Boston Globe, which first reported his appointment on Saturday, that the interim term will last 120 days, or until someone is found to permanently fill the role. He also said that he will step down from his role as a West Greenwich town councilor. 
When asked Tuesday about the expected duration of Calenda’s term, Lindsay Lague, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island DOJ office, acknowledged the request but could not immediately confirm a definite timeline. 
Calenda, who earned his law degree from the University of Miami School of Law, has worked for close to two decades as a trial attorney and former prosecutor, according to the U.S. attorney’s office and Calenda’s LinkedIn. From 2006 to 2018, he worked in the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office as a special assistant attorney general, a role which saw him assist federal prosecutors on select cases. 
After litigating for the AG’s office in Family Court, Calenda worked on offenses such as sexual assault, robbery, homicide and burglary.
He also spent several years in the AG’s Narcotics and Organized Crime Unit as the lead gun court prosecutor, handling “most firearm-related felony offenses brought before the Superior Court,” according to his LinkedIn. 
After the AG’s office, Calenda worked as a trial attorney at the Coventry firm Inman & Tourgee. He began his tenure as West Greenwich town councilor in February 2024, according to his LinkedIn.
Calenda himself ran for Rhode Island Attorney General in 2022 and secured about 38% of the vote, losing to incumbent Democrat Peter Neronha’s 62%. Calenda, who reactivated his campaign finance account in October, has not commented publicly on whether he will remain a Republican contender in the 2026 race to replace Neronha, whose term ends in early 2027.
The federal courthouse and DOJ office have had a consistent back-and-forth in recent months. Multistate lawsuits filed against President Donald Trump’s administration in district court  — many of them joined or co-led by Neronha — have been parried just as often by the justice department attorneys who work across the street. 
Until now, the attorneys working in the Providence office have largely been remainders from Joe Biden’s administration, with the former president’s 2021 appointee Zachary Cunha in charge of the office until his February resignation. 
U.S. attorneys customarily leave their posts when the presidency changes. Cunha, whose resignation was spurred by a termination notice from President Donald Trump, was the last U.S. attorney among the New England states to depart his post during the presidential turnover.   
Until early December, First Assistant United States Attorney Sara Miron Bloom served as acting U.S. attorney after Cunha’s departure. Calenda said Tuesday that Bloom did “a remarkable job keeping this office stable and running for the last ten plus months.”
The Trump administration finally maneuvered to fill the role on Dec. 23, when U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered Calenda’s appointment. The interim U.S. attorney’s statement Tuesday thanked Bondi and the DOJ “for placing their trust in me to oversee this very important office.”
A copy of Bondi’s Dec. 23 appointment letter was not immediately available from either the U.S. DOJ or the Rhode Island office.
Rhode Island’s junior Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse was less happy with the appointment when it was first announced publicly, and castigated “the MAGA Department of Justice” for choosing Calenda as U.S. attorney.
“There will be no blue slip and we will be rid of him soon enough,” Whitehouse said in a statement, referring to the practice where home-state senators sign off on presidential attorney and judicial nominees via a “blue slip” form sent by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | December 2025
New Year’s Eve at Delaware Park Casino & Racing comes with a double reason to celebrate this year. In addition to welcoming the arrival of a new year, the venue is also marking its 30th anniversary with a themed celebration that rewinds the clock to 1995.
The New Year’s Eve event blends nostalgia with a full night of entertainment, offering an all-in-one celebration designed for adults looking to dance, mingle, and ring in the year in style. Guests can expect a lively dance floor powered by a video DJ, along with performers throughout the evening, including impersonators that add an interactive and playful element to the night.
As midnight approaches, a complimentary champagne toast will mark the official countdown, while a cash bar remains available throughout the celebration. The atmosphere leans energetic and celebratory, with music, visuals, and performances inspired by the mid-1990s, a decade remembered for bold pop culture moments and packed dance floors.
The celebration extends beyond the evening festivities. As part of the anniversary milestone, Delaware Park is also hosting $100,000 in slot dollar drawings throughout the day, giving guests plenty of opportunities to take part in the celebration even before the New Year’s Eve party begins.
What to Wear: 1995 Edition
The theme offers a fun excuse to reach for some classic ’90s garb. In 1995, fashion was defined by a mix of grunge, minimalist, and hip-hop-inspired styles, reflecting the music and cultural shifts of the time. Popular looks included flannel shirts layered over oversized tees, ripped or baggy jeans, crop tops, slip dresses, and relaxed sportswear like hoodies and tracksuits. Footwear leaned casual and practical, with combat boots and sneakers replacing the flashy excess of the 1980s. The overall vibe favored comfort, layering, and individuality, making it easy for guests to nod to the era without going over the top.
Whether guests lean into the look or keep it subtle, the 1995 theme adds an extra layer of fun and nostalgia to the evening.
With a milestone anniversary, live entertainment, daytime giveaways, and a midnight toast, Party Like It’s 1995 offers a spirited way to close out the year and welcome what’s next.

A former Sioux City official alleges she was fired in 2024 partly for reporting city officials’ alleged financial misconduct to federal watchdogs.
Semehar Ghebrekidan Arguello, a 30-year-old, first-generation Ethiopian-Eritrean American, Greek Orthodox woman, is suing the City of Sioux City and City Manager Robert Padmore in U.S. District Court for the Northern District Iowa for alleged retaliation and discrimination.
According to the lawsuit, Arguello was the sole staff member of the city manager’s Unit of Community Inclusion from April 2021 through May 2024, serving as a liaison between city leadership and community stakeholders on issues related to equity, inclusion and accessibility.

Throughout 2022, Arguello publicly announced and posted community inclusion events on Facebook about six months in advance of the events. Karen Mackey, the director of the city’s Human Rights Commission, then “duplicated many of these events that had been planned and coordinated by Arguello and then advertised them,” the lawsuit claims.
Arguello reported this conduct to Padmore and to City Council members, yet no corrective action was taken, the lawsuit claims. Arguello also complained to Padmore that Mackey made multiple derogatory comments about her in public settings, including remarks concerning Arguello’s age and perceived youth, her qualifications for her role, and implications regarding her religious status, according to the lawsuit.
Rather than addressing this conduct or taking corrective action, Padmore responded by telling Arguello that she needed to “get a thicker skin,” the lawsuit claims.
In February 2023, the lawsuit alleges, Mackey submitted a memo to the council claiming that the commission and Arguello were unable to work together, and attributing that alleged breakdown solely to Arguello.
During a subsequent meeting, Mackey allegedly admitted she had spoken negatively about Arguello’s age and experience in both public and private settings and stated she did not believe Arguello was qualified for her job, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit alleges that on April 26, 2023, Mackey “paid her niece to spy on Arguello at the Celebrate Diversity Carnival at Western Iowa Tech Community College.” A community member and Arguello reported the matter to Padmore and Assistant City Attorney Amber Hegarty, and the incident was “confirmed” during a subsequent investigation by an individual hired to look into the allegations, the lawsuit claims.
Lawsuit: Hitler compared favorably to Arguello
From April 2023 through October 2023, the city used an outside attorney to “investigate Mackey’s behavior,” the lawsuit alleges, although Mackey was not placed on leave or had her duties restricted during that time.
Throughout the course of the investigation, Mackey continued to make public statements disparaging Arguello, the lawsuit alleges, adding that Mackey told a school board candidate that “if Arguello and Hitler were on the ballot, she would rather vote for Hitler.”
According to the lawsuit, the investigation concluded Mackey had displayed hostility toward Arguello, spoke negatively about Arguello in public settings, paid her niece to spy on Arguello, and failed to engage in meaningful efforts to collaborate with Arguello.
Despite those findings, the lawsuit alleges, Mackey was not fired, disciplined or otherwise held accountable by either the City Council or the Human Rights Commission.
In November 2023, after Arguello informed Padmore she was pregnant and had questions about maternity leave, Padmore allegedly told her, “Now you’ll have another loudmouth in the house,” the lawsuit claims.
In February 2024, Arguello filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging discrimination and retaliation by the city based on her age, religion, pregnancy, and prior complaints regarding a hostile work environment, unsafe working conditions, and misconduct by city officials.
That month, she also submitted a complaint to the federal Government Accountability Office regarding potential mismanagement and fraud by the city involving the Housing Choice Voucher Program, the lawsuit alleges.
According to the lawsuit, Arguello alleged the city had attempted to redirect funds in a manner that could bankrupt the program and leave about 700 low-income families in Sioux City without housing. She also reported employees had “misappropriated cash or time,” and that a nonprofit organization had failed to use funds as intended, the lawsuit claims.
Arguello also submitted a written complaint to the City Council regarding the conduct of Mackey, Padmore and others, describing what she perceived to be instances of racial inequality, according to the lawsuit.
On Feb. 21, 2024, the city placed Arguello on administrative leave, alleging she had violated unspecified work rules.
The city subsequently claimed Arguello violated work rules and Iowa law, had exceeded her authority by assisting individuals with civil rights complaints, and had failed to obtain supervisory approval for certain professional actions. On May 28, 2024, Padmore fired Arguello.
Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for retaliation for reporting misconduct by city officials, pregnancy discrimination, disability discrimination, sex discrimination, and a hostile work environment.
The city, which says it does not comment on pending litigation, has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

While Alaska lawmakers passed the first significant education funding increase since 2011, the state rode a federal funding rollercoaster as funds were frozen, released, disputed and appealed. 
Western Alaska students and families also endured the devastating storm disaster of Typhoon Halong. Hundreds of students, as well as teachers, were displaced from their homes and forced to move and adapt to new schools across the state. 
Here are some of the top stories of the year:

A state education funding fight culminated when the Alaska State Legislature passed a historic override of a veto by Gov. Dunleavy to enact a boost to per student funding for K-12 schools in a one-day special session in August.

Education was the top priority of the Legislature and Gov. Dunleavy this year, and an embattled topic throughout the legislative session, with an ongoing dispute around funding for schools and education policy changes sought by the governor to address lagging school performance and test scores. 
Gov. Dunleavy vetoed two education funding bills during the session, citing a lack of policy changes he favored to boost homeschool and charter school options, and address test scores. In April, he vetoed a bill increasing the BSA by $1,000, calling it a “joke” and insisting that policy changes be included. Legislators introduced and passed another bill increasing funding by $700 per student in late April. In an effort to compromise, they included many of the governor’s priority items, including charter school changes, incentives for reading programs, and establishing an education task force to recommend further education policy changes.

Dunleavy vetoed the education funding increase out of the final budget in June. The legislature came back in August to override the veto. It was the first time since 1987 that Alaska lawmakers have overridden an appropriations veto by a sitting governor. 
School officials said the additional $50.3 million in per student funding, known as the base student allocation, is essential to help maintain class sizes, hire and retain teachers, and create stability for students.
“We’re extremely excited. A lot of our administrators were texting and very excited about getting it overturned today, so that made Valdez very happy,” said that city’s school superintendent, Jason Weber, in August after the veto override vote. 

The Trump administration froze millions in funding for Alaska schools, later releasing some funds. But Alaska is also embroiled in an ongoing dispute with the U.S. Department of Education around impact aid, which could cost the state $80 million

Over the summer, as school districts grappled with uncertainty around a state funding increase, the Trump administration announced a freeze of over $46 million in funds for Alaska schools, including for instruction and migrant education programs, which support students who miss class due to seasonal work like fishing. The Anchorage, Fairbanks North Star Borough, and the Kuspuk school districts joined a nationwide lawsuit challenging the withholding of congressionally approved funds as unlawful.
“These are not extras. These are the programs that give our students a chance,” said Kuspuk School Superintendent Madeline Aguillard. “When the federal government walks away from its obligation, it is not a delay. It is denial. Denial of access. Denial of progress. Denial of the futures our students have a right to pursue.”

In late July, the federal government released $5 billion of the $6.8 billion in K-12 funding.
The state is involved in an ongoing dispute with the U.S. Department of Education, which claims the state has failed a disparity test – allowing no more than a 25% gap between the highest and lowest funded schools. The state has appealed the finding, with over $80 million in federal impact aid at stake. A decision is expected in 2026. 
The Trump administration also froze more than $6 billion in congressionally-approved funding for adult education and workforce development funding in July. In Alaska, it prompted immediate cuts to programs and staff layoffs. The state had been awarded over $1.1 million in grants last year, and the frozen funds in July were a shock to programs and students that included GED classes, literacy and civic education, English language classes and workforce development. 

Hundreds of students, as well as teachers, were displaced by the devastation of Typhoon Halong from Western Alaska and relocated to schools around the state.

The devastation of Typhoon Halong forced an estimated 2,000 residents to evacuate Western Alaska communities in the largest mass evacuation in state history, and education officials across districts worked quickly to re-enroll students and provide support services at schools across the state. 
More than one hundred students relocated to Bethel, remaining in the regional hub of Western Alaska and the Lower Kuskokwim School District. An estimated 140 students enrolled in the Anchorage School District, which worked to keep storm displaced students together, including enrolling a number of students at the Yup’ik immersion program at College Gate Elementary School. ASD also provided transportation from emergency shelters, health services, meals and translation services for Yup’ik speaking families.  
“They’re going through trauma and it’s going to take a lot of work. But we’re going to put that in, because these kids are worth it,” said Anchorage Superintendent Jharrett Bryantt at an Oct. 21 school board meeting. “And they deserve a wonderful education that we want to offer them, in ASD, for as long as they’d like to be here.”
Other students re-enrolled in schools where they relocated across the state, including in Nenana and Fairbanks areas, the Kenai Peninsula, Matanuska-Susitna Valley Borough, as well as boarding schools like Mt Edgecumbe High School. Teachers and staff displaced by the storm also were re-assigned, with the majority staying in the Lower Kuskokwim School District, according to the superintendent. 
Many of the district’s 22 village schools also served emergency shelter to residents as Typhoon Halong hit, and as relief centers in the days and weeks after the storm as the recovery effort got underway.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-30 18:10:33+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi awarded over $200 million in initial federal funding for rural health,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/30/mississippi-fed-fund-rural-health/,"Awards were made to all 50 states as a part of a five-year, $50 billion federal investment into rural health care.","Mississippi will receive nearly $206 million in the 2026 fiscal year as a part of a federal program that aims to transform rural health care and offset budget cuts that could harm rural hospitals.  
Awards were made to all 50 states as a part of a five-year, $50 billion federal investment into rural health care. The amounts average $200 million and range from $147 million to $281 million. Texas and Alaska will receive the largest shares of funding, while Connecticut and New Jersey were granted the smallest amounts. 
“Today marks an extraordinary milestone for rural health in America,” said Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz in a Dec. 29 press release. “Thanks to Congress establishing this investment and President Trump for his leadership, states are stepping forward with bold, creative plans to expand rural access, strengthen their workforces, modernize care, and support the communities that keep our nation running.”
The funding program was tacked on to President Donald Trump’s tax-and-spending law passed this summer, which is expected to result in significant losses to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas. Congressional Republicans added the one-time money for rural health to soften the blow associated with the cuts. 
Half of the $50 billion program is to be distributed evenly among all states with approved applications. Awards for the other half of the funding were determined based on a formula that calculated states’ rurality, the quality of its application and implementation of several policies aligned with the White House’s Make America Healthy Again agenda.
Mississippi has recently taken steps to adopt policies that receive higher scores, including reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test in schools and seeking a waiver to restrict purchases of sugary foods and drinks through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in October.
An estimated $137 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending are expected in rural areas over 10 years, meaning Rural Health Transformation Program funds will offset roughly a third of those cuts, according to analysis from KFF. 
More than half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are at risk of closing, according to a recent report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Hospital leaders have warned that the federal cuts could force more rural hospitals to stop some services or close their doors altogether. 
In Mississippi, cuts to state-directed payments, which help hospitals offset low Medicaid payments, will amount to a loss of $160 million a year statewide beginning in 2029, Mississippi Medicaid Director Cindy Bradshaw told lawmakers in September. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released application summaries on Dec. 29 submitted by each state.
According to the summary, Mississippi’s plan consists of six initiatives: 
A statewide rural health assessment will refine investment strategies and align critical rural health needs with funding after a review of data and stakeholder input.
To improve emergency response, coordination of care after discharge and access to behavioral health services, the coordinated regional integrated systems initiative will integrate emergency medical services, hospitals, public health and social services into regional healthcare districts.
A workforce expansion initiative includes retention awards, residency expansion, preceptor development, early-career outreach and “Earn While You Learn” programs to recruit, retain and train clinicians, allied health professionals and support staff.
The health technology advancement and modernization and telehealth adoption and provider support initiatives will modernize health internet technology and advance telehealth infrastructure, cybersecurity and consumer-facing tools to improve efficiency, coordination and access.
The building rural infrastructure for delivery, growth and efficiency initiative will address capital investments, psychiatric emergency services and care gap closure. It will include pilot programs for early intervention, Autism Spectrum Disorder-focused, care management and value-based care programs, and capital investments will be aimed at expanding facility capacity and specialized services.
No subawardees have yet been awarded as a part of Mississippi’s plan, according to the summary. Agreements will be established when the project is implemented and may be formed with rural hospitals, federally qualified health centers, primary care clinics, community health centers, technology and telehealth vendors, universities and professional associations. 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, whose office oversaw the development of Mississippi’s plan, unveiled the state’s plan at a Nov. 4 press conference but did not release its application or application summary to the public, like most other states. Mississippi is one of four states that did not publicly release documents pertaining to its plan, and many states released full or partial application documents, according to data from KFF last updated on Dec. 23. 
Reeves’ office denied Mississippi Today’s public records request for the application, saying the requested records “appear to be confidential under Federal law” until awards are made, citing the same document that says states may post plans to their websites at their discretion. 
It also pointed to a state law that exempts public bodies from the Mississippi Public Records Act’s deadlines during procurement. The law does not bar the state from releasing the records, but says it is not required to meet the usual deadlines until contracts are awarded.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/05232823/3X0A6440-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-30 13:12:03.187918

Wyoming Freedom Caucus member allegedly admitted that ‘he drinks while driving for anxiety,’ Johnson County Sheriff’s Office report says. 
The post Rep. Bill Allemand arrested for drinking and driving appeared first on WyoFile .","Rep. Bill Allemand, R-Midwest, was arrested over the weekend and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, court records show. 
A Johnson County Sheriff’s Office deputy pulled over Allemand at about 12:30 p.m. Sunday at the Millers Travel Center in Buffalo for suspicious driving, according to a police report. 
After the officer found an open can of beer in the center console alongside four unopened beers and a loaded pistol on the front passenger seat, Allemand admitted to drinking two beers 15 minutes before the stop, according to the report. 
The “driver also admitted that he drinks while driving for anxiety,” Deputy Caleb Campbell wrote in the report. 
Before being pulled over, Allemand had “started from a stop almost striking a vehicle approaching from the West,” according to the report. He then allegedly stopped abruptly prior to impact. 
Allemand failed a field sobriety test and “had significant difficulty getting in and out of patrol vehicle requiring Deputy to support the driver as to not let him fall,” the report states. 
Allemand did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by press time. 
Since 2023, Allemand has represented House District 58, which encompasses a central section of northern Natrona County. He is a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of Republicans who won control of the House in 2024.
In the 2025 legislative session, Allemand sponsored a successful bill to clarify in state statute that gunning prairie dogs and some other species from trucks is legal on private land in Wyoming. 
Allemand has been a staunch opponent of a proposal to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Bar Nunn. Ultimately, California-based Radiant Industries, citing Wyoming’s ban on spent nuclear fuel waste, scrapped its plans near Bar Nunn and said it would build a manufacturing plant in Tennessee instead.
A jury trial has been set for May 1 following Allemand’s arrest, court records show. 
A portion of the police report is illegible. A message left with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office records personnel was not returned by press time.

According to the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals, Elaina Riley of Des Moines has been state-licensed social worker since 1996. Recently, the board charged Riley with violation of a rule that requires licensees to protect the confidentiality of client information.
According to the board, it received a complaint alleging Riley disclosed confidential information about a client, resulting in Riley’s “ex-spouse leaving inappropriate messages on the client’s phone.”
The available board records don’t indicate when the alleged offense took place or what motivated Riley’s ex-spouse to contact the client.

The board says it also received information indicating a client of Riley’s believed they shared a “friendship” outside of the counseling relationship, and that the client and Riley had had dinner together a few times throughout their multiyear relationship.
Riley denied sharing with others any confidential client information and denied having any sort of social relationship with a client or having dinner with the individual, according to the board.
Riley and the board recently settled the case with Riley agreeing to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program and to complete 12 hours of educational training focused on maintaining appropriate boundaries with clients and best practices in safeguarding client confidentiality.
In 2012, the board charged Riley with engaging in impermissible professional conflicts of interest, professional incompetency for a failure to exercise the degree of care which is ordinarily expected of social workers, professional incompetency for a failure to conform to minimum standards for social workers, and violating a rule or regulation related to the practice of social work.
In the 2012 case, the board alleged Riley provided clinical services to a minor client in 2010 and failed to report the suspected abuse of her client as required by law. In addition, the board alleged Riley engaged in personal email conversations with her minor client, exchanged gifts with the client, and permitted the minor to “negotiate guidelines for the therapeutic relationship, which restricted (Riley’s) communication” with the child’s parents.
According to the board, Riley also contacted her minor client after their social worker-client relationship ended without the permission of the minor’s parents, and also failed to inform the parents of her concerns for the child’s safety.
The case was resolved with a 2013 settlement agreement that resulted in Riley’s license being placed on probation for one year. As part of that settlement, Riley agreed to complete 10 hours of educational training focused on ethics and maintaining appropriate boundaries with clients.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)The U.S. Postal Service has adopted a new rule that could create doubt about whether some ballots mailed by voters by Election Day will receive postmarks in time to be counted.
A USPS rule that took effect on Dec. 24 says mail might not receive a postmark on the same day the agency takes possession of it. The postal service says it isn’t changing its existing postmark practices and is merely clarifying its policy, but some election officials have looked to postmarks as a guarantee that mail ballots were cast before polls closed.
The new rule holds implications for 14 states and Washington, D.C., that count ballots arriving after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before that day — commonly called a “ballot grace period.” In these states, ballots placed in the mail by voters before the deadline may not be counted if the postal service applies a postmark after Election Day.
The USPS rule says that “the postmark date does not necessarily indicate the first day that the Postal Service had possession of the mailpiece.”
Voting by mail faces uncertain moment ahead of midterm elections

The USPS rule comes as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to consider a case that could eliminate ballot grace periods nationwide. The court’s decision, expected late this spring or next summer, could render the issues raised by the postmark rule moot.
Mail-in voting surged in 2020’s general election amid the COVID-19 pandemic, when 43% of voters cast their votes by mail. The percentage of voters mailing their ballots has fallen from that peak but remains above pre-pandemic levels. About 30% of voters cast mail ballots in 2024, according to data gathered by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
While the vast majority of mail ballots were successfully cast last year, hundreds of thousands weren’t counted. During the 2024 election, 584,463 mail ballots returned by voters were rejected by election officials — 1.2% of returned mail ballots. About 18% of those ballots were rejected because they didn’t arrive on time.
The USPS defended the change in a lengthy response to criticisms published in the Federal Register. The agency emphasized that it does not administer elections and doesn’t advocate for or against voting by mail.
The postal service repeated its advice that voters mail their completed ballots at least a week before Election Day. And it noted that voters may request a manual postmark at their local post office free of charge.
“If customers are aware that the postmark date may not align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of a mailpiece, they will be better equipped to adjust their plans accordingly,” the response reads.
“And if policymakers or other entities that create rules utilizing the postmark date are aware of what the postmark date signifies, they are better equipped to determine whether their rules adequately serve their purposes.”

WILMINGTON, Del. — A Wilmington native with deep roots in Delaware’s schools, music programs, and Scouting community is earning national recognition with a credit on the new film Anaconda, now playing in theaters nationwide.
Brendan Moriak is credited as an orchestrator on the film’s score, working as part of the music department on the Sony Pictures release, which opened Dec. 25. The movie is a meta action-comedy reboot of the 1997 cult classic and stars Paul Rudd and Jack Black as two friends whose attempt to make their own low-budget remake of “Anaconda” turns into a real fight for survival in the Amazon.
Moriak’s journey into professional film music began in Delaware. He started his education in the Christiana School District, where he was first introduced to music at a young age. His interest deepened through formal training at the School of Rock in Hockessin/Wilmington, where he performed publicly and collaborated with other young musicians while developing skills in ensemble performance and arrangement.
Outside the classroom, Moriak was active in Scouting and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in Troop 50, reflecting years of leadership, service, and commitment.
He later attended Salesianum School, where he became a member of the marching band and took on leadership roles in student-led music projects, including serving as a music director. Those experiences helped shape his interest in large-scale musical coordination and storytelling through sound.
After graduating from Salesianum in the Class of 2018, Moriak enrolled at American University, where he demonstrated a growing talent for music composition. After graduation and a lifetime of preparation, he immediately moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film music.
Like many young artists starting out, Moriak faced significant challenges early on. After arriving in California, he slept on a friend’s couch while working to establish himself professionally and save enough money to afford an apartment.

“He was betting on himself,” Chris Moriak, father, said of the move. “There was no guarantee — just the belief that the work would eventually speak for itself.”  Chirs Moriak added “a speical thank you to everyone who in Delaware who contributed to inspiring and support Brendans dream”.

For “Anaconda,” the film’s score was composed by David Fleming, whose work established the musical themes and emotional framework of the movie. Moriak’s role as an orchestrator placed him directly in the creative process of bringing those ideas to life.
In film production, orchestrators translate a composer’s themes and sketches into fully realized arrangements for orchestra or ensemble. That work includes assigning musical lines to specific instruments, balancing sound across sections, and preparing scores and parts for recording sessions. Orchestrators work closely with the composer and respond to the director’s vision for how music should support tone, pacing, and storytelling.
Moriak’s work helped bridge Fleming’s compositions with the direction of filmmaker Tom Gormican, ensuring the final score aligned with the film’s blend of comedy, action, and creature-horror.
“At the box office, ‘Anaconda’ opened to a mid-tier performance during a crowded holiday release window, finishing its opening weekend in the national top five.”
For Wilmington audiences, Moriak’s credit on the big screen at the end of the movie represents more than a name in the closing titles. It reflects a high-level creative role within a major studio production — and a hometown success story rooted in Delaware classrooms, community programs, and local stages before reaching movie theaters across the country.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Moriak-Delaware-LIVE.png,,,2025-12-30 11:59:23.771112

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Students who lack fully-developed social skills are a common target for bullies. By giving educators the tools to better teach communication and socialization, a University of South Carolina researcher hopes to help reduce bullying — and the violence that comes with it — across South Carolina’s K-12 school system.
Professor Chad Rose heads the newly formed Bullying Prevention Center within USC’s College of Education. He brings with him 20 years of experience training teachers and parents, and putting research-backed, antibullying programs to work within school districts. By better preparing teachers to stop bullying behaviors early in a child’s school years, he hopes to protect children while also reducing teacher burnout in the Palmetto State.
“The main reason why teachers leave the profession is because of challenging behaviors in the schools and either a lack of training or lack of support in addressing challenging behaviors,” Rose said.
Bullying, he added, is often in the center of these struggles.
While this fall marked the second consecutive school year of declining teacher shortages in the state’s public schools, there were still 706 reported vacancies at the start of the semester.
“So I’m hoping that this center can not only support schools but also help with teacher retention,” Rose said.
How it works
Rose started his career as a high school special education teacher in Indiana. He said most students he worked with had a behavior disorder, making them more vulnerable to bullies as well as more prone to respond with violence and aggression. He’s spent two decades since then studying the causes of bullying and the best ways to prevent it.
“I was interested in hopefully making our school safer, especially for youth with disabilities,” he said. “At the heart of everything that I do is really school violence prevention.”
What Rose’s studies found is that social and communication skill deficits are the biggest predictors of bullying.
“The first thing that we have to do is we have to recognize that our schools are not just a place for learning academics. Our schools are a place where kids learn how to socialize,” he said. “So, our interventions are grounded in teaching kids these critical social skills that not only help prevent bullying but also help improve lifelong outcomes.”
In his 12 years working at the University of Missouri, Rose founded a center that grew to a team of 20 people. K-12 schools across the country could contract with the center’s team. The group went into a school, assessed instances of student-on-student violence and made a plan for the school to follow.
The center has worked with districts including Miami-Dade County Public Schools in Florida, the third largest school district in the country, and Milwaukee Public Schools in Wisconsin, one of the nation’s most racially and economically diverse.
On the Missouri-based team were college students studying to become teachers. After training under Rose, they worked in classrooms as teams of two, teaching lessons designed to practice social skills, such as decision making, cooperation, conflict resolution, emotional regulation or setting boundaries.
This could include asking students to work in small groups on a math problem.
Not only were students asked to solve the equation, but they had to do so as a team. The teacher gave examples of what that cooperation should include. Then, as students worked, the teaching team walked around offering praise whenever a student showed signs of teamwork. Beyond just saying “good job,” the teachers gave compliments highlighting the specific action or behavior that fell within the social skill they were trying to teach.
Now, he’s bringing that same model to South Carolina.
What’s next
Rose said teachers aren’t always trained to recognize and reinforce these social skills during classroom lessons. That’s what the center offers, both to working teachers and teachers in training who will study under Rose at USC.
Teachers can choose to participate in training, in person or virtually, through the center as part of the professional development and continuing education they need to maintain their teaching license.
School districts can also choose to partner with the center, either paying the center as a consultant or taking part in research studies run by the center.
A pair of federal grants, totaling $8 million, will support the center’s work over the next four years. The center also earns revenue when it books contracts with districts.
Rose hopes to have half a dozen people on staff at the end of the spring semester and grow from there, eventually bringing undergraduates onto his team the way he did in Missouri.
In addition to offering training through the center, Rose also has been in talks to bring the Say NO Bullying Festival to South Carolina. The annual event, which for the past 10 years has taken place in Los Angeles, brings in celebrity speakers and performers to raise awareness.
Rose said he also wants the center to celebrate great things schools are already doing.
“That’s a twist on how people approach bullying prevention,” he said. “We don’t talk about those things that are working. We talk about those things that are broken.
“But there are some schools out there, some administrators, some teachers, some parents that are doing amazing things to prevent bullying,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bullying.jpg,,,2025-12-30 11:11:48.837282

Laura Kelly announced Monday. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced allocations to states as part of the $50 billion program set up by Congress as part of the “big, beautiful” law passed in July.
Funds initially were expected to support rural hospitals and medical facilities that would be jeopardized by changes to federal health programs that are expected to increase the number of uninsured people nationwide and decrease Medicaid funds. 
However, the program transitioned to focus on rural health in general, and each state submitted a plan on how it would use appropriated dollars.
Half of the funds are to be distributed evenly among all states and the remaining half were distributed based on the submitted plans. The fund is set up to operate from fiscal years 2026 through 2030, with $10 billion being distributed each year. 
Kansas received the sixth-highest amount among the states at $221 million.  
“This funding for Kansas will go a long way in fundamentally changing the health care delivery system for rural communities across the state,” Kelly said. 
The Kansas plan set five priorities: expand primary and secondary prevention programs; secure local access to primary care; build a sustainable rural health workforce; enable value-based care; and use data and technology, a state news release said. 
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment will serve as the lead agency for the grant. 
The Kansas allotment will be awarded for 2026, the first year of the five-year program, which focuses on identifying the root challenges facing rural health providers, said a news release from U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican.

Gov. Mike DeWine doesn’t see it that way.
Despite there being more than 600 unique public school districts in the state, hundreds have spoken to us, testified at the Statehouse or rallied for more support from the state.
“We continue to lose money and costs to operate the district continue to rise,” Parma City Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt said.
And the schools all have a similar complaint.
“We are not being fully funded at what it costs us to educate children,” Elyria City Schools Superintendent Ann Schloss said.
This then leads to stress and burnout.
“We’re bleeding our schools dry,” Columbus City Schools teacher Joe Decker said.
All year, we’ve told you about the challenges that educators like Decker have faced.
“I’ve had classrooms from 42 to 26 kids, I think,” he said, talking about overcrowding.
Districts tell us they have dozens of new regulations, with fewer resources.
“Schools have to be more precise in their spending,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said.
Nonpartisan research group Policy Matters Ohio found that the state slashed the expected public education spending by nearly $3 billion over the next two years.
“Are we doing right by public schools right now?” I asked DeWine in a one-on-one interview.
“I think we are, but look, it’s a continuing process,” the governor responded. “We have to continue to do right by them, as you say, because these are our kids, and this is our future.”
DeWine has split from some members of his party, arguing for better funding of schools. He has also vetoed some legislation that would take even more dollars away. But he still signed massive cuts to expected funding into law, while giving one billion of taxpayer dollars to private schools.
“We have to give people choices,” the governor said. “Some people are in situations where they don’t believe the school fits their child or they don’t believe the school is doing a very good job.”
Schools argue that it’s a catch-22 — when districts get less funding, they will perform worse and have less to offer. Lower-performing schools complain they can’t get better without funding.
“Taking away money from our public schools is demoralizing our public schools, is demoralizing our students and just cutting them 1,000 times over and over,” Decker said. “It is heartbreaking to watch day after day.”
But DeWine points out his successes, like how literacy has increased statewide.
“There are a lot of good things going on with education in the state, but we just have to do more, and we have to continue that process and then move forward,” he said.
Although DeWine has shown that he has attempted to prevent a bad situation from getting worse, he isn’t doing enough, Decker said.
“What could having a fully funded classroom change for you?” I asked Decker.
“It is a world of difference when you have an educational safe space the way it was intended to be,” the teacher said.
But right now, the Republican supermajority in Columbus shows no sign of changing course on school funding.

For some Delawareans, the New Year does not truly begin until they have sprinted into icy water surrounded by cheers, laughter, and a whole lot of adrenaline. Each winter, cold-water plunges across the state invite the brave and the curious to kick off the year with a literal splash, blending tradition, community spirit, and a memorable challenge.

Republish photo only with original article.)Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has tapped leadership for the new Ohio Election Integrity Commission. As part of last summer’s budget, state lawmakers axed the state’s existing independent campaign watchdog and replaced it with a new office under the secretary’s control.
As of Jan. 1, the Ohio Elections Commission hands the reins to the Ohio Election Integrity Commission. The board’s membership shrinks from seven to five, and instead of a bipartisan panel selecting a nonpartisan colleague, all commissioners will be chosen by state leaders.
To start, former Ohio Supreme Court Justice Terrence O’Donnell will lead the commission on an interim basis, after which former U.S. Attorney D. Michael Crites will take over. Crites previously chaired the Ohio Elections Commission after getting appointed to the panel by Gov. Jon Kasich.
Under existing law, Crites couldn’t serve on the new commission immediately because he’s already part of a different state board. Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation lifting that restriction in December, but it won’t take effect until March.

“Justice O’Donnell is one of the most respected jurists and legal minds in Ohio,” LaRose said in a statement, “and I’m honored that he’s agreed to give of his time in retirement to continue serving our state in this interim capacity.”
“His experience will help immediately restore the commission’s credibility,” he added, “as he leads its formative days.”
How we got here
At root, state lawmakers criticized the Ohio Elections Commission for moving too slowly. Even frivolous allegations, they complained, drag on for months if not years, placing demands on candidates’ time and creating fodder for their political opponents. For all that time and energy invested, eventual punishments often seemed meager in comparison.
Meanwhile, the commission was just as slow to address significant, well-known examples of campaign finance violations like former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder’s activity to advance Ohio House Bill 6.
“I mean, they’ve had an OEC complaint pending against Larry Householder for five years,” state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said back in April as he led the charge to eliminate the agency.

In November, the commission again delayed taking action on those complaints.
“This dereliction of duty has potentially allowed criminal behavior to go unpunished,” LaRose said at the time, “and it sends a disgraceful message to Ohio’s citizenry that the enforcement of our election laws is feckless and toothless.”
When the commission handed down a $400 fine in December, LaRose dismissed it as “another weak slap on the wrist,” adding “time’s up, OEC. Good riddance.”
The new commission
Majority and minority leaders in the Ohio General Assembly are responsible for selecting members of the new Ohio Elections Integrity Commission and the Secretary of State taps the chair.
Ohio Senate President Rob McColley selected Karl Kerschner, an attorney who began serving on the Ohio Elections Commission in 2024. Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio nominated Eben “Sandy” McNair, an attorney who previously served on the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn designated John Lyall, another member currently serving on the Ohio Elections Commission, to continue on the new commission. House Speaker Matt Huffman has not yet selected his designee.
Interim chairman O’Donnell said he was “honored” for the opportunity to serve on the commission.
“I would hope to instill public confidence in Ohio elections,” he said, “to ensure compliance with campaign finance laws, and to work with my colleagues on the commission to achieve those goals.”
O’Donnell first joined the bench in 1980 on the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. He went on to serve on the state appeals court before getting appointed to the Ohio Supreme Court in 2003. He won elections to continue serving on the supreme court three times before retiring in 2018.
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Crites, who’ll take over the chairmanship in March, but got no reply. In addition to his experience as a federal prosecutor and former chair of the Ohio Elections Commission, the secretary described him as a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and Vietnam War veteran who reached the rank of Captain before retiring from the U.S. Navy. Crites currently chairs the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame executive committee.

(Submitted photo from Jessyca Vandercoy)TOPEKA, Kan. — Social workers nationwide directed furious complaints toward their national association, demanding accountability, transparency and an external review of finances in the wake of a structural realignment that jettisoned 14 state-level leaders.
Four state chapter boards of directors resigned in protest and other state leaders wrote letters to the National Association of Social Workers board of directors after it announced the reorganization in November.
In South Dakota, the chapter’s board told members that whistleblowers alleged “harmful dynamics” at the national office, including questionable spending and a “troubling” consolidation of power.
“These communications raise serious concerns about governance and ethical practices within the Association,” the chapter said in a letter to members.
The letter encouraged social workers to reach out to the national board and ask for a vote of no confidence in NASW CEO Anthony Estreet. Estreet was selected in 2023 to become the organization’s CEO, after serving on the board for several years.
A letter from the Michigan NASW chapter was equally blunt.
“It is our duty to keep NASW leadership accountable to the core values we hold as social workers, including integrity, transparency, accountability, and collaborative governance,” the letter said. “At this time, the NASW–Michigan Board finds that these standards are not being upheld, and our unanimous vote of no confidence reflects serious and ongoing concerns.”
The letter listed issues that include quality and transparency of national leadership communications and lack of meaningful response to issues raised by chapters.
Letters from Rhode Island, Kansas, Kentucky and Texas were written in the same vein, and each asked for an accounting from the national organization about restructuring decisions and failure to communicate clearly. Several demanded an external investigation.


Online outcry
Unrest among members of the National Association of Social Workers spawned numerous online posts and the creation of social media accounts. They include the following.

An Instagram account called “investigatecorruptionatnasw.”


Multiple active Reddit threads, including NASW whistleblowers are back.


A Substack post from Arkansas social worker Angela Campagna, who said, “The resignation of the NASW Arkansas Chapter Board exposes something deeper than organizational fracture it reveals the growing tension between the daily reality of frontline social work and the structures meant to represent us.”


An in-depth look at the situation on The Macro Lens, called “Deafening Silence: NASW Restructuring and the Fear of Speaking Up.”



LaToya Evans, an external communications expert hired by NASW, said an investigation is not planned.
“Investigate what?” she said. “Like, no one’s giving me any proof of anything. What are we going to investigate? What are we going to do?”
Concerns raised
In October, the NASW’s treasurer and compliance officer, Sylvester Bowie, sent an email to members saying he had received correspondence “raising concerns about sensitive organizational management and operational issues.”
“The board takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously and is committed to oversight of the organization,” the email said. “The Board will promptly review relevant information and determine what additional steps, if any, are necessary to address the financial concerns raised, as well as any other allegations within the Board’s scope.”
In response to Kansas Reflector questions about unrest within the organization, Evans referred to annual financial audits by an independent accounting firm.
“NASW has also been audited annually for the past two decades by an independent firm, and they continue to have clean audits with no evidence of financial mismanagement,” she said.
Most financial audits do not uncover fraud, which is typically found when tips are received, according to the National Council of Nonprofits.
“There was no formal internal investigation per se, but a committee did look into the allegations in letters. Dr. Estreet was never under any investigation,” Evans said. “This is false.”
‘No proof’
Evans said the whistleblower letters referred to by boards were unsigned and contained no specific allegations to investigate.
And she said no proof of any financial mismanagement or other issues has been shown to the national board of directors.
“Have you seen it? You haven’t. Because, if you’ve seen it, please furnish it for me. Because if people are writing all these letters and they’re saying financial mismanagement, no one has said one plus one equals five,” she said. “No one has a receipt, no one has a copy of anything. Because typically when someone is saying financial mismanagement, they have documentation of it.”
With no proof, the allegations being made by state chapter members are upsetting and don’t make sense, Evans added.
“It’s a lot of unfounded claims of people who just want to complain,” she said.
In an email to membership Dec. 8, the NASW board pointed members to audits of the organization’s annual financial statements that found no problems and directed them to access the 990 financial forms required to be filed by nonprofit associations.
Demanding accountability
An online letter asks social workers to sign on to demand the national organization become more transparent and accountable. The author of the letter is unclear, but it lays out numerous questions signees would like to see answered, including a section on NASW financials.
Data in the 990s shows that from 2014 through 2020, NASW “experienced persistent operational deficits,” but that began to turn around in 2021, the letter says.
“We recognize the seriousness of these long-term financial challenges and acknowledge the need for strong corrective action,” it says. “It makes sense that there were conversations nearly a decade ago about restructuring.”
Financial patterns beginning in 2021 showed that “day-to-day operations have been stable and largely sustainable for the last several years,” the letter says. In 2023 and 2024, there were major increases in liabilities and a decline in assets.
“These types of shifts are typically caused by non-operational financial events, such as legal or insurance-related obligations, recognition of contingent liabilities, related-party financial impacts, and accounting reclassifications or corrections,” the letter says. “These events are national-level issues, not chapter-level failings. It is therefore essential to understand the true drivers of the restructuring decision.”
The letter asks that the board and Estreet, the CEO, schedule a virtual open forum so members can ask questions.
Evans said board president Yvonne Chase has scheduled a meeting with volunteer chapter presidents.
“They invited her to chat and she is doing that while also planning other town halls and listening sessions,” Evans said. “Dr. Estreet previously had a town hall with members and staff after the reorganization announcement.”

Restructuring
NASW announced the structural realignment a few weeks ago, eliminating 14 state leader positions and merging some states together to be overseen by one director. Kansas leader Becky Fast was laid off and the state’s chapter is now grouped with Iowa.
The leaders who were let go, some of whom oversaw two chapters, covered Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; Georgia; Guam; Kansas and Oklahoma; Kentucky; Missouri; North Dakota; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Utah; Virginia and Washington, D.C.; and Washington and Hawaii.
A letter signed by Arkansas chapter board members, all of whom resigned, said the decision to remove state leadership failed “to uphold principles of transparency, accountability, fairness and responsiveness to community needs.”
Jessyca Vandercoy led the Nebraska NASW chapter for 18 months before she resigned, citing concerns about the direction the national organization was going and decision-making transparency.
It was her dream job, she said, especially the opportunity to follow the social worker code of ethics, which has a mandate for social and political advocacy.
Vandercoy was part of a council of chapter executives, a small group of chapter leaders who worked with the national organization. She said they were tasked with giving feedback about the model that put one executive director over two states, which has now been implemented.
Although the group found benefits to the model, it raised concerns about whether states would have advocacy at a strong enough level to support local chapters, among other issues, she said.
Those issues were not addressed, and she was upset when the national board chairwoman sent a letter saying they had “rigorously vetted and planned for” the new structure, Vandercoy said.
Instead, there was no open communication about the concerns raised by chapter executives, she said. One concern was the importance of having a person working in the state who is able to attend legislative hearings and to build relationships with state officials.
“This is not something to take lightly, because the relationship between the social workers in the state and our executive director is absolutely essential to get policy passed, even to know what social workers want in that state,” Vandercoy said.
‘A difficult time’
Evans said the reorganization that resulted in the combining of chapters is a process that’s been in the works for 10 years, part of NASW’s attempts to modernize its structure.
“Nearly three dozen chapters have been reliant on Chapter Development Funds, meaning they are not financially independent and need additional financial support from membership and national revenue to meet basic operational and chapter goals,” Evans said. “To continue being a national resource for social workers, the move to a Dual Chapter (executive director) model became financially necessary.”
Chapter executive directors, though, argue that some of the consolidated chapters were on strong financial standing and had funds in accounts that will now be rolled into the national organization.
As stories ran nationwide about NASW’s restructuring and how upset social workers were, NASW issued a Dec. 8 communication that some felt missed the point.
“While we acknowledge that this is a difficult time for NASW, we are confident that we are moving in the right direction,” board president Chase wrote in an email to members. “We intend to keep all members and staff aware of any additional changes and will continue to keep transparent, ethical, and honest communication at the forefront. Actions from Board meetings are regularly posted on the NASW website once available.”
Evans said NASW will be able to reduce spending in areas where there are financial deficits but still provide organizational resources, especially in chapters where states have fewer than 1,000 members.
Insurance problems
The restructure set afire smoldering tensions that began more than a year ago.
In September 2024, Preferra Insurance Co. Risk Retention Group, which offered discounted professional liability insurance to NASW members, filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., courts, where NASW is headquartered.
The lawsuit named NASW and its two subsidiary insurance companies.
Preferra alleged the three entities violated contracts that managed the way the three businesses worked together.
In case documents, Preferra also said NASW CEO Estreet and chief financial officer Sekou Murphy didn’t understand the insurance regulatory environment. The result was a disagreement between the companies about how dollars paid to NASW through the insurance program would be calculated, the filings said.
At the same time, Preferra discovered Estreet failed to disclose his criminal record while seeking approval for a seat on the company’s board.
“Preferra subsequently learned that Dr. Estreet has a criminal conviction for burglary as well as licensing issues that he did not disclose to Preferra and thus were not included in the application to (District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking), which requires such information to be disclosed,” the Preferra case complaint said.
NASW filings denied Preferra’s accusations, calling it a “work of fiction, intended solely to obscure the misdeeds of (Preferra CEO) Anthony Benedetto.”
Benedetto also served as CEO of NASW’s insurance companies until early in 2024, when he was dismissed, NASW said. The nonprofit’s attorneys accused Benedetto of abusing his position.
NASW said its CEO and chief financial officer asked questions about Preferra’s consolidated audited financial reports, which Benedetto and his team refused to answer.
Ultimately, the two companies settled the lawsuit and parted ways, filing a dismissal in court on July 31.
AM Best, a national insurance rating company, in October placed NASW Insurance Co. “under review with negative implications status,” according to the Insurance Journal.
The review was issued because of uncertainty regarding NASWIC’s prospective business plans to operate on a stand-alone basis,” the Journal reported.
In November, Preferra announced it was teaming up with the Council on Social Work Education to offer insurance with discounts for social workers.
NASW is developing a new product in 2026 to provide social workers with professional liability insurance at a discounted rate and membership benefit, Evans said.

Estreet’s history
As the Preferra case played out in court, social workers from around the country learned about Estreet’s criminal history. They were concerned he may not have disclosed it to the board, and many said they didn’t feel as if the organization’s leadership was transparent about what was happening.
Evans said the board did a background check on Estreet before he was hired and was aware of his criminal history, which happened when he was “practically a teenager.”
Brenda Rosen, who led the Kentucky NASW chapter until being let go in November, said that as a social worker, she believes strongly in and works with many people “living in recovery.”
She and two other social workers Kansas Reflector spoke with emphasized that they have no issues with someone who has a criminal history.
“I have so much respect for people who live in recovery, or who have committed a crime, paid their time, and are giving back, if you will, to society by being social workers,” Rosen said. “So when I say that this guy, the CEO, was being dishonest about his felonies, I take that really seriously because to me, the ethics are own it. Own it. Name it and highlight the good things you’ve done. Don’t make it look like somebody else is attacking you. Be honest.”
As social media posts percolated online, NASW’s board made a statement in September 2024 in support of Estreet and national staff.
The NASW board encouraged members to engage in “constructive and honest dialogue and to rely on official communications from NASW and its chapters for accurate information about the organization.”
What’s next?
NASW members are demanding accountability, and they’re hoping for stronger communications, Vandercoy said. It’s concerning that social workers may drop their membership over the situation. But the organization won’t go away, she said.
“I think in a lot of ways, NASW is too big to fail. They hold our code of ethics,” Vandercoy said. “They issue standards of practice that are rooted in research and evidence, which is also part of our code of ethics, so that, I think, continues to exist. So what does it become?”
Vandercoy was uncertain of the answer, but she is seeing states tackle the issue on their own as they are losing faith in their national association. In Nebraska, she’s been contacted by several people interested in starting some local work outside of NASW.
“For me, I’m not going to spend any time being — probably the wrong words, but jaded or angry at what’s happened,” she said. “There is too much important work to do.”

They ranged from the most local debates over zoning or health care services in a particular community to the oxygen-sucking moves by a president whose first year back in office commanded nearly nonstop headlines as he broke with one norm after another.  
Here are five topics that stood out.  
A call for civil debate 
Beyond showdowns on specific issues, what has loomed large in politics in recent years has been the way we debate contentious topics, or, more to the point, the way we don’t actually engage in meaningful debate. Disagreement over issues today often devolves into something more akin to grade-school name-calling. This degradation of discourse starts at the top. But Donald Trump’s unhesitating use of juvenile taunts and unchecked invective, not reasoned argument, is both a cause of the coarsening of public debate and a consequence of the turn away from more civil exchange of ideas that was already underway when he launched his first campaign.  
Offering a desperately needed antidote to that, Jim Peyser, who served as education secretary under Charlie Baker, gave our readers a civics class in how to talk about thorny topics. Through a series of more than a dozen essays, Peyser set out to frame how to think about and weigh competing arguments on issues where, he says, things are often a lot more gray than black or white. “The goal is not to confuse or paralyze,” he wrote, “but to acknowledge and clarify the inescapable trade-offs in public policy (i.e., second-best and less-worse options) and to encourage humility, civility, and even empathy in our public discourse and decision-making.” 
We took note of Peyser’s essays in our rundown of notable 2024 op-eds, but he continued his essay-writing with more pieces in 2025, and we thought his plea to steer away from the toxic vitriol that animates so many debates was something we can’t hear too often. His concluding essay in the series, published in October, includes links to all the essays. You can also hear Peyser talk about these issues on a recent episode of The Codcast.  
We also heard calls for grace and civility in our public discourse in essays this year by communications professional Colette Phillips, who sits on CommonWealth Beacon’s advisory board. Meanwhile, Lane Glenn, the president of Northern Essex Community College and a MassINC board member, eloquently made the case for freewheeling debate and civil discourse in this September essay. “We are at a moment when extremists on both the left and the right use strategies ranging from public shaming and cancelling, to censoring and intimidating not just to disagree with the opposition, but to silence them — sometimes permanently,” he wrote following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.  
The precarious state of health care
From the soaring cost of health care to the dire shortage of primary care providers, the state’s vaunted health care system is showing lots of signs of strain, and federal cuts to research and Medicaid are only adding to the troubles.  
Paul Hattis, who co-hosts the Health or Consequences episodes of The Codcast, and Eileen McAnneney started the year by calling on Gov. Maura Healey to go big on tackling health care costs.  
Dr. Eric Dickson, CEO of UMass Memorial Health, said the system is drowning in unnecessary administrative costs for both providers and insurers, while we pay too little for primary care, a reimbursement structure that inevitably leads our country’s health care system to be dominated by high-cost specialists. Blue Cross Blue Shield CEO Sarah Iselin pointed to the cost of drugs and medical care as culprits. Alan Sager, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, pushed back on Iselin’s prescription and said incremental, piecemeal reforms won’t do the trick. He said we’re spending more than enough right now to provide quality care to all, but we need to radically reshape how it’s spent.  
As the year wound down, in an essay that served to bookend the call he and Eileen McAnneney made at the start of 2025, Hattis said it was hard to feel optimistic that state leaders are ready to make the hard choices needed to get the health care system onto firmer footing. “There was no coherent roadmap, no shared strategy, and certainly nothing resembling a statewide plan,” he wrote about a November meeting of the state Health Policy Commission.  
The uncertain road ahead for K-12 education 
In the world of K-12 education policy, voters had their say last year, approving by a wide margin a ballot question that did away with the requirement that students pass the 10th grade MCAS exam in math, science, and English to graduate from high school. That decision has, in many ways, only underscored the sense of drift that some saw in the state’s schools, where achievement gains have been flat or falling and there is considerable fatigue with the education reform measures that promised to close a yawning achievement gap.  
In February, as the state began to consider new graduation requirements in place of MCAS, Kevin Cormier and Chris Marino of Teach Plus Massachusetts urged leaders to adopt new requirements focused on student outcomes, not simply inputs like a set of course requirements. Kerry Donahue, director of Teach for America Massachusetts, said the state must set a high bar for graduation and stick with it.  
Earlier this month, after the state panel developing new graduation requirements issued an interim report this month, Mary Tamer, of the education nonprofit MassPotential, said the end-of-course assessments the report proposed would be crucial to maintaining uniform state standards and accountability for student performance.  
In a sign of the vigorous debate that’s likely to unfold in 2026, Lisa Guisbond of Citizens for Public Schools wrote that the proposed use of end-of-course assessments would move in exactly the wrong direction. She said voters called for a turn away from state-administered standardized tests. 
Beacon Hill’s closed-door ways  
One storyline that seems to endure year after year is calls for greater transparency on Beacon Hill, where legislative leaders maintain a tight grip on which bills see the light of day and seem to agree only grudgingly to changes aimed at opening up the lawmaking process. Aaron Singer, a Walpole filmmaker working on a documentary on the issue titled “Shadows on the Hill,” cast some light on the Legislature’s top-down ways.  
At a time of political polarization, frustration with the way the Legislature operates seems to be one thing that unites those on the left and right.  
In March, a trio of progressive activists, Jonathan Cohn of Progressive Massachusetts, Peter Enrich of Progressive Democrats, and Scotia Hille of Act on Mass, pointed to at least one glimmer of hope for improvement: new reform-minded rules adopted for the Legislature’s 2025-26 session. In August, Jennifer Nassour, a former chair of the Massachusetts Republican Party, member of the bipartisan Coalition to Reform Our Legislature, and current MassINC board vice chair, decried the lack of transparency on Beacon Hill while spotlighting the same hopeful move on the internal rules governing how bills are handled. She cautioned, however, that the Legislature still “has a long way to go.”  
Earlier this month, Jonathan Cohn and Scotia Hille pointed out just how far, writing that for roughly half of the nearly 9,000 bills analyzed by the new Beacon Hill Tracker website, lawmakers had broken at least one of the new rules put in place to promote greater transparency. “[I]f legislators are looking for a New Year’s resolution for 2026,” they concluded, “here’s a good one: follow your own rules.”  
Putting a human face on health insurance bureaucracy   
Politicians are fond of invoking the maxim that “policy is people.” It’s often used to describe how a law or some government or business policy ultimately affects real people in their lives, either for good or ill. Perhaps nowhere does that play out with more at stake than in health insurance, where lives are on the line and costs that are not covered could quickly bankrupt many families.  
In September, Kendra Winner, a Winchester mother of two, made this poignantly clear in an essay about her son Aidan, who, two years ago at age 18, suffered a traumatic brain injury that has left him unable to speak or walk.  
“[A]s if that agony weren’t enough,” she wrote of Aidan’s injury, “I’ve also been forced to wage another relentless battle — this one against a cold, indifferent private health insurance industry that treats my son like a number instead of a life worth fighting for.” She described the roadblocks she has faced, the bureaucratic hoops she has been forced to jump through, and the coverage denials and appeals she filed, all in a parent’s quest to secure the right medical care for her child.  
Knowing too well from her family’s painful odyssey how policy is people, Winner outlines changes state lawmakers could enact — reforms already in place in other states — to help all those dealing with catastrophic brain injuries. “Today, I fight for him to live a life beyond survival,” she wrote about Aidan. “He deserves that chance. All brain injury survivors do.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top_5-Opinion.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-30 09:57:17.407440

The iron-rich terrain spans two million square miles of mixed-grass and sandsage prairie across Barber, Comanche and Clark counties along the Oklahoma border, but it doesn’t have a historical fire culture like the Flint Hills to its east. When rancher Bill Barby prepared to conduct his first prescribed burn in 2014, there was pushback.




Cowboys of Conservation
A series of articles exploring the relationship between cattle ranching and grassland conservation in Kansas. Grazing culture, from Indigenous tribes to the earliest settlers, was instrumental in both shaping and preserving the prairie ecosystems that define the state.
Part one: “The single greatest conservation threat” of our lifetime
Part two: Bill Sproul, the Flint Hills, and community-based conservation
Part three: Bill Barby, developing a culture of fire in the Red Hills
Part four: Out west, an exportable conservation model in Smoky Valley Ranch




“I called into the dispatch to tell them we’re getting ready to ignite, and she goes, ‘permission denied,’ ” Barby said.
“I didn’t call to ask your permission,” Barby told the dispatcher. “I called to tell you I was getting ready to light a fire.”
The fire was enormous, he said, largely because of the presence of thousands of eastern red cedar trees that have come to dominate the Red Hills, also known as the Gypsum Hills. Six times, the dispatcher threatened to send fire trucks to extinguish the blaze, despite Barby’s efforts to convince her it was under control.
“Finally, the fire chief came out and sat on the hill with me, watching,” Barby said. “He says, ‘You guys really know what you’re doing, don’t you?’ I said, ‘Yeah, we do.’ ”
Fire culture in cattle country is reciprocal. Before his first burn, Barby traveled two counties over to join the Gyp Hills Prescribed Burn Association and spent years helping them, just to learn the ropes. In turn, they helped execute his first burn. Now, Barby leads a local burn cooperative of nine ranches.
Neighbors who said they would never burn, or were even openly hostile to the practice, now ask Barby to show them how, he said.
Fire, along with the grazing of herd animals, was a fundamental aspect of prairie’s evolution, and controlled burning has taken on a newfound urgency as woody species transform the landscape. Woody encroachment is threatening to collapse the grassland ecosystem and render the landscape unusable for cattle ranchers. Historically, fire kept woody species in check.
Bill Barby’s burning regime and rotational grazing of cattle has resulted in pastures full of healthy, warm-season native grasses. Barby said the changes to the landscape after burning resulted in a “night and day difference.” (Photo by Erin Socha for Kansas Reflector)
Now, the lack of regular fire is making wildfires worse. Eastern red cedar trees are extremely flammable and act as ready tinder, said Jesse Nippert, a distinguished professor of biology at Kansas State University who studies woody encroachment.
“You can manage a grass fire really easy,” Nippert said. “It’s difficult to manage a woodland fire, and as these woodlands are all around our cities, it has the potential to burn down our cities.”
Nippert pointed to the destruction in Stillwater, Oklahoma, where a recent wildfire was associated with cedar proliferation.
“Stillwater, Oklahoma, nearly burned to the ground,” he said.
Researchers at K–State, he said, have “done a risk assessment of Manhattan, Kansas. If we had a strong south wind and those cedars catch, something like 75% of Manhattan would burn to the ground.”
In 2017, the Starbuck wildfire burned more than 700,000 acres across Kansas and Oklahoma, consuming homes, cattle, and everything else in its path. At least one person died. A downed power line combined with dry conditions, high wind, and ample kindling in the form of eastern red cedar trees created the largest wildfire in state history. Barby’s entire ranch burned.
After the fire, however, the Cimarron River, which runs through the ranch, stopped drying up.
“We had the same amount of rain, or less rain, but the river ran,” Barby said. “In the past, we’d go dry the Fourth of July till Thanksgiving.”

The river stays flowing about seven years out of 10, now, he said. The Starbuck fire, it turns out, grew so intense that it was able to kill many of the invasive Tamarisk, or salt cedar, trees that multiply along the riverbank. The destructive species, like eastern red cedar, was planted for wind breaks, and now takes over riparian areas. Each tree consumes up to 200 gallons of water each day, dramatically altering streams and water tables.
“My most productive land is where the densest salt cedar was,” Barby said, but removing it wasn’t something he thought he could accomplish, because the costs of removal were too great.
“The land wasn’t even valued that high,” he said.
The salt cedar, which had been spreading for more than 50 years, was such a dense monoculture that controlled burns couldn’t beat it back.
“We could burn up to that salt cedar, and then it would just go out because there’s no fuel,” he said. “But in ’17, when (the Starbuck fire) came through with such intensity, it burned up a lot of it. It opened it up so much, and we had so much more warm season grass come out. We’ve actually increased our carrying capacity by about 50 cows.”
Barby said that his burn schedule has moved from invasive species control to ecological management. Now, he burns on an 8- to 10-year schedule, to thin out woody species and give grass room to grow. The transformation of his prairie, he said, was remarkable.
“It’s opened that canopy out, we had (more) grasses, it was beautiful. It was just a night and day difference,” he said.

Barby’s stewardship has earned him recognition as a leader of grassland conservation in the state. In 2024, he was awarded the Sand County Foundation’s Kansas Leopold Conservation Award for the work he has done restoring the 3,700-acre ranch to a healthy ecosystem for both his cattle and the wildlife. The ranch is home to threatened species such as lesser prairie chickens, whooping cranes, and Arkansas river shiners. Barby takes great pride in the biodiversity of his ranch.
“Songbird populations are an indicator of soil health,” he said, noting that ecologists who surveyed his land found it supported more species than other ranches in the area.
He has practiced rotational grazing since 1985, long before “regenerative grazing” entered the lexicon. At any given time, only 10% of Barby’s ranch is used by cattle, which he rotates between fenced parcels called paddocks. Each acre sees about 36 days of grazing per year, resulting in long periods of rest and rejuvenation. Barby keeps a spreadsheet detailing the grasses growing in each paddock, which allows him to estimate their production capacity.
Last year, Barby entered into a voluntary land protection agreement with the Nature Conservancy that will protect his ranch from development in perpetuity. The conservation easement is part of the Nature Conservancy’s Generational Grasslands initiative.

The initiative is working to protect the few remaining intact grasslands in the southern high plains, said Matt Bain, Kansas director of conservation for the Nature Conservancy. Ranchers, Bain said, are leading the way in conservation, and the Nature Conservancy works to support their efforts.
“What it boils down to,” Bain said, “is that landowners, like Bill, they’ve worked their entire lives to put this ranch together, to get it into the shape that it’s in. They love it dearly and want to make sure that it stays a working ranch forever.”
The land protection agreement allows the Nature Conservancy to help landowners achieve their long-term vision for their properties, Bain said.
Barby also has set up a succession plan that involves passing off the day-to-day operations of the ranch. It took him three years to find land managers who share his ecological goals. With these pieces in place, Barby’s family can continue to maintain ownership of the ranch after he’s gone, and his environmental vision can continue to flourish.
Barby said he loves cattle ranching, but what he loves most is the land.
“I love the grass and the soil,” he said. “I love just making it healthy, and it rewards you so well for doing that. It’s not like a secret recipe or anything, right? I guess you have to care.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bill-Barby--1024x686.jpg,,,2025-12-30 09:57:17.407440

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Iowa lawmakers prepare to come together once again for the legislative session, beginning in January, those involved in higher education have turned their eyes to the academic offerings of community colleges and public universities, building on conversations that began last year.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, has maintained his role as chair of the House Higher Education Committee after its creation last legislative session. While the Iowa Senate has no committee specifically for higher education in the state, Education Committee Chair Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said there are a few topics in the area he “would encourage people in both chambers to focus on.”
“We’re looking forward to another very productive session,” Collins said.
Proposed changes to community college degree programs
Much of the interest in higher education from lawmakers for the upcoming session revolves around community colleges and the potential expansion of their offerings to students entering programs designed for high-demand careers.
Both Collins and Evans said they’d like to see community colleges, especially those in places without four-year colleges and universities, offer baccalaureate degrees in areas including health care, education, manufacturing and more.
Community Colleges for Iowa, the state’s association of community colleges, conducted a study exploring the pros and cons of bringing bachelor’s degree programs to the institutions at the request of lawmakers last legislative session. The report found that with additional state support, community college control over what programs are offered and the faculty and capacity to make new programs work, having community colleges offer bachelor’s degrees could provide more access to education for place-bound Iowans and strengthen the state’s workforce.
Collins said he found the report “really informative,” and he’s heard from community college presidents and governing board members that expanding degree options at community colleges would be especially positive for rural areas like those in southern Iowa. He added he will introduce legislation this year to make bachelor’s degrees at community colleges a reality.
“This really isn’t an experiment. Iowa would be joining 24 other states who already offer community college bachelor degrees, in high-demand fields like nursing, teaching or business,” Collins said. “It would really be a great benefit for the areas of our state that are in a higher education desert.”
Property taxes, eminent domain debate to return in 2026 Iowa legislative session

Community colleges are a “hidden gem” of Iowa that Evans would like to see the state do a better job of promoting, he said — not only the education they provide to Iowans, but the ways they can improve Iowa’s workforce and economy, especially in the areas of health and education. It wouldn’t be a very difficult lift to turn RN programs into BSN programs, he said, and as long as efforts are targeted toward needs shown by Iowa Workforce Development and its data, community college bachelor’s degrees could help keep students in Iowa and working in much-needed jobs.
Evans said he wants programs to be implemented in a way to not cause undue competition between community colleges and public and private universities. Collins, however, said he believes that any competition to come out of changes to degree offerings would be “the result of egos being put front and center, rather than the students who could stand to benefit from this.”
With the “great level of cooperation” between the community colleges, private colleges and public universities, Collins said he doesn’t see these changes as creating direct competition. He said “a totally different type of demographic of student,” like those who are place-bound, is being targeted, and mainly in areas of high demand where programs at other institutions might already have waitlists.
Plans for more academic program, core curriculum review
In addition to bachelor’s degree programs at community colleges, Collins said he will introduce “a number of study bills” during the first week of the 2026 legislative session, and plans to bring in presenters to meet with the higher education committee and dig into issues it is exploring.
The Iowa Board of Regents conducted a review of academic programs and their alignment with state workforce needs this year, after lawmakers discussed passing legislation to require such a review last session. While Collins said he was impressed with the report itself, he was disappointed the board didn’t take any action to eliminate low-performing or low-enrolled programs.
As a result of this lack of action, Collins said the Higher Education Committee will “be taking a hard look at spending on certain academic programs this year,” like those relating to social justice and gender studies, and redeploying funding from them to high-demand fields like nursing and teaching.
Evans, who said he hasn’t read the report but is “eager” to go over it, said it’s no secret that higher education is expensive and lawmakers need to look at workforce needs and align them with degrees students pursue, whether they are at a public or private institution.
“We want to make sure that our students are directed to degree programs that have a job waiting for them, especially a job waiting for them here in Iowa,” Evans said. “We have a number of sectors that are growing in our state that we need to be pointing our best and brightest towards and doing it at a reduced cost, or at least the most efficient cost we can for parents and students.”
Echoing previous comments, Collins said he also plans to continue conversations started last legislative session around core curriculum, which he described as “a disaster right now.” In efforts to return Iowa public higher education core curriculum to the “true liberal arts education that it was meant to be,” Collins said he will introduce legislation to require three credit hours of American history and American government.
A bill that didn’t make it through the process to become law last legislative session would have codified general education requirements at Iowa’s public universities, with the inclusion of Western and American Heritage course requirements. As for work involving diversity, equity and inclusion activities on college campuses, Collins said the key now is to ensure the laws are followed and enforced.
“It’s my expectation that the laws we passed are followed, and if not, the Legislature is happy to take more corrective action to ensure that they are followed,” Collins said.

New California laws taking effect on Jan. 1, 2026 expand coverage for in vitro fertilization, regulate artificial intelligence, protect renters and more. 


Most of the hundreds of new California laws that are set to take effect on the first day of the new year won’t change your life. They’re adjustments to existing laws and directions to state agencies to follow up on past priorities.
But some of them might have a profound effect on you or a loved one 
Know someone who’s struggling to conceive? One new law requires more insurers to cover in vitro fertilization. 
How about someone who’s thinking about what to do after high school? Another new law compels more California State University campuses to offer automatic admission to seniors who meet their requirements.
Some new California laws are meant to confront some of the major questions of the moment, including how to regulate artificial intelligence and whether the state’s Democratic leaders can contest the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.
In all, lawmakers passed 917 bills in 2025 and Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 of them.

The upshot was a barrage of laws designed to curb tech harms but often in watered down form.
Take San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Weiner’s legislation to keep artificial intelligence systems from enabling catastrophes like biological weapons attacks. The original version would have mandated safeguards over AI systems and imposed possible liability on their developers.Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed it amid concerns that it would stifle innovation in the state’s booming AI industry. This year’s version, signed into law, merely requires big AI companies to publish safety frameworks and creates a pathway for reporting safety incidents.
Similar dilutions occurred over other tech proposals. Of various bills to regulate data centers, those mandating disclosure of water and power use failed while one merely letting regulators look into those uses passed. On AI chatbots talking to kids, a bill outright banning any harmful chats failed while one just requiring protocols for suicidal users became law. A similar process winnowed six bills to regulate algorithmic pricing down to one signed by the governor, forbidding tech platforms from requiring their business customers to use their pricing recommendations.
That came after another year of aggressive lobbying by tech companies, sometimes behind the scenes.
Still, advocates for more regulation won some outright victories, including a new browser setting to forbid websites from transferring personal data. Experts say this “opt out” will end up helping consumers across the U.S. 
Meanwhile, California’s executive branch struggled with the process of guarding against online hackers, losing its top cybersecurity official amid discord in the office that position oversees. Law enforcement agencies across the state also struggled to correctly handle the digital data they collected, with many local police departments illegally sharing information on vehicle movements, gleaned from automated license plate readers, with federal agencies like Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
2026 outlook
Next year will see no end to the tension between protecting Californians from artificial intelligence and the impulse to protect the flow of money into the industry. An ambitious bill requiring disclosure of AI use in consequential decisions, such as in housing and education, will return. Data centers will stir controversy as AI spikes their power use, potentially opening the door to nuclear power. Lastly, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have drawn up proposals — thus far not acted upon — to preempt state laws regulating AI.

Beginning Jan. 1, landlords will be required to provide all apartments with a working stove and refrigerator thanks to a new state law.
It marks the end of an unusual, decades-long phenomenon mostly in the Los Angeles area where some tenants have had to buy their own appliances after signing a lease.     
The law, Assembly Bill 628, takes effect Thursday, and of the numerous housing reform measures passed by the Legislature in 2025, is one of the more unusual ones.
“A working stove and a refrigerator are not luxuries,” Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, a Democrat from Inglewood, said in a statement earlier this year after she introduced the bill. “They are a necessary part of modern life.”
California has the fewest available apartments with refrigerators in the country, according to a 2022 report from the Los Angeles Times that was cited in the bill proposal. There is not a clear reason why, and the mysterious trend is largely region-locked to Los Angeles and Orange counties.
Most tenants don’t have to buy their own bulky appliances. But California law previously required only plumbing, heat and certain other utilities be available. Apartments without the staple appliances will now be illegal unless they are part of housing with communal kitchens, single-room occupancy units or hotels.
Tenant rights groups say the law will help reduce housing costs for low-income residents who have to pay for a refrigerator — which can easily run in the hundreds of dollars — in addition to the first month’s rent and a deposit before moving in.
“To have an added cost of trying to buy a refrigerator and a stove is really economically unfeasible for many tenants,” said Larry Gross, executive director of the Los Angeles housing advocacy group Coalition for Economic Survival.
Realtor groups have said it will spur burdensome litigation for mom-and-pop landlords. 
The requirement “will lead to heavier burdens on the courts and a dramatic reduction in the state’s availability of rental housing supply,” Bernice Creager, a lobbyist for the California Association of Realtors, said at a Senate judiciary committee hearing earlier this year.
Enforcement will be up to local governments. In Los Angeles, residents will be able to file a complaint with the city’s housing department if a landlord refuses to provide cooking and refrigerated storage appliances.
Tenants can still bring their own refrigerator and stove if they please, but they will be on the hook for maintenance if they do.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120825-Refrigerator-IS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-30 08:57:21.413583

In 2025, devastating California wildfires in LA became the state’s most destructive. Climate goals faced federal opposition as Trump blocked clean-car mandates. Refineries closed, water conflicts intensified, and legislators passed compromises.


Days after 2025 began, two fires scorched through Los Angeles neighborhoods, the most destructive in California’s history. The Eaton and Pacific Palisades fires also renewed attention to issues such as utility oversight, insurance coverage, and the broader challenges of wildfire planning in a changing climate. And their harms rippled outward, leaving thousands of low-income workers and immigrants without jobs. 
But California found pushing its climate agenda forward to be an uphill battle this year: Ambitious climate goals faced  a hostile federal government economic pressures. 
Anticipating opposition from President Donald Trump, state leaders chose to abandon important clean-air rules before he even took office, including plans to phase out diesel trucks and transition to cleaner trains. Nearing mid-year, Trump and his allies in Congress blocked the state’s clean-car mandate, a blow to emissions reduction plans.
Nevertheless, as part of budget negotiations, Gov. Gavin Newsom sought to reauthorize California’s landmark cap-and-trade program, launching a debate that would resolve in the final hours of the legislative session. 
Blaming climate and environmental regulation, Phillips 66 and Valero followed through on plans to shutter oil refineries, raising concerns about gas prices and the future of the state’s oil industry. In Wilmington, Phillips 66 is now closed. A high-profile explosion at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery nearby underscored persistent safety and environmental risks tied to remaining facilities. 
By the end of the legislative session, these issues converged, as legislators passed a six-bill deal that included a plan to boost oil drilling, relief for ratepayers who fund wildfire mitigation, and an extension of the now rebranded “cap-and-invest” program.  
As lawmakers passed sweeping reforms to California’s landmark environmental review law, critics warned exemptions may make it easier for potentially high-polluting advanced manufacturing facilities to take root in already vulnerable areas. 
Longstanding conflicts over water continued to simmer this year. The governor continued pressing to fast-track a $20 billion tunnel around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to send more water south — to the outrage of Delta lawmakers. And dry conditions led to dire projections for the Colorado River, a vital water supply for Southern California. They ramped up the tensions — and the urgency — as negotiators from states that rely on the river tried, and failed, to reach a deal portioning out water supplies.
2026 Outlook
Affordability, the cost of climate adaptation, and pollution harms, in the skies and in the waste stream, continue to be key issues for California. As Gov. Gavin Newsom’s balancing act continues, the state will navigate tensions with environmental justice advocates unhappy with compromises. Emerging risks include the cost – in energy and water – of data centers, and the environmental consequences of the battery economy.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010925_PalisadesFire-After_TS_CM_43.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-30 08:57:21.413583

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)“Forever chemicals” seeping into drinking water, a federal shift in public lands and the historic inclusion of New Mexican downwinders in a federal restitution program all led the news cycle this year.
Issues of climate and public health shaped the state’s political landscape in 2025. All year, Source NM covered the intersection of the climate and public health. The stories documented profound impacts at the local, state and national levels.
“What we do to the climate, to the atmosphere, to the land or water, we do to ourselves,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, wrote in an email to Source NM. “Fines are rarely, if ever, issued to companies polluting New Mexico’s air, land, and water while risking public health and climate.”
These issues are felt acutely in New Mexico, where state leaders have sought to earn the state a reputation as “a national leader in clean energy.” Here are the year’s top environmental and health stories, as reported by Source NM.

Regulating ‘forever chemicals’
Like many states across the nation, New Mexico has worked to mitigate the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS or “forever chemicals.”
The Environmental Protection Agency has said that exposure to the chemicals may cause cancer. The EPA last year set a 2029 deadline for public water systems to comply with new drinking water requirements.
New Mexico officials in August sought to end a dispute over monitoring PFAS levels in the water aquifer under Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis. Testing found the “forever chemicals” in the blood of nearly 600 people in the area.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this year signed legislation that tasked state environment officials with creating laws to phase out consumer products with intentionally added “forever chemicals.” 
The New Mexico Environment Department in October proposed PFAS rules to the state Environmental Improvement Board. At the time, department officials said public hearings could be scheduled as early as February.
100 measles cases in 6 months

New Mexico logged its first measles case of the year — the third such case since 2021 — in February. But it didn’t stop there. 
By May, state health officials warned of possible exposures in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. The state’s congressional delegation promptly called on Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. to address the crisis.
After logging more than 100 cases over six months, state officials declared an end to the outbreak in September.

A federal shift in land policies

During a turbulent year for the federal government, federal agencies unveiled plans that marked a shift in land policy for the Western U.S. and New Mexico, in particular.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in August solicited public feedback on its plans to repeal a ban on constructing roads on U.S. Forest Service land, which had ramifications for 1.6 million acres in New Mexico.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) opposed the plans, saying at the time: “The bottom line is that when we build new roads in protected areas, we risk more fires, not fewer.”
The “roadless rule” was not the federal government’s only target this year. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in September said the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule — which seeks to give conservation of public lands due consideration along other uses such as timber, grazing and recreation — stood in the way of oil and gas development.
New Mexico’s congressional delegation called on Burgum to reverse course on plans to remove federal protections around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
Compensation for downwinders

For the first time, the federal government included New Mexican downwinders in its Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act. The law, passed in 1990, sought to give restitution to people who fell ill following exposure to radiation and uranium. Until this year, though, it excluded New Mexican downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners.
U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) had advocated for their inclusion every year since first winning federal office in 2008. The RECA fund briefly expired in 2025, but bipartisan efforts to restore and expand the restitution finally succeeded when U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri included it in President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill.
The deadline to apply for RECA compensation is Dec. 31, 2027, according to Heinrich’s office. The U.S. Department of Justice anticipates its online filing portal will be operational by the end of this year.
Data center’s effects on water and air

Some residents say the scope of the project still wasn’t clear when Doña Ana County commissioners in September approved $165 billion in bonds for a development with a number of generically named LLCs — including Red Chiles LLC and Green Chile Ventures LLC — on the project application.
County officials approved the bonds for what is now known as Project Jupiter, a massive campus of data centers planned to support tech companies like OpenAI and Oracle.
Since then, documents have revealed how developers plan to build natural gas generating stations to power the project, prompting concern over whether it will comply with the state’s clean energy law.
Developers have asked state officials to approve permits that would let it emit as many greenhouse gases annually as New Mexico’s two largest cities combined, Source NM was the first to report in December. The state environment department subsequently ruled that the permits were “incomplete” and gave them until Jan. 19 to provide more information.
The applications for air quality permits must go to a public hearing if a member of the community requests one, a spokesperson for the state environment department said. Such a hearing has yet to be scheduled. 
Toxic metals found in groundwater

Martin Zamora on the right (R-Clovis) around her property where recent tests discovered contaminants in the groundwater. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
Two New Mexico state agencies in November told Mora County residents to test their private wells after discovering high levels of toxic metals in the area’s groundwater.
The metals — antimony, arsenic and uranium, all of which threaten the kidneys, skin and cardiovascular and nervous systems — were the same ones found in firefighting foams that crews used to combat the massive Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire.
Residents and New Mexico leaders, including Democratic U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, quickly pointed to the blaze as a likely source of the contamination and called on the federal government to respond. 
Officials overseeing the approximately remaining $2 billion in federal compensation for people affected by the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire responded by saying they’d consider addressing the water contamination if victims could prove “injuries and causation.” Leger Fernández, in response, said FEMA “should create a protocol to quickly address these claims.”
“If [the metals] are a consequence of the fire, it is my belief that they should be covered by the Hermits Peak money that I secured for these claims,” Leger Fernández told Source NM at the time. “And we need to make sure that FEMA reads the report to understand that this is not naturally occurring contamination and that they are heavy metals that come from the fire suppression efforts.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pueblo-Bonito-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-30 08:57:21.413583

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)People sentenced to life in prison in Alabama may receive parole.
But the almost 1,200 Alabamians who have done so are on supervision for the rest of their lives; are required to pay a $40 monthly fee and can lose their freedom for slightest infraction, even if they remained trouble free for decades.
“We are talking about people who have been released, the parole board reviewed their files, determined they were safe to release, and they have been out in the community,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a nonprofit that focuses on criminal justice reform. “They have been granted parole. And they are revoked and sent back under these flimsy circumstances.”

Their circumstances  were described in a November report from Alabama Appleseed titled “Taking a Life,” which looks at those who released from prison after life sentences.
The report profiles five parolees who the report says lived without incident after their release, some for decades, only to find themselves reincarcerated for violating a condition of parole or an arrest that may not have resulted in a charge. Both could put them back in prison for life.
Archie Hamlett, 53, was sentenced to life in prison in 1995 after a jury convicted him of trafficking marijuana. He spent 22 years at Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer before he was granted parole in 2017.
The report described his life after prison as a “steady series of achievements,” including obtaining a commercial driver’s license; starting a trucking business; renovating a house, and restoring vintage vehicles.
But according to the report, Hamlett was pulled over in January and detained after law enforcement learned of his criminal record.
Hamlett, who suffers from a documented medical condition requiring him to urinate often, felt nauseous and requested that he be allowed to use a portable urinal that he stored in his truck. Officers refused. Hamlett then had to choose whether to urinate on himself or relieve himself in the dark. He chose the latter and was charged with public lewdness and booked into the Madison County Jail.
“I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful,” Hamlett said to the officer that was detailed in the report. “I had to use the bathroom. I have a medical problem and I had to use the bathroom bad. I had a medical urinal, but they wouldn’t let me use it. I used the bathroom outside.”
The parole board revoked his parole and sent him to prison to serve out the rest of his life sentence until he, once again, is eligible for parole in March.
“And because of this one episode that happened late, one freezing night, he is now in Easterling prison, and that is such a waste,” Crowder said.
The report notes that Hamlett isn’t unique among parolees in building a new life after release. Bennie Haggins was convicted of first-degree robbery in 1983 and sentenced to life in prison but paroled in 1991. He remained on parole for 33 years and earned a pardon in October. During that time, he reported to this parole officer every month and paid the $40 monthly fee to the state of Alabama.
Haggins worked at Sterilite Corporation in Birmingham until he retired in 2012, then volunteered at the Salvation Army. Eventually he joined the Emergency Disaster Services team, getting sent to locations affected by natural disasters.
“When I look back, I destroyed my whole life, but God blessed me with the opportunity to get it back,” Haggins said in the report. “I took full advantage of it and tried to help as many people as I could help, and I haven’t stopped.”
Hamlett and Haggins received life sentences as part of the state’s Habitual Felony Offender Act, first passed in 1977, which enhances criminal penalties for those with a prior criminal history. Courts have invoked that law less frequently since 2006, when new sentencing guidelines were adopted by the Alabama Legislature, but individuals may still receive long sentences for lower-level offenses if they have prior convictions.
Hamlett was charged and convicted of nonviolent, property offenses when he was 16 years old. Haggins had a series of convictions prior to getting sentenced in 1983: grand larceny in the same year and a second in 1978.
More than 300 people are serving life sentences for property crimes, while another 200 individuals were sentenced to life in prison for drug crimes, according to the report.
Having been sentenced to life in prison, both Hamlett and Haggins are but two of the almost 1,200 people with life sentences who must remain on parole for the rest of their lives. Almost 400 people remain on parole for more than 15 years while another 72 people are still on parole after 30 years, according to the report.
Alabama Appleseed has called for legislation allowing those sentenced to life because of HFOA to have their cases reviewed and potentially resentenced.
Alabama Appleseed proposes a series of reforms aimed at reducing the burden for those who spend years on parole.
The report urges the state to end the monthly $40 fee that people on parole must pay for their supervision. The organization also wants to expand opportunities for people on parole to be granted a pardon. The report calls for the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles to create a standardized process for communicating how people on parole may be granted a pardon that is mandatory and detailed.
Alabama Appleseed also wants to end the revocation of parole if people are arrested for a crime but not charged or convicted. It also wants to end automatic revocation for technical violations.
“We are not saying that every person with a life sentence should get out,” Crowder said. “This report just shows that over 7,000 people with life, life without parole, or virtual life, are too many people for our prisons to be well run.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-inmate-1024x647.jpg,,,2025-12-30 08:11:41.313611

At a Lansing news conference meant to push a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn marriage equality, a Michigan Republican instead found himself eclipsed. As Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) argued for banning same-sex marriage, Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield) — the state’s first openly gay senator — seized the moment, delivering a sharp, personal defense of LGBTQ+ families and the rights they’ve held for a decade. With GOP leaders distancing themselves from the proposal, Moss’s impromptu response stole the spotlight, turning an effort to roll back rights into a vivid reminder of how firmly marriage equality is now defended in Michigan.
 
 
Michigan State Police: Ted Nugent was armed during Capitol visit due to security breakdown

 
At a Michigan Capitol hearing where rockstar and conservative firebrand Ted Nugent was testifying against state conservation policies, a major security lapse stole headlines: Nugent walked into the building armed, despite a ban on open and concealed carry on Capitol grounds. Michigan State Police later confirmed that although the weapons detection system correctly flagged a possible weapon, the trooper at the checkpoint didn’t notice the alert until after Nugent had already entered and given his testimony — prompting an internal review of screening procedures. While officers later located Nugent and made sure he was no longer armed inside the Capitol, the incident raised fresh concerns about enforcement of safety policies in Michigan’s Capitol complex.
 
 
Michigan legislator says she underwent sterilization to avoid pregnancy during Trump presidency

 
Michigan state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) made national headlines when she revealed at a protest outside the State Capitol that she had voluntarily undergone sterilization — a deeply personal decision she said was driven by fear of losing access to contraception and reproductive health care under President Donald Trump’s administration. Speaking to hundreds gathered as part of a nationwide “50501 Movement,” Pohutsky said she chose the permanent procedure to avoid ever having to navigate a pregnancy in what she called “Donald Trump’s America,” arguing that her body should not be treated as “currency” by a government she believes threatens reproductive rights. Her candid disclosure sparked widespread discussion about reproductive freedom, political fear and the lengths some are taking to protect their autonomy.

University of Michigan Health ends gender-affirming care after DOJ subpoena

 
In a controversial decision that reverberated across the state, University of Michigan Health announced it would stop providing medically necessary gender-affirming care for minors after receiving a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a federal investigation into such treatments, a move that advocates say capitulates to political pressure and leaves transgender youth with fewer options for critical care. The hospital system — part of Michigan’s largest academic medical network — cited escalating legal risks in halting puberty blockers and hormone therapy for patients under 19, even as major medical organizations continue to recognize such care as evidence-based and lifesaving. Equality Michigan and others condemned the choice as harmful and chilling, while state leaders reiterated that gender-affirming care remains legal in Michigan and vowed to defend patients’ rights amid broader national scrutiny of transgender health services.
 
 
Whitmer signs Republican-led push for Michigan earmark reforms into law

 
In a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation following a bruising budget battle, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a pair of Republican‑led earmark reform bills into law, marking a significant shift in how Michigan handles legislatively directed spending. The new laws require state lawmakers to disclose earmarks publicly early in the budget process — including who sponsored them and why — instead of hiding them until the final budget vote, giving the public and press weeks to scrutinize these funding requests. Championed by House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and negotiated into the deal that ended a brief government shutdown, the reforms aim to inject transparency and accountability into Lansing’s budget process and curb “pork barrel” spending that critics contend too often occurs behind closed doors.
 
 
In Michigan, Vance makes a proposal to Whitmer: Sending National Guard troops to Detroit

 
During a visit to Howell in mid‑September, Vice President JD Vance made headlines by publicly offering to send National Guard troops into Detroit to help address crime — if Gov. Gretchen Whitmer simply asked for them, thrusting the controversial idea of federal military involvement in a major U.S. city back into the spotlight. Vance’s remarks — delivered at a rally originally focused on economic policy — underscored sharp political divisions over public safety, with Republicans framing the proposal as support for law‑and‑order and critics warning it could mean militarizing Detroit. While the Trump administration touted similar deployments elsewhere, local leaders and Whitmer herself have pushed back against the plan, arguing that existing partnerships and community‑based strategies are more effective than sending in troops.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1223-1-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-12-30 08:11:41.313611

(Photo by Dana DiFiliippo / New Jersey Monitor)The number of abortions in New Jersey has steadily climbed since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal right to abortion in 2022, a new report has found.
New Jersey’s abortion providers performed 4,920 abortions in June, up 21% from 4,060 in June 2022, when the nation’s top court overturned Roe v. Wade in a decision known as Dobbs, according to a Society of Family Planning report released earlier this month.
Clinicians in the Garden State provided 30,540 abortions during the first half of this year, and 57,510 abortions last year, up 8% from 53,290 in 2023, the report shows.
Since Dobbs, New Jersey lawmakers have codified abortion rights and enacted other protections for both patients and providers, including passing a shield law to prevent states that ban or restrict the procedure from holding out-of-state patients and their New Jersey-based providers criminally or civilly liable for abortions.
(Chart courtesy of Society of Family Planning)
New Jersey’s uptick in abortions has mirrored a trend in other states that have protected access to the procedure, as well as an overall national surge in abortions. There were 99,000 abortions on average per month across the country (totaling 591,770) for the first half of this year, compared to 80,000 a month in 2022, data shows.
Most abortions in New Jersey still take place in person, with about 12% provided through telehealth as of June.
That’s down from the national telehealth average of 27%, a figure inflated by states that ban abortion.  Where abortion is banned, almost all abortions were provided under shield laws via telehealth, researchers reported. Just 5% of abortions were provided via telehealth in spring 2022, data shows.
Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey, attributed the rising abortion numbers in New Jersey at least in part to out-of-state patients coming here. Planned Parenthood has 19 health centers in the Garden State.
“Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, abortion providers in New Jersey have stepped up to provide care to thousands of patients who are forced to leave their home states in search of abortion care,” Wojtowicz said. “These patients, coming from states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia, must travel hundreds of miles to access the care they need.”
Marie Tasy, who heads New Jersey Right to Life, had a different take. She said abortion is rising here because “the state keeps pouring hundreds of millions of taxpayer money into providers that perform abortions, while targeting pregnancy-resource centers that offer women real choices.”
A coalition of pregnancy centers has been fighting the state since Attorney General Matt Platkin issued a consumer alert in December 2022 claiming that some centers masquerade as abortion providers in an effort to discourage visitors from seeking abortion. The fight went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month.
The surge in abortions here “are a tragic reminder that our policies aren’t just wrong — they’re perverse. It’s a number to be mourned, not celebrated,” Tasy said.
“This administration and its party bosses have clearly failed women,” she added.

Dear Editor,
I believe Dan Jones’ Dec. 26 commentary regarding state employee remote work conflates physical presence with emotional presence. I strongly disagree with the idea that commitment to public service is rooted in shared place or shared fate. Equating remote work with diminished dedication is a false equivalence. Remote work has no bearing on whether someone is a committed public servant.
Service is an attitude, not a location. Anyone who has worked in a service profession understands this. Remote workers have had the privilege of working with people across the country and around the world in nonprofit settings, serving communities they would never meet and whose “shared fate” they did not personally inhabit. Their level of care and dedication was no less real or effective because of distance.

I worked for the state for a decade and left several years ago, well before the current union dispute, specifically because there was no permanent, standardized remote-work policy. During that time, I worked alongside many state employees who cared deeply about Vermonters and routinely went above and beyond in their work, including those who were remote most of the time.
I also worked with people who had spent much of their lives as state employees, lived in the communities they served and yet showed little awareness or concern for how their decisions affected people’s lives unless those people were personally known to them. Physical proximity did not translate into public-service ethic.
The suggestion that returning to the office is merely a matter of “discomfort” is dismissive and disrespectful. Yes, this is a work-life balance issue. Someone needing to work remotely in order to be present when their children get home from school is no different from someone leaving early or declining overtime because their child has a game that night. Both are choices that require coworkers to adjust. Neither reflects a lack of dedication to public service.
In my experience, forcing employees back into the office rarely produces the improvements promised. More often, productivity declines and turnover increases. When those outcomes occur, management tends to grow quiet rather than reflective.
Service is an attitude, not a desk. I would rather rely on a remote colleague who is genuinely invested in helping people than sit face-to-face with someone who performs concern as part of the job but never follows through. It is difficult to think outside the box when you do not recognize that you are in one — or where its boundaries lie.

Unemployment benefits for workers on strike. 
Those are just a few of the changes to state law taking effect in Washington on New Year’s Day. 
Some bills passed in 2025 became law earlier in the year, while others will take years to go into effect. The next legislative session, lasting 60 days, begins Jan. 12.
Here’s a look at some of the new laws on the books starting Thursday.
Unemployment for striking workers
One of the most contentious laws legislative Democrats pushed through this year gives workers on strike access to state unemployment benefits. 
After tense negotiations, lawmakers settled on giving striking workers up to six weeks of unemployment insurance, which is typically available for up to 26 weeks. The law also extends to employees forced off the job due to an employer-initiated lockout. 
Workers are eligible for unemployment insurance starting two to three weeks after the strike launches. If it doesn’t last that long, they won’t get benefits. And if the strike ends up being barred under state or federal law, they’ll have to repay them.
Business groups and Republicans worry the policy will incentivize strikes, leading to higher business costs.
The law is set to expire at the end of 2035. New York and New Jersey have similar statutes.
Each year, Washington’s Employment Security Department must file a report on the prevalence of these strikes and their effect on the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund, which is funded by a tax on employers. In a few years, the fund could drop below a threshold that triggers an additional tax on businesses to keep the account healthy, according to projections.
Big business surcharge
To fill an operating budget shortfall some estimated as high as $16 billion, lawmakers approved a slew of new taxes and fees, largely focused on businesses. 
One imposes an additional business and occupation tax on Washington companies with over $250 million in taxable income. The 0.5% tax is on income over that $250 million threshold. This surcharge is set to expire at the end of 2029.
Starting in fiscal year 2027, this is expected to raise $550 million per year for the state.
Legislators also made changes to the state’s tax on large technology companies. This “advanced computing surcharge” applies to businesses with worldwide gross revenue in excess of $25 billion. Until now, the tax those companies had to pay was limited to $9 million per year and the rate was 1.22%. 
This year, the state raised the rate to 7.5% and upped the cap to $75 million, starting Jan. 1. The proceeds go toward higher education programs. This is predicted to bring in $394 million next fiscal year.
Lawmakers considered uncapping the tax entirely, but that idea didn’t have legs this year.
Tax preferences
Another part of this year’s tax package was repealing a number of tax preferences. 
They include a tax exemption on precious metals. That will mean higher prices for coin and gold sales. Bipartisan bills have already sprung up before the 2026 legislative session begins, aiming to restore this tax break. 
Other repealed preferences include tax credits for home energy assistance and for businesses that hire employees who provide services to people outside the U.S., as well as a tax deduction for firms that provide testing for public safety employees.
In total, Senate Bill 5794 is expected to raise about $50 million for the current two-year state budget by getting rid of these tax breaks, though taxes on self-storage leasing and rentals that are part of the law won’t take effect until April. 
Transportation fees
The state’s transportation budget also faced a shortfall this year amid flagging gas tax revenue and skyrocketing construction costs. 
To fill it, lawmakers passed a revenue package — most notably a rare increase in the state’s gas tax, which rose 6 cents in July. Some other tax and fee hikes take effect Jan. 1. 
They include increasing truck and passenger vehicle weight fees, rental car taxes, vehicle sales tax, and applying a new luxury vehicle levy. 
The combined vehicle weight fee hikes are expected to bring in roughly $450 million over a half-dozen years.
The additional sales tax assessment on cars is going up from 0.3% to 0.5% to raise over $250 million over six years. The state is also imposing an 8% tax on the portion of a luxury vehicle’s sale price over $100,000. This doesn’t apply to commercial vehicles. It’s expected to bring over $200 million into state coffers over six years.

The state’s rental car tax is going up from 5.9% to 11.9% for one year, before dropping down to 9.9% in 2027. 
The tire replacement fee is increasing from $1 to $5, raising an estimated $117 million in six years. A fee on RV sales, meant to cover the cost of dealing with abandoned recreational vehicles, is also rising, from $6 to $8, a move expected to bring in $3 million. 
The $4.50 registration filing fee for vehicles is going up to $6 and the $5.50 title filing fee is rising to $6.50. Counties will retain most of the proceeds from this increase, but $5 million is set aside for statewide highway safety efforts. 
Other transportation fee hikes will go into effect later in 2026.
Nicotine tax
As part of the suite of tax hikes passed this year, the state is beginning to tax certain nicotine products, like Zyn pouches. 
Senate Bill 5814 extends Washington’s existing tax on the sale of miscellaneous tobacco products. Lawmakers said the goal was to capture emerging products that are exempt from excise taxes. 
This is expected to raise over $55 million in fiscal year 2027, rising to $67 million by fiscal year 2031.
Legislators pondered banning flavored tobacco products, like vapes, and increasing cigarette taxes to curb use, but the Legislature stubbed out that idea. The proposal would have also prohibited the sale of nicotine pouches, like Zyn, to people under age 21.
Plastic bags
For years, the state has worked to reduce waste from single-use plastics. A 2020 law sets out to make plastic shopping bags thicker so they are more reusable. It also raised the price for these bags.
The price has been 8 cents. But starting Jan. 1, it will increase to 12 cents per bag. The fee for paper bags will remain 8 cents.
About 80,000 businesses are estimated to be affected by the policy.
The change comes as a study out of Washington State University raises questions about the efficacy of the state’s approach. It says that while plastic bag use has dropped, the thickness of the bags has meant more overall plastic waste, though state officials note the data backing the report is incomplete.
The state was also set to increase the required thickness of plastic bags from 2.25 mils to 4 mils on Jan. 1, but a bill passed this year punts that shift to 2028. 
Right to repair
Washington is joining a growing list of states trying to tear down barriers for consumers who want to repair their electronics rather than buy new ones.
It took years to get “right to repair” legislation like House Bill 1483 across the finish line in the Legislature. The law requires manufacturers to make tools, parts and documentation needed for diagnostics and maintenance available to independent repair businesses. The requirement applies to digital electronics, like computers, cellphones and appliances, that were first sold in Washington after July 1, 2021. 
The state attorney general’s office can enforce violations of the new law under the Consumer Protection Act. 
Though it had strong bipartisan support, opponents argued the law could harm businesses’ reputations if repairs aren’t completed correctly, and potentially leave users’ personal information unsecured. But some tech giants, including Google and Microsoft, backed the legislation. 
Blood type
Starting Jan. 1, Washingtonians can choose to include their blood type on their driver’s license or identification card. They’ll have to provide documentation verifying their blood type. 
The state Department of Licensing can charge a $2 administrative fee to include this on an applicant’s ID. 
The hope is this will allow first responders to quickly identify what type of blood the person needs in an emergency. 
Movie captions
Washington movie theaters will be required to provide closed captioning technology. And those with more than five theaters in the state have to run a certain number of screenings with open captioning on the screen, if available. 
Smaller theater chains have to host an open-caption screening if requested.

They’re partners in Olive and Honey, the name they chose when they bought a florist shop and the building that houses it in 2022. They renovated the 130-year-old brick building to boost sales from local customers and attract tourist traffic drawn by nearby Missouri Star Quilt Co.
“We took down a wall, and we doubled the square footage of our home decor and gift area,” Bodehamer said.
They expected the improvements would add to the building’s taxable value. What they didn’t anticipate was that the Caldwell County Assessor’s office would double or triple the assessments on almost every commercial building in Hamilton.
Sisters Mati Waltemeyer, left, and McCall Bodehamer outside Olive and Honey, the florist and gift shop they opened in December 2022 in Hamilton. Their 2025 property tax bill is five times larger than it was in 2024 after the building’s assessment increased 319% (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
When the tax bill came at the start of November, it showed Waltemeyer and Bodehamer owed $2,783, up from $564 in 2024.
The new values weren’t based on a whim of the county assessor. The county signed agreements with the Missouri State Tax Commission to boost both commercial and residential appraisals after studies showed values were below market rates.
“We did not pick on Hamilton,” Assessor Tracy Bowen said in an interview with The Independent.
The sisters’ shock at a 393% increase in their tax bill is an extreme example of something that can happen to property owners anywhere in the state. If the value of an individual property increases faster than properties generally during biennial reassessments, the result can be a dramatically higher tax bill.
Taxpayers are supposed to be protected by the Hancock Amendment of the state constitution, which requires tax rates to be lowered when property values rise faster than inflation.
The problem is, that cap is on total revenue from property taxes, and most taxing districts charge a single rate for all types of property — residential, commercial, agricultural, personal and “centrally assessed” railroad and utility. So when values in one subclass rise faster than the average increase, the tax burden shifts. 
One solution — to require separate tax rates for each property subclass — is gaining momentum as the 2026 legislative session approaches. It will be the centerpiece of recommendations from a Missouri House committee that spent the summer studying property taxes, said the chairman, state Rep. Tim Taylor, a Bunceton Republican.
“Without question, you’re going to see that kind of leading the charge,” Taylor said. “I really, truly believe, as do others, that that will eliminate many of the ills that people have suffered.”
 Shifting burdens 

Of the five types of property values that make up the total assessment for the state’s nearly 3,000 individual taxing districts, the values for only two, residential and commercial, are based on what the county assessor estimates is  what the property would sell for if it changed hands. 
For the other three — personal property like cars, farmland, and railroad and utility property — values are set on a statewide basis. Assessors use national trade-in values for vehicles. The State Tax Commission sets values for farmland and determines the market value for railroad and utility property.
Outside of St. Louis County, all types of property in a taxing district are in one metaphorical bucket for taxation. The constitutional cap on revenue allows the bucket to grow as prices rise generally.
A rollback reducing tax rates takes place when reassessment causes revenue to exceed the cap. Any rollback applies to all property, so properties that go up more than average pay more and those that do not pay less.
A report from a Missouri Association of Counties Property Tax Task Force says the current system is “diluting the rollback effect.”
“How is this happening if Hancock is working correctly?” asked Steve Hobbs, executive director of the association, before answering his own question: “It’s not.”
New York Life representative Mike Brown outside his office in Hamilton. His 2025 property tax bill is three times larger than it was in 2024 after the building’s assessment increased 175% (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Mike Brown, a New York Life representative in Hamilton organizing efforts to mitigate some of the commercial assessment increase, said he understands the need to align taxable values with market values.
But a more measured approach, he said, would have been easier to accept.
The assessment on Brown’s office building increased 175%, from $23,000 to $63,375. His taxes rose from $570 to $1,850. Setting aside a new levy to pay city bonds for street improvements, the bill is 171% higher than in 2024.
Brown admits the value set by the assessor is probably correct, but a more gradual increase would make more sense. 
“They are changing these assessments all in one tax year instead of 10%, 15% per year over the last 10 years or so,” Brown said.
 Shifting ratios

Statewide, about 55% of all taxable property is residential, according to tables published in the State Tax Commission’s 2024 annual report. Commercial and personal property each account for about 20% of the total. The smallest portion is farmland, less than 1.5% of all assessments, and what is left is the state-assessed utility and railroad properties.
Over 10 years, the ratio of property types to the whole hasn’t changed dramatically — about 2.5 percentage points have moved among the subclasses — but owners of the subclasses growing fastest are feeling the shift in their bank accounts.
Tables published in the State Tax Commission’s 2014 report show a total state assessment of $97 billion. The 2024 tables put that figure at $152 billion, an increase of 56%.
Residential values are driving the increase, up 63%. Farmland values increased the least, only 15%.
In Caldwell County, one of the factors pushing taxes to commercial building owners is a far different mix of property than the state as a whole. Residential property is only about one-third of the total, while two large pipelines make the state-assessed portion almost as large.
Reassessment this year, for the first time, pushed the total value of commercial property in the county above the value given to farmland. Since 2015, Caldwell County’s total assessed value has increased 52%, led by a 77.8% increase in commercial property values.
In that same period, the assessed value of farmland has gone up only 20%. 
This year, the assessed value of commercial property throughout Caldwell County increased 14.5%, farmland went up 2% and the value of centrally-assessed property declined.
Hamilton cut the tax rate for city services by 9% to comply with the Hancock Amendment. The city understands the distress reassessment created for business owners, City Administrator Lauren Dannar said.
“We’ve tried to do everything we can to assist in this,” Dannar said.
Gary Romine, chairman of the State Tax Commission, testifies to a Missouri House committee July 16 with commission member Debbi McGinnis (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Static amounts set by the tax commission for the productive value of farmland, unchanged since 2015, contribute to the shift in the mix of property values. The values now are below the amounts used in the 1980s, even as market prices for farmland have soared 40% since 2018. 
The centrally assessed railroad, pipeline and utility values set by the commission have also lagged behind the general increase, going up only 43% over the past 10 years.
The diminishing share for farmland and state-assessed properties was a regular complaint during hearings, said state Rep. Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, the ranking Democrat on the House committee studying property taxes. 
“One common theme we see, she said, “is that the state tax commission has really put pressure on our local assessors to assess fairly, but they are not doing it themselves, and they are doing it on properties that impact almost every one of our communities.” 
The lobbying power of agriculture and utility interests, Hobbs said, contributes to the imbalance. 
Residential assessments have been climbing because of changes to the housing market after COVID, Hobbs said, and have outpaced the other property classes. That pushes taxes onto homeowners, who are paying more while some property owners have seen tax cuts of up to 40%, he said.
“The very bedrock of property tax is that it should be fair, equitable and affordable for all,” Hobbs said. “The system is not broken, but it needs to have modern solutions.”
Homeowners in some neighborhoods of south St. Louis received tax bills that doubled or tripled after this year’s reassessment. The values rose faster than the general increase because demand for homes caused a rapid increase in value or the homes had been undervalued for years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
State Rep. Tim Taylor of Bunceton, chairman of the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform, listens during testimony at a September public hearing (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Separating classes for individual tax rates would mean each is in its own, smaller bucket. Lumping everything together, Taylor said, is what shifts the burden.
“If the assessed value goes up, but it’s not enough to overflow, then nothing changes,” he said.
While the state tax commission doesn’t establish local market values for residential and commercial properties, it does monitor how those properties are valued. When appraisals fall below a target of 90% to 110% of local market values, the commission can ask assessors to increase them.
The commission can withhold funds appropriated to support assessment inspections and other work if the local values aren’t updated.
Prior to the most recent reassessment cycle, 76 counties were asked to sign a memorandum of understanding with the commission that they would increase residential assessments, and 64 did so.
Ten counties were asked to sign a memorandum covering commercial real estate and nine signed. Caldwell County along with five others signed both. That is why in June, Brown and other property owners in Caldwell County received notice of the assessment increases. 
Residential properties were valued at about 80% of the market and would go up modestly, the notice read. Commercial appraisals, however, were much further off. Assessments on some of those properties, then-Assessor Beverly Alden wrote, would increase by 200% or more.
 Multiple rate effect

Every county in the state has the option of forgoing the single rate for all property in favor of rates by subclass.
In St. Louis County, where it is already used, tax rates fall when assessment increases within a subclass rise faster than inflation, but only for property owners within that subclass. St. Louis County adopted the system of separate rates in 2003 and, as a result, residential properties generally pay the lowest rates, followed by commercial property owners.
Among the 159 taxing entities in St Louis County, 71% cut the tax rate ceilings for residential property and 63% cut the ceilings for commercial property following reassessment in 2023.
Only six taxing districts reduced rates on personal property like automobiles.
Statewide after the 2023 reassessment cycle, 23% of tax rate ceilings were reduced in counties that use a single rate. Tax rates increased for 15% of levies, mainly because of local elections approving new taxes.
And the gap between the lowest and highest rates within each district in St. Louis County grows with every reassessment cycle. 
After the 2023 reassessment, a report from the State Auditor’s office shows, tax rates on residential and business properties in some St. Louis County districts were 30% or more below the rate for personal property like automobiles.
The gaps are largest in school tax rates, the biggest piece of almost every property tax bill. The lowest rate allowed for school purposes is $2.75 per $100 of assessed value, while most other tax rates are below $1 per $100.
The St. Louis County school district with the largest difference between the lowest and highest tax rates in 2023 was Bayless in the southern part of the county. Residential property owners paid $3.083 per $100 assessed value, while personal property taxes were set at $5.3231 per $100. 
That $2.24 per $100 gap is almost 26% greater than the largest difference in 2019.
In two of St. Louis County’s 21 school districts, homeowners pay only the minimum school tax rate while other property owners pay more.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, right, speaks during the Oct. 20 meeting of the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform. while the chairman, state Rep. Tim Taylor of Bunceton, far left, looks on (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
A multi-rate system is attractive, Steinhoff said.
“What relief it provides is when one class has a significant change in its value, its assessment, it’s providing relief within that class that is not spread out,” she said.
But if counties turn to a multi-rate system, it means locking each property class into its current share of the total tax, she said. With farms, utilities and railroad property lagging the general increase over many years, lawmakers must consider what is fair to all taxpayers, she said.
“One of the things that we have to be really cautious about is, are we going to continue to just base (tax rates) on one moment in time, and maybe not question whether the balance was right in that one moment in time,” Steinhoff said.
The tax commission hasn’t taken an official position on implementing a multi-rate system, general counsel Greg Allsberry said in an email to The Independent.
“However, the commission believes that separating subclasses for the purposes of determining rates could strengthen the effectiveness of the state’s Hancock Amendment,” Allsberry said.
The committee is recommending other changes, ranging from expanding the three-member tax commission, limits on its power to force large increases in assessments and lowering the target for how close to actual market prices a county must be, Taylor said.
“There is no one cure all,” he said, “but you’re going to find that there’s a dozen things that are noticeable, and a dozen fixes that can all work together to make this better.”
Improved outreach to taxpayers would help people understand what a new assessment means, how to appeal if they disagree and what other options they have if their tax bills spike, Steinhoff said.
“A lot of that just needs to be cleaned up,” she said. “It’s almost like the customer service end of things we have really dropped the ball on.”
 Too late

There is only one stop sign and no traffic lights on Davis Street in Hamilton. 
Visitors can admire the recently installed statue of Caldwell County native James Cash Penney, the founder of the JCPenney department store chain, or shop at more than half-dozen stores operated by Missouri Star Quilt Co.
The hot place in town for entertainment is Jiggs and Gigs, about a half mile west of the stop sign. Denise Anderson and Ellen Williamson renovated a vacant former feed store, installed a kitchen and built a stage.

They have 20 employees and a big tax bill to pay. The improvements and reassessment boosted the taxable value by more than 500% and their tax bill went up by a similar amount.
Anderson and Williamson have the right to appeal the assessment. But at this point in the process, they will have to pay their tax bill in full but under protest, identifying the portion of the assessment they are appealing.

In June, my husband and I welcomed our first son, Robin, and the three months I spent off of work caring for him gave me a new appreciation for paid family leave — something virtually all workers will be entitled to in Minnesota on Jan. 1.
Starting him at child care has also given me a new appreciation of Minnesota’s high child care costs — among the highest in the nation!
When I wasn’t changing diapers or googling “how to get spit up out of couch cushion,” I wrote some stories for the Reformer. Here are a few of my favorites.
Weed charges
My most popular story this year with readers was about a surprising trend hiding in plain sight: people getting charged with having marijuana in their cars.
Most Minnesotans probably assume, like I did, that weed is legal now and that is that — so long as you’re an adult and don’t have more on you than the very generous state maximum.
But then a public defender told me about a client who was charged with having improperly packaged cannabis in the car. What?
Cannabis must be sealed in its original packaging from the dispensary in a car, or else stowed in the trunk — an important fact not mentioned in the state’s lengthy adult-use cannabis law or “need to know” webpage.
I was curious how often cops were citing people for this, so I put in public information requests to the Minnesota Judicial Branch and found the answer is … quite a lot.
Prosecutors have brought more than 3,500 charges against people for having improperly packaged cannabis in their cars. I also found apparent racial and geographic disparities. Edina, it turns out, is a powerhouse for cannabis container charges.
Criminal defense attorneys I spoke with said their clients were uniformly surprised to learn they must keep their stuff in the trunk unless it’s sealed in its original packaging. While prosecutors and police told me there’s an obvious public safety rationale for keeping intoxicating substances out of the reach of drivers, defense attorneys worry the law is perpetuating the War on Drugs approach to cannabis, which legalization was supposed to undo.
Wage theft

Wage theft continued to be a key focus of mine.
I covered the first felony conviction of wage theft since the state Legislature passed a law in 2019 to treat wage theft like all other forms of theft. Painting contractor Frederick Newell was sentenced to three years probation for stealing more than $37,000 in wages from five workers at an affordable housing development in Minneapolis. Since I was the only reporter to show up to his trial, the Reformer was the only outlet to have a photo of him.
As I’ve reported for the past several years, charges are rare for wage theft despite it likely being one of the most common forms of theft. Cases notably picked up in 2025 as part of focused efforts by the Attorney General’s Office and the county attorneys in Hennepin and Ramsey counties.
Attorney General Keith Ellison filed felony wage theft charges against the owner of a sprawling central Minnesota dairy operation, Keith Schaefer. Ellison had previously filed a civil suit against the dairy owner, alleging the company stole at least $3 million in wages from hundreds of mostly undocumented immigrants, settling the case for just $250,000.
Ramsey County Attorney John Choi charged the owner of a roofing company for stealing an estimated $118,000 in wages from seven workers, and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty charged Bishop Harding Smith, the head of a violence intervention nonprofit, with shorting workers $150,000.
SEIU Local 26 sounded the alarm that contractors for Ramsey and Hennepin counties shorted workers hundreds of thousands of dollars. I reported earlier this month that Hennepin County investigated the claims and found itself partly responsible for scores of security officers being underpaid more than $335,000. I’ll be following what happens with the contracted janitorial services in Ramsey County next year.
These are large sums that workers should have received so they could pay their bills, put gas in their cars and buy Christmas presents for their children.
Instead, they incurred overdraft fees or late penalties, borrowed from family and went without.
Ken Martin’s ascent

I reported out a colorful profile of longtime Democratic-Farmer-Labor Chair Ken Martin as he ascended to the national stage to chair the Democratic National Committee.
I knew I had to begin the piece with Martin rolling up in the DFL van to the scene of a car accident involving two elected Democrats, where an empty alcohol container was found. The DFL van became a minor meme among Minnesota Republicans, which spoke to Martin’s reputation with both his supporters and his haters as an adroit political operative.
There were other illustrative details about Martin such as his wrangling with leftist factions of the party, at one point telling an anonymous Twitter account with a profile picture of Hello Kitty holding an AK-47, “You’re a grown man FFS, start acting like one.”
The defining characteristic of Martin is his focus on winning, whether it requires bringing people together or stomping out dissent. The title of my piece was “Ken Martin just wants to win” and during his 15 years atop the DFL, the party won every statewide race.
It’s still unclear whether he can scale his strategy. He’s had a bumpy start to his tenure, including a very public spat with former DNC vice chair David Hogg. Recently, Martin decided to shelve an autopsy of Democrats’ disastrous 2024 performance.
“Here’s our North Star: Does this help us win?” Martin said in a statement to the New York Times. “If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”
A break for the Break Room
For nearly two years, I wrote a weekly Friday column called the Break Room, rounding up labor news in Minnesota and beyond. Each week I reported out a lead story — aiming to give readers something they weren’t getting anywhere else — while running down the other top four or five stories of the week.
I covered big stories that received national readership, such as how Trump’s early orders affected workers, and important but undercovered local stories, like the division between trade unions and public sector unions over data centers.
Writing Break Room during labor’s resurgence in recent years has been rewarding and challenging.
I took a break from Break Room when I went on parental leave, which offered a chance to reassess both the column and my coverage going forward. Patrick and I have decided to sunset Break Room so I can spend more time on politics and investigations in 2026. Labor will still be a focus for me.

On that same day, Mississippi Today Ideas’ inaugural guest essay, written by Civil Rights icon Myrlie Evers, was published.
The calendar is close enough to the anniversary of the announcement and Evers’ inaugural essay to proclaim that Mississippi Today Ideas has been in existence for a year.
And while in many ways we are just getting started, what a first year it has been for MT Ideas. We have heard from famous Mississippians, such as former governors, Mississippi-born music legend Marty Stuart and from everyday Mississippians who we believed had important information to share.
Just in the month of December as Mississippi Today Ideas closed out its first year in existence, we published essays from acclaimed Mississippi-born movie director Tate Taylor about the rededication of a historically significant church in southwest Mississippi and from central Mississippi middle school teacher Brandy Richardson who is toiling to improve the educational outcome of her students.
The Ideas section publishes opinion pieces from both Mississippi Today staff and from guest writers. We look for essays that inform the readers about our state and about the communities where we live and hopefully the writers on occasion suggest solutions to the issues facing our state and communities.
“Mississippi Today Ideas will serve as a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future,” Ganucheau wrote in announcing the inception of Mississippi Today Ideas on Jan. 15. “Rather than following a traditional newspaper opinion section format, the section will strive to focus on creative, constructive solutions that address Mississippi’s unique challenges and inspire progress.”
We also strive to publish quality writing. People who read the MT Ideas section will be impressed with the quality of many of the essays.
In a very real sense, Myrlie Evers had to write the first essay for Mississippi Today Ideas. She, better than any person, bridges the state’s bad and good. No one has more reason to despise her native state than her, who lost her husband, Civil Rights leader Medgar Evers, to a racist assassin who for decades Mississippians refused to punish despite overwhelming evidence. The assassin was finally convicted in 1994. Myrlie Evers wrote about her native state and proclaimed in the essay in 2025, “I still believe in Mississippi.”
How powerful.
Mississippi Today has published 94 guest essays – an average of nearly two per week. We also have published 70 staff written pieces for MT Ideas.
The most read Mississippi Today Ideas offering for the past year was an essay by Ole Miss quarterback legend Archie Manning.
Manning, who has spent his adult life living in nearby New Orleans where for most of his professional football career played for the Saints, wrote about how he has throughout his life maintained his love for Mississippi and remains involved in various entrepreneurial endeavors in his native state.
The realization that Manning’s guest essay was the most read Mississippi Today Ideas’ submission resuscitated a memory of watching a first college football game, the nationally televised Ole Miss-Alabama game in 1969. Manning set multiple Southeastern Conference records in that epic contest, producing legions of long-time Manning fans.
Manning in many ways bridges the state’s past and present.

Half the financial relief requests since 2020 were staffing related. Vermont has used contract staffing at the highest rate in the nation in recent years. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  More bailouts for nursing homes? Why Vermont has given millions to keep care centers afloat..","With the second oldest population in the country, Vermont needs its nursing homes. Yet, while Vermonters rapidly age, the state’s long-term care capacity has dwindled, losing 900 beds in the last two decades. 
To keep the struggling system afloat, the state has bailed out nursing homes with around $38 million in state and federal Medicaid dollars for so-called extraordinary financial relief over the past five years, according to records obtained by VTDigger. 
The practice, which has not previously received media attention, has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers, who this year asked for comprehensive reports and payment records from state leaders regarding the bailout program.

For their part, state health officials say Vermont’s nursing homes are a vital piece of the eldercare landscape. Without extraordinary financial relief, they say, the state would have lost even more critical bedspace. 
Efforts to address the upstream causes of the nursing homes’ financial crises, like the state’s reliance on traveling nurses, have received far less financial support.
Around half of the extraordinary financial requests from 2020 onward mention concerns with increased costs of staffing, particularly contract staffing. Staff and contract staff make up about 50% of total costs in nursing homes’ budgets, according to the state. 
Vermont’s nursing homes depend on traveling staff more than those in any other state, according to federal data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
There are many reasons extraordinary financial relief is not a sustainable means to “plug the gap” for nursing homes, “but we needed something,” said Helen Labun, the Vermont Health Care Association’s executive director. 
“We don’t want EFR to be a standard option,” Labun said. “It really is meant to be an extraordinary measure.” 
An old program meets an urgent need 
Despite existing for more than 20 years, Vermont’s extraordinary financial relief program started playing a recurring and sustaining role for the state’s nursing homes only since the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The bureaucratic program routes through multiple departments nested within Vermont’s Agency of Human Services. 
The Department of Vermont Health Access’s rate-setting division, which sets Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes, reviews requests submitted by facilities. But the funds for extraordinary financial relief come from Medicaid dollars allocated through the Vermont Department of Disability, Aging, and Independent Living, according to the department’s commissioner, Jill Bowen.
Nursing homes, which receive extraordinary financial relief, provide the most intense level of care, serving people who wouldn’t have their needs met in an assisted living or residential care home, according to Labun. These facilities must serve patients on Medicaid to qualify for financial relief, she said.
There are 33 nursing homes in the state, with a total of about 2,847 beds as of July, a decline of nearly 900 beds in the last 20 years, according to the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Bowen said the loss of beds in long-term care facilities in the state is worrying given Vermont’s aging demographic, though she said the trend may partially stem from people seeking at-home care instead.

Angela Smith-Dieng, director of DAIL’s Adult Services Division, said the state does not want to lose options for its large elderly population, so extraordinary financial relief is “incredibly important as a tool to prevent nursing home closures.”
One factor leading to increased emergency funding requests, according to state leaders, is the “rebasing” of Medicaid reimbursements. Rebasing, which most recently has occurred in 2025 and 2023, according to state leaders, changes Medicaid reimbursement rates based on cost data from earlier years. In 2023, the state altered reimbursement rates based on 2020 costs, which didn’t yet capture the new financial pressures brought on by the pandemic. 
In July, the state again balanced reimbursement rates, this time using 2023 costs, which Bowen hopes will limit the need for extraordinary financial relief.
Working with the Legislature, the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living advocated for changing how much facilities are paid based on their occupancy, reducing penalties for not meeting high thresholds, according to Bowen.

In some instances, the state has advanced nursing facilities money through the bailout process or provided more money than a facility requested. The state may advance facilities funds if they will not be able to meet payroll for staff, Bowen said, but she added that the state was more likely to provide less — not more — than a company wanted. 
The state has recouped every advance back or was in the process of recouping them, according to the department’s rate setting division.  
As part of an extraordinary funding review, Jaime Mooney, the director of the rate setting division, said the state examines a company’s finances and whether facilities are in compliance with state and federal requirements.
After the rate setting division reviews the request, combing through the provided financial information like past-due invoices and the amount of cash on hand, the division makes a recommendation to the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living. 
The rate setting division also consults with DAIL regarding possible issues with the care provided by the requesting facility. But Mooney said she couldn’t recall ever denying a facility’s request due to the quality of care. 
If a request is granted, the state restricts the grant’s use, and facilities cannot pay penalties or exorbitant owner-administrator fees using the financial relief funds, according to Mooney. 
Once granted, the facility must meet reporting requirements, including providing updated financial information, she said. 
According to Labun, nursing home owners need to demonstrate they don’t have money from other sources. That prevents companies that own many facilities from shifting their investments to out-of-state homes and then requesting bailouts from Vermont. 
In the past, nursing homes had savings they could rely on when reimbursement rates weren’t covering expenses, Labun said. But, during the Covid-19 pandemic, nursing homes’ coffers ran dry, and extraordinary financial relief was retrofitted to respond to the emergency at nursing homes, Labun said. 
‘Outlier state’
Nursing homes typically used extraordinary financial relief in one-off cash flow emergencies to “fight financial storms that they might not otherwise have been able to weather,” according to Labun. 
That’s now changed, and the cost of nursing is driving the crunch.
Contract staff tend to cost facilities at least twice as much as permanent staff, contributing to nursing homes’ financial distress, Labun said. The use of contract staff in Vermont has fallen slightly, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. But the state’s rate is still exceedingly high compared with the national average, and it has yet to be seen whether this downward trend continues, Labun said. 
“Vermont’s an outlier state in terms of our use of travelers as part of a normal part of the workforce,” Labun said.

While the nation saw heightened rates of contract staff at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the rates have generally returned to the pre-pandemic norm, said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a national nonprofit organization. That’s not the case in Vermont.
Vermont nursing homes had the highest rate of contract staff employment compared to those in other states in 2024, peaking at 31% in the first quarter of 2024, according to analysis of Medicaid data by the Long Term Care Community Coalition. The national average in the same period was 8%.
Mollot, an advocate for nursing home residents, said nursing homes often use a larger number of contract staff when there is high attrition among permanent staff, which is often a result of poor working conditions such as workplace hazards or low pay.
Staffing tends to be the highest expenditure for nursing homes, and oftentimes nursing homes that work with temporary staffing agencies are contractually obligated to pay contract staff more than permanent staff, said Kaili Kuiper, Vermont Legal Aid’s long-term care ombudsman. That means nursing homes spend much of their budget on filling the staffing gap with temporary staff, and do not have the funds to invest in recruiting long-term staff. 
This is a “difficult cycle to break, because there’s only so much money to go around,” Kuiper said. The cycle can also cause poor care, and Kuiper said her office has seen “a lot of issues that are related to there not being enough staffing to provide the care that’s needed,” including problems with response times and hygiene. 
Not a sustainable means to ‘plug the gap’
Vermont’s demographic challenges are driving the underlying problem of nursing homes’ high use of contract staff, Labun said. 
So, in recent years, the Legislature has allocated some funds to rebuild the nursing workforce.  
The state put half a million dollars toward attracting and keeping licensed nursing assistants in the current fiscal year budget. That investment was an attempt at addressing the upstream causes of nursing homes’ financial woes, according to Sen. Richard Westman, R-Lamoille, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and serves on the board of a rural hospital. 
The state plans to draw down federal funds for workforce development from the Civil Monetary Penalty Reinvestment Program that had previously been held up in between the President Joe Biden’s and President Donald Trump’s administrations and during the federal shutdown, Labun said.

The legislative investment was far less than the money spent on extraordinary relief, but Westman argued that prioritization makes sense, given the financial weakness of some facilities. In the last two years, about two-thirds of nursing homes have requested extraordinary relief, he said in a May interview. 
“I think one could make an argument that without that help, they probably would have gone out of business,” Westman said. 
Staffing underlies the financial challenges, Westman said, echoing others. Investing in nurse recruitment and retention, as well as increasing reimbursement rates nursing homes receive, could prevent the facilities’ reliance on bail out money, he suggested. 
Kuiper said that using temporary emergency staff is an important tool. As the state’s advocate for nursing home residents, Kuiper said employing contract staff is a better alternative than allowing a facility to be understaffed. 
But in the long run, Kuiper said she would like to see “a stronger movement away from temporary staff,” and for the care community to prioritize strategies to curb the high use of contract staff as the “status quo.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)George Escobar doesn’t like to use the phrase “told you so,” but after seeing a surge in immigration arrests that advocates had warned about when lawmakers failed to pass limits on local immigration enforcement, it’s hard to avoid.
Escobar, the incoming executive director of the immigrant advocacy group CASA, was referring to last-minute action in the Maryland Senate during the 2025 General Assembly that stripped out a proposal to ban “287(g)” agreements, which allow local police agencies to work with federal immigration officials. Eight counties in Maryland have signed such agreements, five of them just this year.
Passing that bill is “our No. 1 priority for the legislative session,” said Escobar, who takes over at CASA on Jan. 1. Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), the lead sponsor on last session’s bill, has vowed to bring it back in the 2026 General Assembly, and the proposal has gained a powerful new supporter since last spring in Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), who said he supports the bill.
“It is frustrating thinking about the obstacles that we faced and the evidence that we shared,” Escobar earlier said this month. “We have seen changes even in our legislators like our Senate president. We always welcome a change of heart, and that support will mean the difference between life and death.”

To Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, a longtime defender of 287(g) agreements, that sort of talk is just political hype from opponents of a program he said has worked well since his county joined in 2008.
“I will argue any day of the week, with anybody that the fact we have removed 1,877 criminals out of this county, not to reoffend, not to commit more crimes, we are a safe county because of it,” Jenkins said.
The debate comes as immigration detentions in Maryland, as in the rest of the country, have surged in the past year under President Donald Trump. Data from the Prison Policy Initiative showed the more than 3,000 people in Maryland were arrested this year by Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 1,193 from Jan. 20, when Trump was inaugurated, through May 20, and another 1,940 from May 21 to Oct. 15.
The 287(g) program was first established in 1996, but it has gained more attention, and more scrutiny, since Trump returned to office. Versions of the program include allowing local officials to execute administrative immigration warrants in their jails, identifying and beginning removal proceedings against individuals arrested by local law enforcement, and serving on task forces that officers “enforce limited immigration authority.”
Five sheriff’s departments in Maryland – Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington counties – signed 287(g) this year. Frederick, Cecil and Harford counties already had agreements in place. All the Maryland agreements are limited to the counties’ jails: If a local department determines that someone they arrested is undocumented, it will hold that inmate for an additional 48 hours for ICE to come get them
Still, advocates said the program incentives racial profiling, especially of Latinos.
Williams said she sponsored the Maryland Values Act — and plans to do so again next year — because it’s just the right thing to do. If Maryland banned 287(g) agreements it would be following the lead of several other states, she said. Those states include Illinois, California and New Jersey.
“Contrary to what some may say, I think it [287(g) program] does more harm from a public safety standpoint than a benefit,” Williams said. “It has a very chilling effect on individuals within our communities all across the state from wanting to engage and participate with law enforcement
“This is about ensuring all of our communities, regardless of where you live in the state … that they know that law enforcement is there for everyone and not just certain individuals within our state,” she said.
As immigration arrests surge, so does number of Maryland sheriffs agreeing to work with ICE

But Jenkins said he does not think a ban would be constitutional, and that it would be certain to draw a legal challenge.
“I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t believe they have the authority as a legislature to take away my authority to make a decision to enter into an agreement to keep my county safe. I think there’s a [legal] challenge there,” he said.
He disagrees with those who say the agreement encourages racial profiling. While the agreement allows the sheriff’s department to ask a person’s citizenship or immigration status, that is only after they have been arrested on another charge, he said.
“It has nothing to do with race or ethnicity. It has nothing to do with going after people,” Jenkins said. “Everything we do in this program is after the physical arrest. I have to put you in handcuffs and take you to jail.
“All this fear is political hype,” he said. “I think it’s largely political rhetoric by the people who don’t want any enforcement whatsoever.”
But Escobar pointed to a 2008 case in Frederick County, when a woman successfully sued the county after sheriff’s deputies arrested her on a civil immigration warrant while she was eating her lunch on a park bench before work. According to a summary of the case, Roxana Orellana Santos was held in the county jail before being turned over to ICE, where she was held for 46 days, away from her then 1-year-old U.S. child,
“You fast-forward to today and the same thing is happening,” Escobar said.
‘Eliminate 287(g)’
Critics of the program invoke the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant who was stopped by federal agents, detained and almost immediately deported. His case has become a high-profile example of Trump administration deportation policies.
Strictly, Abrego Garcia’s case has nothing to do with 287(g), since it was carried out by federal authorities. But critics of the program say it opens the door to the types of stops and detention that ensnared Abrego Garcia.

“It’s time for the Maryland General Assembly to step it up and eliminate 287(g) because we want to be a state that is based on community trust and eliminating 287(g) is part of that goal,” said Montgomery County Council president Natali Fani-González, who has participated in rallies in support of Abrego Garcia.
Darren Popkin, executive director of the Maryland Sheriffs’ Association, said his organization will not take a position on Williams’ bill until seeing a draft of the legislation.
But at a hearing earlier this year on House Bill 1222, Popkin wrote in a March 27 letter with the Maryland Chiefs of Police Association htat they opposed the measure.
“HB 1222 … imposes a one-size-fits-all mandate that strips local jurisdictions of their ability to make determinations that best serve the safety and well-being of their communities,” the letter said.
Popkin reiterated that point in an interview this month.
“The sheriffs and the public in those jurisdictions have made policy decisions that they believe keep their communities safer to have these programs within their detention centers, which limits the immigration activities outside of the detention centers,” he said, adding that it “is not accurate” to suggest that local sheriffs are performing immigration enforcement in their communities under the agreements.
Still, Escobar said local governments should not work with “paramilitary forces” like ICE.
“We’re talking about voluntary agreements that these sheriffs are engaging in [with] the federal government to help them do their job,” he said. “It is fundamentally damaging local law enforcement’s relationship with the community.”

House Bill 1792, dubbed the Sentencing Modernization Act of 2024, creates a uniform classification system for all felony offenses and maximum fines.
“It is a big deal,” said Sen. Dave Rader, R-Tulsa, who carried the measure in the Senate.
It organizes more than 2,000 felonies into 14 classes based on severity. It sets standard sentencing ranges for certain felonies. Repeat offenders face harsher penalties under the measure.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

Supporters of the measure said it creates more clarity and consistency in sentencing.
Rader said the measure will make sure all Oklahoma counties are following similar sentencing ranges.
Prior to the measure, two individuals living in different parts of the state and convicted for the same crime could receive substantially different sentences, Rader said.
The provisions in the bill came from the Oklahoma Criminal Justice Reclassification Council, created by the legislature in 2018.
Adoption tax credit
House Bill 2610 increases the allowable tax credit for nonrecurring adoption expenses, such as attorney fees and court costs.
The credit increases to 15% from 10% not to exceed $3,000 per year from $2,000 for those filing single or married filing separately. The cap is raised to $6,000 from $4,000 for married couples filing jointly.
Rader said the measure was an effort to entice more families to adopt.
If kids are raised with a more solid and grounded upbringing, they have a better chance of becoming taxpayers as opposed to becoming involved in the criminal justice system, he said.
Although the dollar amount is not a lot, it seeks to help families out a little bit, Rader said. 
Public notaries
It will cost those seeking to renew or obtain a new public notary commission more money.
Senate Bill 1028 requires a national criminal background check for those seeking to become a notary public. 
It includes the fee for those applying to renew their commission. The fee shall not exceed $50 or the cost of the search, according to the measure.
“A felony conviction shall be grounds for removal of a person from office of notary public and shall preclude a person from further applying for renewing a notary commission,” according to the measure.
The measure also increases the fees for applying for a new and renewed commission.
It raises the required bond to $10,000 from $1,000 and the bond fee to $25 from $10.
Wind energy
A new state law aims to make the skies over wind turbines more aesthetically pleasing.
Senate Bill 713 requires the operators of wind turbines to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval to install certain lighting systems to make them detectable by aircraft within two miles of them.
Sen. Darcy Jech, R-Kingfisher, said the new law came from a request from a constituent who bought a wind farm and didn’t want to see the constant lights at night.
“They only flash when they detect aircraft in the area .. so you don’t have flashing red lights out there continuously,” Jech said.
The language was crafted after a Kansas law, Jech said.
Food stamps policy change delayed 
A new policy prohibiting food stamp recipients from using them to purchase candy and soft drinks was supposed to take effect Jan. 1.
However, Oklahoma Department of Humans Services officials said the launch of the SNAP Healthy Food Waiver program has been delayed until Feb. 15.
“At the request of retailers, the implementation window was extended to ensure both retailers and SNAP recipients have the time they need to adjust after the holiday season,” the agency said in a statement.
The federal government approved the state’s request for the change, which will be effective for two years.
In an executive order, Gov. Kevin Stitt said he requested that the Department of Human Services seek federal approval for the change to reduce “preventable diet-related health issues like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.”

Do you remember the Legislature trying to seize Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming’s proposed Mount Rushmore, or the 100-foot-high flames near Green River Lakes?
The post Bird-dogging DOGE, trailing chems, saving the Tetons and crossing corners in 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","My older sister, Christina Isabelle Thuermer, is likely relieved that 2025 is fading because she’s ready to hear from me about something other than corner crossing now that the Supreme Court resolved the infamous public land access case.
For years, my sister, a retired teacher of the theory of knowledge at Washington International School, has bemoaned my coverage of corner crossing. I’ve written so many articles — about 80 since 2021 — it’s hard to count them. They were all about a lawsuit that claimed $9 million in damages from a person momentarily passing through the air above private property without touching the land itself.
After getting the gist of Fred Eshelman’s airspace trespass claim that challenged public access to public land, Tina, who lives just outside Washington, D.C., became exasperated at every new article. The lawsuit, in her view and likely that of her students, was a case of reductio ad absurdum. Did the suit contend that even Thin-Mints-selling Girl Scouts would need a law degree merit badge before crossing a front yard to make a doorstep sale? 
Well, Tina, you can relax in 2026. The U.S. Supreme Court this fall declined to hear the case, effectively ending the saga in favor of the hunters and public access. It remains legal in Wyoming and five other states to step from one piece of public land to another where they meet at a single point, even if one passes through the airspace above private property.
And if you didn’t read all my other stories, sis, here’s a quick review.

President Trump’s administration carried out a Valentine’s Day massacre of sorts in Wyoming, firing dozens of federal workers and pushing others out through DOGE downsizing. WyoFile put multiple reporters on the story. For my part, I stood outside federal office buildings, waiting for folks to leave with a box of family photographs and other desktop mementos.
That’s after I unsuccessfully staked out the Teton County Courthouse, waiting for the unscheduled arrival of a warranty deed giving Grand Teton National Park the 640-acre Kelly Parcel school section. The deed was driven across Wyoming in a snowstorm and filed about 6 minutes after the official close of business. We missed that story by a few minutes that day, but the end result was the preservation of a precious landscape.
If you think costs are up in your home of Arlington, Tina, where eggs were up to $11 a dozen, you should try building a dam in Wyoming. The estimated costs of the Alkali Creek and West Fork dams have ballooned so much that lawmakers are beginning to balk at once sure-fire infrastructure projects.

Our late parents will be pleased to know I went to church this year. However, it was for an assignment: to remember Charlie Kirk. I was able to show in a photograph the respect and sadness dozens had for the assassinated conservative influencer.
A fire commander described 100-foot-high flames at the Dollar Lake Fire that ran through dry and dead trees near Green River Lakes. Rob Wallace, who was instrumental in the Kelly Parcel preservation, received the Murie Spirit of Conservation award from the Teton Science Schools and recalled his grandfather’s successful push to create city parks in towns across Wyoming.
Speaking of new parks, the Legislature couldn’t get on board with the idea of creating Wyoming’s own Mount Rushmore to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence next year.
Although the Legislature passed a bill that made preservation of the Kelly Parcel possible, that didn’t stop some lawmakers from advocating for the takeover of Grand Teton National Park and most of the rest of the federal public land in Wyoming. They failed.
The U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources came to Grand Teton National Park to hold a hearing on how to best spend conservation money. Within 10 days, however, conservation groups said MAGA forces continued their assault on public lands, seeking to end the protection-oriented U.S. Forest Service Roadless Rule and Bureau of Land Management Public Lands Rule.

In 2025, Utah’s Sen. Mike Lee also proposed a “mandatory disposal” plan for federal land holdings in the West. A large and boisterous crowd gathered in front of the Wyoming State Capitol to send the message public lands are “not for sale.”  While his budget measure failed, Lee remains dedicated to his goal.
The Trump administration and its congressional allies dismantled the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, overwhelming the efforts of Wyoming’s own Ruby Calvert, who was sitting as chair of the independent group.
Wyoming’s mountain athletes earned championship honors. Downhill racer Breezy Johnson, who skis under the Jackson Hole logo, won two world championship gold medals, and mogul skier Jaelin Kauf raked in three international titles in her discipline.
In other mountain news, Exum climbing guide Jed Porter visited the landmark Second Tower of the Grand Teton, a feature that partially collapsed in 2022. He didn’t know it at the time, but he was missed by another huge rockfall that occurred just before he passed the pinnacle.
We dug into archives to report on the last letters another Exum Guide penned to his wife just before he was killed on Mount Everest in 1963. Jake Breitenbach was one of a handful of Teton climbers who played an outsized role in climbing the famous West Ridge of Everest.
Also in the stratosphere — chemtrails. I sat through eight hours of a committee meeting about claims the government is poisoning all of us by spraying toxicants from commercial airliners.
Finally, an archivist who was thumbing through old stuff uncovered a story about how a famous documentary photographer’s image of a Wyoming ceremony was used on the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street album. Robin Everett, an archivist at the Wyoming State Archives, stumbled on the link between Casper’s Hotel Townsend, photographer Robert Frank and the Stones and helped bring an exhibit of Frank’s work to Wyoming.
I reminded Tina today that the Wyoming corner-crossing saga is over, for now. “Oh, thank God,” she said.
Have an enjoyable 2026.

In a state where abnormal weather is the norm, even Wyomingites marveled at a wild month that broke more than just temperature records.
The post Wyoming smashes December heat records. Seasonal snow reports mixed. appeared first on WyoFile .","It was a balmy, gusty Christmas for much of Wyoming, where only high elevations in the western portion of the state saw fresh snow. It rained in Jackson Hole while lower elevations in central Wyoming saw temperatures in the 60s with 60-plus mile-per-hour winds, according to reports.
The holiday was a continuation of a theme in which weird and wild weather defined much of December as high-pressure systems lingered over the region for the better part of three weeks, the National Weather Service in Riverton said. Residents and travelers alike battled sustained high winds from border to border, and a Dec. 19 blast measured 144 miles per hour — Category 4 hurricane speed — at Mount Smoot in western Wyoming. Another wind blast the same day tossed a train off the tracks near Cheyenne, BNSF Railway confirmed.

Wyoming High Patrol responded to 39 blow-over accidents in just three days in December, according to state officials. 
As the wind wreaked havoc, nine Wyoming locations saw unseasonably high temperatures averaging 13 to 22 degrees Fahrenheit above normal from Dec. 13 through Dec. 27, according to the National Weather Service. Both Lander and Casper are on track to notch their warmest Decembers since 1892 and 1948, respectively, NWS Riverton meteorologist Adam Dziewaltowski said. Casper, as of Monday, had marked 10 record-breaking daily highs, while Lander saw a record high of 65 degrees on Christmas Eve.

Yet for all the bluster and heat, meteorologists caution against reading too much into what it might portend for the remainder of winter. Cold and snow returned over the weekend, and the state frequently receives most of its snow in early spring, sources say. 
Currently, Wyoming’s “snow-water equivalent” is above average for most of western Wyoming, while areas on the east side of the state lag behind late December norms. Central-east and southeast Wyoming are the driest, with the southeast measuring just 5% of its typical snow-water equivalent, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on Monday.

But even in some areas of the state, like Jackson, where precipitation is above average, a portion of the wet stuff has come in the form of rain instead of snow.
“Right now, [Jackson is] almost two inches above normal for precipitation — liquid-wise,” Dziewaltowski said. “They’ve definitely gotten precipitation, but it’s been so warm that it hasn’t fallen as snow.”
Some high elevations have seen rain-on-snow events, which can create adverse conditions for slides, Dziewaltowski added.
Though the weather took a turn after Christmas, swinging from the balmy 60s to below zero in just 48 hours in some areas, the forecast calls for more unseasonably warm temperatures later this week, according to the Weather Service.
December’s wild and warm conditions made for odd outdoor experiences.
Laramie angler Eric Wiltse posted his December fishing outings to Facebook and confirmed with WyoFile several “alarming” seasonal observations. Early this month, he waded into Twin Buttes Lake, which had been frozen just days before. He saw rain at 7,200 feet of elevation, and while fishing in Curt Gowdy State Park on Christmas Eve, he shared the open water with other outdoor enthusiasts who typically don’t appear in the winter.
“Crazy to be fly fishing on Christmas Eve at 7,500 feet in Wyoming,” Wiltse posted. “Even crazier to see a paddleboard on the lake.”

Cheyenne’s Ronn Jeffrey reflected on lessons learned from his decades-long career in juvenile justice with columnist Kerry Drake.
The post Take time to understand kids. It’s what keeps them out of trouble. appeared first on WyoFile .","When a weed-loving teen returned to Cheyenne’s Youth Alternatives as an adult looking to become a volunteer, Director Ronn Jeffrey took the opportunity to “go fishing” for a success story about the organization’s impact on young people.

Opinion

“What happened to make you change?” Jeffrey asked. 
The man’s response wasn’t a testimonial about how well the program worked, but it did something even more valuable. It confirmed a belief about the juvenile justice system that the director had held since starting Youth Alternatives in 1971: What works to keep teens out of trouble is much different than for adults.
“I loved smoking dope,” the potential mentor to a new generation told Jeffrey. “If I lit up a joint right now, I’d be happy. You used to tell me how bad it was for me, but that went in one ear and out the other. Half the time I was listening to you, I was stoned.”
So, if it wasn’t sage advice from a respected adult, what did make him give up marijuana? “It was a girl,” Jeffrey said. “She was much more important than anything I could have said to him. She told him, ‘You can have me or have the dope, but you can’t have both.’”
It’s a lesson that has served Jeffrey well, especially after he was appointed Cheyenne Municipal Court’s juvenile judge in 2006. I’ve known him since the 1970s, when I wrote articles about Youth Alternatives as a Wyoming State Tribune reporter. I interviewed the 75-year-old Jeffrey again recently after he retired as a judge and learned more about his career and how he intends to keep working to help his community’s children.
“We must find out what motivates kids to want to change their behavior,” he said. “One of the things that’s wrong with the juvenile justice system is that it tries to adjust the adult system and make it work for kids. But the brain development of a child at 16 is very different from an adult’s way of looking at life.”
An adult would obviously be highly worried about anything that might jeopardize his or her freedom, like going to jail, Jeffrey said. But adolescents may be more concerned about peer pressure and what happens when they don’t fit in.
Jeffrey has long viewed the courts as a last resort for troubled youth, though he sees his former judicial role as an essential way to hold them accountable for their actions.



“The more our system is punishment-driven, what you’re basically doing is teaching kids how to be criminals,” Jeffrey said.
There are several programs throughout the country that focus on trying to scare kids into leading law-abiding lives. Jeffrey said they don’t work because “you can’t scare kids straight.”
It’s easy to see how Jeffrey — a man with a deep voice and towering stature — could strike abject fear into the heart of a young offender, especially in his judge’s robe. But punitive approaches taken in courtrooms, jails or classrooms don’t stick, he said. Most teens don’t feel threatened as soon as they leave that environment.
Jeffrey started in Cheyenne’s juvenile probation office, but soon transformed it into Youth Alternatives and changed the focus to counseling, court services and volunteer mentoring. The program saw 300 to 400 kids per year and has helped several generations of Cheyenne residents.
After a few years of suggesting that I volunteer as a mentor to see what the experience was like, Jeffrey wore me down in the early 1980s, and I signed up. It was everything he prepared me for: The challenge of developing rapport with a 15-year-old boy, meeting with his family and talking about the problems that brought him to Youth Alternatives.
We soon developed a weekly routine: See a movie, get something to eat, or just take a walk and talk. During Cheyenne Frontier Days, the program gave us tickets to the rodeo. I knew very little about cars, but my mentee did, and he got mine running several times. I paid him by giving him my 8-track tape collection; I definitely got the better of the bargain.
That’s how I viewed the entire experience. I think I got more out of it than he did, and being able to ask Jeffrey and the staff questions when I was stumped about issues I felt unprepared to address made me realize that it really does take a village to raise a child.
“It’s amazing what kind of a difference it makes when you get everybody involved,” Jeffrey said. “It’s important to make kids understand that everyone wants them to succeed. But they have to do more work themselves because if they don’t work to change, it’s not going to happen.”
Jeffrey said one of the things that’s helped the program be successful is its reliance on volunteers, because children know that the adults aren’t getting paid and are just there to help them. 
Initially, Jeffrey’s office only saw kids who were referred by the courts, but he believed “it was important that we not just have this isolated group of kids who were in trouble.” Soon, the program took referrals from schools, neighbors, parents and anyone who knew a child who might benefit from the services.
Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins has one last assignment for Jeffrey after his retirement. He’s leading a new volunteer group with representatives from law enforcement, prosecutors, judges and local officials to examine the best juvenile justice practices here and in other communities. The group will review juvenile ordinances and make recommendations to the city council, which can codify any new solutions.
“We truly just want to take [Jeffrey’s] energy and his knowledge, and see if he can help us set ourselves up for the future,” Collins said.
Jeffrey said he’s looking forward to his new role, particularly because as a judge he could only enforce local ordinances, not advocate for changes.
This may be billed as Jeffrey’s “final” job in juvenile justice, but I’m not buying it for a second. So long as kids need help, Jeffrey will be there tackling the problem. It’s in his blood, and it’s who he is.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The 2026 election cycle begins early for some Arkansans who can start casting ballots in two special legislative elections that were the focus of legal challenges over their timing.
Early voting begins Tuesday for the elections in Senate District 26 and House District 70.
The seats became vacant following the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch and the resignation of Republican Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock. Wing stepped down to take over the helm of Arkansas PBS, which this month announced plans to disaffiliate with PBS.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders originally scheduled the Senate District 26 special election for Nov. 3, 2026, the same day as the general election. Sanders later revised the date to June 9, following bipartisan pushback that the November date would leave constituents without representation during April’s fiscal session. 
Lawmakers are expected to discuss funding for a controversial prison project in Franklin County, which is located in Stubblefield’s district, during the session. Stubblefield was an outspoken opponent of the prison project. All the of candidates running for his seat have said they oppose a prison in Franklin County.
Following legal challenges, the special elections in both Senate District 26 and House District 70 were ultimately moved to March 3, with primaries in each contest scheduled for Jan. 6. [2026 Primary Election Voter Guide: The candidates, the ballot measures, and the tools you need to cast your vote.]
To help you stay informed with these special elections and the 2026 primary elections, the Advocate has launched a 2026 election page and voter guide. Both have information about the House District 70 race where Alex Holladay will face Cordelia Smith-Johnson in the Democratic primary on Jan. 6. The winner will meet Republican Bo Renshaw on March 3. 
Meanwhile, Senate District 26 voters can cast a ballot on Jan. 6 in the Republican primary, which features five candidates — Mark Berry, Wade Dunn, Brad Simon, Stacie Smith and Ted Tritt. 
If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the two candidates with the most votes will meet in a runoff election on Feb. 3. The winning Republican candidate will then face Independent candidate Adam Watson on March 3. 
To be eligible to vote Jan. 6 in the special election primaries, residents in those districts must have been registered to vote in Arkansas by Dec. 8. You can check your voter registration and polling locations here.
Early voting in both races will be available on Dec. 30-31, Jan. 2 and Jan. 5, but times and polling sites vary by county.
In Pulaski County, voters can cast their ballot in the House District 70 Democratic primary from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Pulaski County Regional Building in Little Rock or First Christian Church of Sherwood. 
Senate District 26 includes portions of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. Early voting in Franklin County is scheduled for 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Charleston Courthouse and the Ozark Training Room in Ozark. 
Johnson County voters can cast early ballots from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Johnson County Courthouse in Clarksville, according to election coordinator Angela Scott. 
Meanwhile, Logan County voters can cast their ballots from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Jeral Hampton Meeting Place in Booneville or the Office of Emergency Management in Paris.
In Sebastian County, early voting is scheduled from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Sebastian County EMS Training Room in Greenwood.
The Advocate will continue updating its voter guide as the special elections and primary elections are decided. A voter guide for the November 2026 general election will be published in the spring once primary election results are finalized.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)During the holidays, we’re bringing back our journalists’ favorite stories of 2025. This one’s from May. 
Lynn Bonner: “Republicans taking the majority on the North Carolina Board of Elections and hiring Sam Hayes, a former top aide to Republican House speakers, is a turning point in North Carolina’s voter and voting access stances. 
“Hayes and the new board are adhering to GOP orthodoxy on voting. Noncitizen voting is rare, but sussing it out is a priority for vocal GOP voters. Hayes is also pressuring the North Carolina DMV to supply his office with voters’ full Social Security numbers. 
“The GOP majority on the state board started a slow roll-back of Sunday voting during early voting periods and is posed to allow more limits. Sunday voting has been a longtime target for North Carolina Republicans.”
The new Republican majority on the state Board of Elections in its first meeting voted to replace elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell with Sam Hayes, general counsel to House Speaker Destin Hall. 
This is the first state elections board with members appointed by the state Auditor.
Democrats Jeff Carmon and Siobhan Millen, members of the last board, joined the Republican members state Auditor Dave Boliek announced last week: Francis DeLuca, a former president of the conservative Civitas Institute, former state Sen. Robert Rucho, and lawyer Stacy “Four” Eggers. Eggers is also a returning member. 
DeLuca won the board chairmanship with a 3-2 vote. Democrats wanted Eggers for chairman.
In the past, a majority of the election board’s members were of the same political party as the governor. After Democrat Josh Stein won the governorship last year, the Republican legislative supermajority passed a law stripping governors of their power to appoint members. That lead to the new majority-Republican elections board.
Republicans had been trying to reduce or eliminate the governor’s elections board appointments for years. Those efforts were rejected by the courts and voters.
Brinson Bell was hired as the state’s top elections administrator during former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s tenure. While the state and local boards won national awards for election administration, Brinson Bell was a target of state Republicans’ criticism.  
She took heat from Republican legislators over a lawsuit the board settled concerning absentee ballot deadlines in 2020, even though she told legislators she had nothing to do with the negotiations. 
The state GOP sued the Board over the decision to count absentee ballots that voters put in the wrong envelope, and over 225,000 voter registrations the GOP said were not legal because they lacked a partial Social Security number or a driver’s license number. Republicans also objected to instructions from the state board that local boards should not try to do their own signature matching for absentee ballots. 
The legislature consistently appropriated less money than the Board of Elections requested for staff and technology. 
GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin’s unsuccessful effort to win a seat on the state Supreme Court even though he was behind in the vote count was based on legal arguments that the Board of Elections had misinterpreted state law.
The new NC Board of Elections, with all members appointed by the state Auditor, are sworn in on May 7, 2025. Left to right, Jeff Carmon, Chairman Francis DeLuca, Stacy “Four” Eggers, Siobhan Millen, and Robert Rucho.
Political divisions over Brinson Bell’s leadership lasted until the end. Republicans on the board voted to adjourn Wednesday’s meeting rather than allow her to read a statement. 
Millen said it was “a shabby way to treat a nationally admired executive director.”
Brinson Bell read her statement after the board adjourned, and Republican board members had left the room. 
She said serving as executive director “I know will forever be the greatest honor of my life.”
She noted the hostile conditions elections officials sometimes face. Elections officials are targets of suspicion and threats. 
Brinson Bell said she hopes for a return to civility. 
“I hope we can get to a place in this country, and especially in this state that I hold so dear, where dedicated, hardworking election workers are supported and rewarded for their work, rather than vilified by those who don’t like the outcome,” she said. “I hope we return to a time when those who lose elections concede defeat rather than trying to tear down the entire election system and erode voter confidence. And I hope we recognize that the conduct of elections is the very core of our democracy and should be properly and consistently funded, regardless of the party or the person in control, so that the voice of the people can be recorded accurately, securely, and fairly.”
Brinson Bell said later she was not referring to Griffin’s effort to throw out votes when she talked about losers conceding. 
Carmon read a list of Brinson Bell’s accomplishments, including an elections plan for Helene-devastated counties that resulted in higher voter turnout there than statewide. 
“That was your leadership,” he told her. 
She ran elections in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and the following year during the COVID-19 pandemic, recruiting thousands of poll workers, Carmon said. 
Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Senate leader Phil Berger called Brinson Bell “a partisan actor.”
“I’m hopeful that the changes we’ve made, we’ll see the decisions made by the board based on what the law is, not what the board thinks the law should be,” Berger said.





Republicans on the elections board have tended to dislike Sunday voting during early voting periods.





DeLuca filed a federal lawsuit over same-day registration in 2016 when he was Civitas Institute president.
In a brief interview, DeLuca said it was too soon to say what changes Republicans will make, but he wanted “gradual improvement in everything.”
Hayes, who will start his new job as elections director next week, said “it’s far too early to get into that,” when asked about any changes he is looking to make.
“I think we all have the same goal, which is election integrity,” he said during a brief interview in his office in the Legislative Building. “Make it easy to vote, hard to cheat, and I think we’ve accomplished a lot of that here with legislation that I’ve been a part of that I’ve later had to defend in litigation. 
“We’ve laid out the blueprint, and that is the law,” he said, “and that’s what I intend to stick to, and take the direction of the Board.”
Hayes said he still has legislative work to do. This is a busy time for the House. It voted on dozens of bills this week to meet a procedural deadline. House budget writers are scheduled to roll out their spending proposals next week.

Newsline analyzed data […]","Attendees listen to speakers at a rally against a Colorado bill that would allow local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law on Feb. 25, 2025, at the Colorado Capitol. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Data shows over 3,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Colorado through mid-October this year, as the Trump administration and federal government ramp up detention and deportation efforts.
That’s over four times the number of arrests from the same time period in the last year of the Biden administration.
Newsline analyzed data available through the Deportation Data Project, which obtains data from the federal government through Freedom of Information Act requests and posts them online. The data includes information about arrests and detentions in Colorado until Oct. 15 this year.
The rate of immigration enforcement arrests sharply increased when President Donald Trump took office in late January, compared to trends in 2024. There were 734 arrests in Colorado between Jan. 1 and Oct. 15, 2025, compared to 3,230 arrests between the same time period in 2025.
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest deportation operation in the history of our country,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.

The year saw high-profile ICE operations in major cities across the county, billions of dollars in new funding for the agency and pressure from top government officials to meet a daily arrest quota.
Last year in Colorado, the daily arrest average rarely exceeded 10 per day, but there were several time periods in 2025 with much higher daily arrest numbers. That includes highly-publicized operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at Aurora and Denver apartment buildings in early February and a raid at a Colorado Springs nightclub in April.


Monique Sherman, the Detention Program Managing Attorney at the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said that the data matches her expectations, and that a much larger share of detained people she saw this year were apprehended internally — at work, home or during a traffic stop — rather than at the border. That was the experience of about 88% of people the organization worked with in 2025, compared to an estimate of less than 10% in 2024.
Historically, people would move from a border facility to the Aurora facility while their removal proceedings moved through the system, Sherman said.
“Now, we barely interact with anyone who came from the border. In 2025, we saw 52 people who came straight from the border out of 430,” she said. “It’s a huge flip, and it makes sense considering the various policies of the administration.”
Most of the people arrested by ICE in Colorado this year did not have a criminal conviction. Twenty-six percent had a pending criminal charge, and 36% were arrested on an immigration violation and did not have a criminal record. That tracks with a national trend, where arrests are up but the share of criminal convictions is down.
ICE often publicized the criminality of people it arrested through news releases, including in a July release in which the agency claimed it arrested people who “pose a significant threat to public safety,” including one person wanted for murder, five people wanted for a sex offense and nine people with a drug offense charge.
The most common “most serious charge” designation for immigrants detained in Colorado in 2025 was for driving under the influence. That data comes from an analysis of information from the Deportation Data Project about people detained in the privately-run ICE detention center in Aurora and in ICE hold rooms in Denver, Colorado Springs, Puebelo, Alamosa, Frederick, Craig, Grand Junction and Durango. ICE inputs the information, but the terminology can be inconsistent. There were 12 entries for “drug possession” but also eight entries for “heroin.” Newsline combined any drug-related entry to count towards a drug offense category for its analysis.
The next most common charges were for assault, drug offenses, traffic offenses and illegal reentry into the country. There were 16 people detained by ICE who had a homicide charge and 52 people with a sex offense charge.
Denver County had the highest number of arrests at 1,548 during the time analyzed. The next highest counties, in order, were El Paso, Arapahoe, Mesa, Adams and Pueblo. There are gaps in the released data and media reports of ICE arrests, such as in Summit County. Only two arrests were listed in the data, but organizations like Voces Unidas told media that at least ten people were detained during a September operation in Frisco and Dillon.
There were 293 arrests listed as taking place in “FRD General Area,” which the Deportation Data Project believes refers to the region surrounding an ICE field office or sub-field office. FRD would be code for the Frederick sub-field office, which covers Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, Weld, Morgan, Logan, Washington, Yuma, Phillips, Sedgwick, Kit Carson and Cheyenne counties.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Auditor Allison Ball feels a “sense of urgency” to get answers for Kentucky’s youth on delayed help for kinship care families and the problems keeping foster children sleeping in office buildings, among other things.
In an end-of-year interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Ball said 2025 was “an incredibly busy year” full of “really meaningful work” for her office, which has investigated Medicaid, preschool and broader education issues, medical cannabis, juvenile justice issues and more since she took office in 2024.  
She also headed up a legal fight against the Beshear administration over a 2024 law to get financial assistance to families raising minor relatives, known as kinship care families. 
Her lawsuit, which sought to make the Cabinet for Health and Family Services implement the 2024 unfunded law and cooperate with a related investigation, was dismissed by a judge in September. Her office has since appealed that decision.
She also subpoenaed the cabinet, a process she said in the December interview is taking longer than she’d like. 
“I’d like to say that’s proceeding in a really positive way. It’s not yet,” Ball said. “We’re still having a slow walk on that and it’s disappointing this has taken as long as it has, because this is something that really needs to be implemented as soon as possible. These are real needs, real people at stake, and we’re doing all we can to speed it up, but we’re still running into roadblocks and issues getting that information from those people.”  
She’s eyeing the metaphorical clock, as well. The 2026 legislative session starts on Jan. 6, and during the 60-day session lawmakers will craft the next state budget. That time constraint is “definitely part of our calculation,” Ball said. 
“That’s why I’m actually somewhat frustrated that we’ve gotten to this point now, because we’re running up on session,” she said. “I’d love to be able to provide them with more, very clear, information,” she said.
If the General Assembly does not fund this law in 2026, it could potentially have to wait another two years, for the next budget cycle, if another solution isn’t found before that. 
On the ombudsman and bureaucracy 
Ball has overseen the transition of the ombudsman from the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to her office and led a subsequent court battle over access to a computer database that stores information about abuse and neglect cases. The ombudsman investigates and resolves complaints about agencies in the cabinet, including protective services for children and elderly Kentuckians. 
Having the ombudsman in her office “allows us to focus very intentionally” on the cabinet, she said. It’s also been frustrating to navigate bureaucratic hurdles, she said.  
“Government always has a tendency towards bureaucracy, and, unfortunately, bureaucracy creates real problems when you have vulnerable situations involving children,” Ball said. “I think everybody knows that, everyone knows that that complicates problems, but I think it’s just been heartbreaking to see how this does impact real life people. It’s created a sense of urgency in me to try and get answers quickly, and I’ve been disappointed to see how long and how slow it is to get things resolved.” 
2026: Education and medical cannabis 
In 2026, Ball said her office will continue working on issues that she uncovered in her audit of the education department, including making sure school officials who abuse children are recorded as abusers in a database accessible to other schools. 
“There’s a whole gambit of things that we identified through our audit, and so that was a nice starting point to be a preview for what we’re going to be doing next year,” she said. 
She also expects to release an audit of Jefferson County Public Schools, a district she said is a “great test subject” when trying to figure out problems within schools and address them. 
“We’ve taken our time with that one and one reason, too, is I thought we could also use that as a model for other school districts throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky,” she said. “Everything that happens in Jefferson County probably happens in some way throughout Kentucky, whether you’re in a rural area or an urban area.”
She will also continue looking at Fayette County Schools, which faced scrutiny this year over a proposed tax increase.
“We’re zeroing in on the finances (in) Fayette County because they’ve had their issues over the last year,” Ball said. “I had wanted to do a big one, like we’re doing with Jefferson County, but we’re probably going to be focusing primarily on the finances, at least in its initial stages. It’s possible that we’ll deal with some other issues, maybe, in a second audit, but the finances are such an urgent issue with them that we need to get that one out as soon as possible.” 
Another issue likely to make headlines in 2026 out of Ball’s office is her investigation into how the state’s Office of Medical Cannabis (OMC) processed license applications. 
She announced this investigation in April and in October received “over a million pages of documents,” which her staff is still digging into. 
“We’re still reviewing all that, going through it,” Ball said. “And we’re still asking for some information from them.” 
On her political future

Ball is eligible to run for reelection as auditor in 2027. Or she could choose to run for another office, or nothing at all. When asked about her future political plans, she said she’s focused on the remaining time of her term as auditor for now. 
“I’m only in the middle of my first term as state auditor,” she said. “I’ve been so encouraged while I’ve been here for the last two years about: You can do meaningful work in this office and shine light on things and fix problems. I am highly motivated in the work that I’m doing right now, and I’m zeroed in and focused on these next two years, doing really good work.” 
When she started her term as auditor, Ball said, she didn’t quite expect so many of her special examination projects to revolve around children. 
“As a mom, that’s something that I always find highly motivating. It’s just not something that I necessarily thought we’d be able to touch on very much in this office,” she said. “But just as it so happens, there have been several … big issues that really do deal with children in a variety of circumstances all over the Commonwealth of Kentucky.” 
What comes next is “something you pray about and you discuss with your family,” she said, “but I love the work that I’m doing right now.”

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)With a new year just days away, I want to express my gratitude to you for your continued trust in the work of the Pennsylvania Capital-Star. It’s hard to believe it’s been more than 10 months since I started as the editor-in-chief, but what a ride it’s been so far.
Before I get into our most read stories of the year, I just want to peel back the curtain a bit for you.
Over the course of 2025, the team has worked to bring you deeper reporting on how policy decisions made in Harrisburg and Washington D.C. are impacting you and your fellow Pennsylvanians. From the reductions in federal funding and workers and the annual state budget impasse to  how data center growth is driving up electric prices and the longest federal government shutdown in history, the Capital-Star focused on under-the-radar developments to give you a better understanding of how your tax dollars are being used. 
The team also worked to keep you informed when breaking news occurred, including the attack on the Governor’s Residence and the tragic shooting deaths of three police officers in York County. 
Behind-the-scenes, we expanded where our work is available in an effort to meet you where you are – such as adding an audio reporter whose stories are available free to any radio station and posting a weekly recap of our top stories on YouTube and Instagram every Friday.
Judging by some of our numbers, you and your fellow readers responded positively to our efforts. The Capital-Star saw a 6% increase in page views and nearly 6% jump in number of readers – a year *after* a topsy-turvy presidential campaign and election, which had Pennsylvania again in the national spotlight. 
But I am most overwhelmed and grateful when it comes to how many of you chose to support us with your hard-earned dollars. Our fundraising figures just smashed several previous records at the Cap-Star – including highest total (doubling last year’s figure), new donors, number of contributions and most reactivated donors. 
Your donations also make it possible for us to continue to provide statewide reporting to your fellow Pennsylvanians who may not be in a financial position to give. 
I understand you have a lot of options when it comes to what organizations you support, but your belief in the work we produce – whether you just read our stories each day, subscribe to our morning newsletter, or contribute financially – is never taken for granted. We go into every story trying to ensure you are educated about what is happening in the commonwealth.
Thank you.
Now, let’s get into the 10 stories that attracted the most readers:
Numbers 1-3
The first three stories are on a topic that on the surface doesn’t seem like an “attention grabber:” The Trump administration terminated $13 million in funding for Pennsylvania farmers who provide products to food banks across the commonwealth. 
But, a closer look shows how the issue would resonate. The move took away a needed revenue stream for farmers. The program had bipartisan support. Food banks lost much-needed produce and dairy products. It wasn’t, by all accounts, a wasteful government program. 
The Trump administration’s decision drew so much attention that our coverage of it landed in the top three slots – by far – on this list. 

Trump administration drops funding for Pa. farmers who help  food banks. Shapiro moves to reverse it



‘A deal is a deal’ Shapiro says of Trump cuts to funding for Pa. farmers providing for food banks



Republicans and Democrats agree: Federal funding of farm and food bank program should be restored


Number 4
In the fourth slot is a reaction piece in the wake of Congress passing the reconciliation bill. Gov. Josh Shapiro, in a press conference, was highly critical of the members of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation who voted in favor of it.

Gov. Shapiro says Pennsylvania “got screwed” in the reconciliation bill signed into law.


Number 5
Longtime Pennsylvanians remember the 2003 repeal of the law requiring motorcyclists to wear a helmet. So when a state lawmaker proposed reinstating the measure, it got people’s attention. Peter Hall’s story on state Rep. Manuel Guzman’s plan comes in at number five.

Number 6
The debate over whether Pennsylvania should legalize recreational marijuana has been ongoing for years, especially with most of its neighboring states doing so. Ian Karbal’s story comes in at number six, and has been hanging around in our top 10 for several months. 

Pa. House passes a recreational marijuana bill that would put the state in charge of sales


 Number 7

A new federal rule boosted the pay of more than 2,100 hourly federal workers in Pennsylvania at the start of the year. The move came a couple of months before the federal workforce was thrown into chaos by Elon Musk’s DOGE effort to cut jobs and departments. This story from  late January lands at our seventh slot. 

Fetterman touts new federal rule boosting wages for thousands of federal workers in Pa.


Number 8
Those federal job cuts had an effect on Pennsylvania and Ian Karbal’s deep dive into the impact (along with an interactive map) provided readers with a detailed picture of the job losses. His story comes in at number eight.

Trump’s cuts to federal workers have taken their toll on Pa. More are coming


Number 9
President Trump’s implementation of massive tariffs hurt Pennsylvania businesses and farmers. When Mack Trucks announced plans to lay off between 250 and 350 workers at its Lehigh Valley Operations center outside Allentown, the company pointed to economic uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs. I remember Peter Hall and I having a quick conversation about the story: An iconic Pennsylvania company having to trim its workforce due to the administration’s trade policies certainly rose to the level of a statewide story. It wasn’t a long, detailed piece, but people took notice. It lands at number nine.

Mack Trucks announces layoffs at Lehigh Valley plant, blames tariffs


Number 10
In the 10th and final slot, private equity companies that own hospitals took center stage when a for-profit health care company closed its remaining two hospitals in Pennsylvania’s fifth most populous county. The combination of a community losing key health care facilities and the larger issue of for-profit entities in the industry resonated with readers. Peter Hall’s piece rounds out our top 10 most read stories of 2025.

Through a strategic mix of capital, ideology and political influence, CSF and its allies are advancing a powerful message: that market-driven “choice” is the only remedy for supposedly irredeemable public schools.
Once public schools are cast as broken beyond repair, charters and microschools become steppingstones toward something far more consequential: a broad voucher system that redirects public money to private and religious education. The Daniels Fund, whose donation seeded CSF, has long championed vouchers. Their investment signals the next phase, a push to convince parents that privatization is not only desirable, but inevitable.

The consequences are profound. This approach doesn’t merely siphon resources away from neighborhood schools; it erodes their legitimacy. When foundations and political operatives rebrand public education as a failure, they create the very conditions they claim to solve. And as public confidence collapses, the argument for taxpayer-funded private schooling becomes easier to sell.
That dynamic is already playing out in Pueblo, where Riverstone Academy presents an alarming test case. Operating under Education reEnvisioned BOCES, the school has marketed itself as a public elementary school while pushing a Christian curriculum. Ken Witt, head of the BOCES, even described Riverstone as “Colorado’s first public Christian school” during a board meeting last fall. Yet the school’s official paperwork made no mention of religious instruction. Was the omission accidental or intentional?
The backstory suggests the latter. Emails show Brad Miller, a lawyer for Pueblo County School District 70, requesting permission to establish a new school inside the district’s boundaries but governed by neighboring District 49. The arrangement, he wrote, would allow the group to work with Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal organization known for high-profile religious liberty cases to test “the legalities around the issue of whether a public school may provide religious education.”
Riverstone Academy appears designed as a legal provocation: a taxpayer-funded public school created to force a battle over whether public dollars can support explicitly Christian instruction. This is not a misunderstanding. It is a strategy, one aimed at normalizing religious schools operating with public funds.
This local experiment unfolds alongside a national effort to redefine public education. The Trump administration’s recently passed federal voucher bill casts public schools as a “monopoly” in need of disruption, echoing decades of market rhetoric. But as Kevin Welner of the National Education Policy Center warns, the supposed “flexibility” states gain under the bill is illusory. Instead, it invites federal overreach, weakens student protections and replicates the academic declines already associated with large-scale voucher expansion.
Those protections matter, especially for LGBTQ+ students and families. Behind the lofty language of empowerment lie schools that quietly, and sometimes openly, exclude them. Across the country, private schools participating in voucher programs deny admission to LGBTQ students or the children of LGBTQ parents. Some embed exclusion in handbooks or “morality clauses”; others teach explicitly anti-LGBTQ doctrine. Yet taxpayer dollars increasingly subsidize these institutions under the banner of choice.
The Douglas County School District’s “Choice Scholarship” program, a voucher initiative struck down in court, would have funneled public funds to religious schools with documented histories of exclusion. As Gregory M. Lipper of Americans United for Separation of Church and State put it, “Taxpayer money can’t be used to fund religious schools or religious education.” Voucher systems blur that principle, and families who accept vouchers lose crucial federal civil rights protections, including those guaranteed by Titles VI and IX, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and even constitutional rights to free expression and due process.
When a Colorado district court ruled in 2011 that Douglas County’s program violated the state constitution it reaffirmed a moral commitment: that public education, however imperfect, rests on the promise that every child, regardless of identity, belongs.
If we abandon that promise in pursuit of “choice,” we are not expanding opportunity. We are narrowing it. And for LGBTQ+ students, the cost of that illusion may be nothing less than their place in America’s classrooms.

Virginia received $893.5 million from more than 23,000 international students at its colleges and universities from 2024 to 2025, according to the Association of International Educators (NAFSA).
After contributions to Virginia, international students face uncertainty due to Trump’s visa changes

The organization’s analysis, conducted by JB International, warns that restrictive federal policy changes, such new four-year caps on visa validity, may deter international students. Rachel Banks, director of public policy for NAFSA, noted that in response, schools are adapting by allowing extended deferrals or online starts to maintain international student engagement and mitigate potential enrollment losses.
“I think schools are really trying to be flexible with all the uncertainty,” said Banks, adding that the organization is actively advocating for more welcoming policies and improved visa processing.
Banks also pointed out that few institutions are immune to the changes. Smaller towns with universities in Lexington and Harrisonburg, for example, are particularly vulnerable to enrollment changes, as their economies are tied to university populations and spending. Lexington is home to the Virginia Military Institute while Harrisonburg hosts James Madison University, both public institutions.
Surprisingly, Banks said community colleges are also in the cross-hairs of declining enrollment, with international students contributing over $2 billion nationally.
There is growing global competition for international students, Banks said, stressing that without proactive, student-friendly policies, U.S. institutions of higher learning will struggle to remain competitive, risking program cuts and decreased class enrollments that could impact financial stability.
“… If we continue to find ourselves in the situation where international students are not wanting to come here anymore, and they’re choosing to either stay home or go to another international destination … we need to be out there if we want to have any chance of trying to turn the ship around,” Banks said.
Shortly after speaking with the Mercury, in a statement NAFSA expressed concern about the Trump administration expanding the international travel ban from 19 to 39 countries, effective Jan. 1, 2026. The organization noted that Nigeria, a key source of students, is among them.
Existing visa holders are exempted.
“Blanket travel bans based on entire nationalities or visa categories do not make the United States safer. In fact, they do the opposite. They make us weaker,” NAFSA said in a statement.
Additionally, NAFSA cautioned that expanding the travel ban undermines U.S. global engagement, security, innovation, and competitiveness, and urged policymakers to reverse the decision to protect the national interest.
 International student enrollment in Virginia

On Dec. 1, State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Executive Director A. Scott Fleming said overall enrollment at Virginia colleges remains steady, but graduate international student numbers declined from fall 2024 to fall 2025. He noted this is significant because graduate students often pay full tuition and provide economic benefits to schools.
“International students tend to pay full tuition; they bring with them considerable additional economic resources when they enter the commonwealth to study, and so the reduction and decline of international student enrollment will absolutely have an impact on some of our public four-year institutions,” Fleming said.
Some institutions, especially in Northern Virginia, had larger-than-average declines, Fleming told a Senate Finance and Appropriations subcommittee on Dec. 1 — over 13% in some cases.
On a more positive note, Fleming said undergraduate international student enrollment has increased year over year, which was unexpected based on past data.
Fleming did not specify the causes of these trends, but emphasized the need for the state and institutions to address the resulting financial and operational challenges ahead of the upcoming General Assembly Session.
He also said the state must continue supporting public institutions to help keep tuition affordable, and suggested enhancing need-based financial aid and the Tuition Assistance Grant program.
The first day of the legislative session is Jan. 14, 2026.
