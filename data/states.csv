The latest ruling is arguably the most sweeping yet.,"In summary
The judge has previously sided with UC scholars several times since June in halting Trump’s termination of science and health research funding. The latest ruling is arguably the most sweeping yet. 


A California federal judge ruled today that Donald Trump cannot demand that UCLA pay a $1.2 billion settlement that would have imposed severe limits on the campus’s academic freedoms and efforts to enroll an economically and culturally diverse student body or risk continued funding freezes on grants the system relies on for research
The decision by Judge Rita Lin is a preliminary injunction and represents a significant victory for University of California scientists, professors, graduate students and other researchers. They and a national professors association sued Trump in September, claiming that his settlement demand — the most sweeping to date in his war on exclusive universities — represents an “unlawful threat” of funding cuts to coerce the university system into “suppressing free speech and academic freedom rights.”Lin agreed with that assessment, calling Trump’s actions toward the university “coercive and retaliatory.” Her ruling doesn’t just apply to UCLA. It largely ties the hands of the Trump administration to target the rest of the UC system for current and future research grants.
“Agency officials, as well as the President and Vice President, have repeatedly and publicly announced a playbook of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding, with the goal of bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,” Lin wrote in her ruling.Lin wrote that this same playbook is occurring at the UC.“With every day that passes, UCLA continues to be denied the chance to win new grants, ratchetting up Defendants’ pressure campaign,” she wrote. “And numerous UC faculty and staff have submitted declarations describing how (the Trump administration’s) actions have already chilled speech throughout the UC system.”
Lawyers for the federal government had argued that a federal court cannot block a federal agency from making a decision that hasn’t occurred yet, such as whether to approve new funding for a pending grant.“Notably, Plaintiffs’ fears about future grant suspensions and their claims about the likelihood of constitutional violations are entirely based on speculation about an opening settlement offer between the federal government and UC,” U.S. Department of Justice attorneys wrote to Lin.The legal documents in the case spanned 700 pages and included written testimony from more than 70 UC professors, staff workers and graduate students. 
The settlement demand and lawsuit
Trump’s settlement demand is a 27-page document sent to UCLA in early August that would have required the top-ranked public university to hire a senior administrator to review diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; limit campus protest; bar the campus’s medical center from performing gender affirming surgeries or hormone therapy on minors; deny admissions to foreign students with “anti-Western” sentiment and other restrictions.
The public was first able to see the document in late October after some scholars filed a separate lawsuit in state court to force UC officials to disclose the settlement demand.The settlement demand emerged a few days after the Trump administration froze more than $500 million in health and science research funding to UCLA over allegations that the campus tolerated antisemitism and enrolled students using racial preferences. Had UC agreed to its terms, the Trump administration would have released the frozen funds back to UCLA.
However, months before Trump sought the settlement, UCLA had already taken steps to address antisemitism on campus after its leaders commissioned a task force to recommend ways to create a more welcoming environment for Jewish students.Lin faulted the administration for disregarding UCLA’s efforts. The agencies did not “mention the remedial steps UCLA had already taken to address the issues described,” Lin wrote.UCLA is legally barred by state and federal law from admitting students using racial preferences. Trump’s demands would have also blocked UCLA from a practice the U.S. Supreme Court condoned: allowing students to discuss their racial identity in their personal essays. 
But almost all of that funding that Trump froze in July had since been restored after a separate wave of legal filings prompted Lin to temporarily undo Trump’s cuts in August and September.Lin has emerged as a key bulwark for UC researchers as she’s ordered the Trump administration several times to undo hundreds of millions of dollars in science funding cuts to the University of California, including roughly $500 million in science and health grant funding suspensions to UCLA alone. Between June and today, she’s sided with UC researchers and staff four times in rebuffing the Trump administration’s efforts to halt funding to scholars. Her initial ruling that has served as a basis for other preliminary injunctions against Trump was upheld by a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.UC faculty associations, among the plaintiffs in the case, wrote to Lin that some of its members who don’t have tenure and are international scholars now hesitate to teach issues related to Israel and Palestine or lead lessons on the health effects of climate change. Other scholars say they fear taking part in protests or other free speech activity due to fears about the government’s reprisals.“I am a mother, and the threat of jail time or federal involvement or oversight in campus policing would give me new fear” about protesting, wrote Hannah Appel, an anthropology professor at UC Santa Cruz, in a court document.
Faculty groups also argued that a $1.2 billion hit to UCLA would affect the whole system, as UC leaders would likely pull funding from other campuses to help UCLA absorb the loss. UCLA’s budget is around $13 billion, including its medical and hospital programs, while the UC system’s  is more than $50 billion — and a third of that comes from federal sources.UC President James Milliken called the situation “one of the gravest threats in UC’s 157-year history.” 
The ruling and evidence in detail
Lin’s written ruling mirrors the comments she made during a 90-minute hearing last week, in which she said that the Trump administration has told universities, including the UC, that “if you want the funding restored, then agree to change what you teach, change how you handle student protests (and) endorse the administration’s preferred views on gender.”“Defendants have submitted nothing to refute this,” she said then..
Twenty-one labor unions and faculty associations sued Trump and 15 agencies, including the top providers of science research funding — the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, NASA and the Department of Education that together award the UC more than $4 billion annually. The UC system itself is not part of this suit but has received sustained pressure from students, staff and faculty — including hundreds of Jewish ones — to reject Trump’s settlement.
“This agreement violates the very foundations of higher education,” the UC undergraduate student association wrote to Gov. Gavin Newsom, UC’s president and campus chancellors in November. 
Faculty and staff wanted a return of all terminated grants and a block on denying funding to any pending grants that were preliminarily approved by science panels but were stalled for seemingly political reasons.  
Other faculty, staff impact
The UC has cut the hours or laid off more than 250 lecturers and librarians since Trump began his term this year, said Katie Rodger, the president of UC-AFT, the union of lecturers and librarians at the UC. Lecturers are a core part of the instructional staff at UC but generally lack guarantees of continuous employment that other professors enjoy.
The federal fiscal picture is a reason why at least some lecturers have received pink slips. The “School of Humanities has incurred budget reductions over the last four years, which have been compounded this year by national and state level budgetary impacts and planning projections indicate substantial future budget shortfalls,” said a termination letter at UC Irvine this past spring. 
And while lecturers do not lead labs that receive federal grant funding, they work in them. The loss of grant funding “already has and it will continue to impact us going forward,” Rodger said of lecturers during an interview. The union in August wrote a letter to UC’s director of labor relations leadership demanding that the system cease negotiations with Trump over the settlement.
Meanwhile, the dean of the largest college at the UC — the College of Letters and Science at UC Davis — wrote to faculty last month that it’s dealing with a $20 million budget shortfall across this year and next, after absorbing a loss of $6.7 million the past five years. “Budgets for faculty and graduate student employment will reflect these reductions,” the dean, Estella Atekwana, wrote. That would affect most lecturers.Several scholars and staffers wrote to Lin that the administration was freezing funding on pending grants that UCLA researchers would have likely received if Trump didn’t target the campus. One of those projects was supposed to go to Marcus Roper, a mathematics and computational medicine professor who submitted a grant to research how to better predict vision loss in adults with diabetes. 
The proposal also included a program to teach K-12 students how to apply algebra to analyze eye health. Roper showed in court filings that two grants he submitted won the recommendations of the agency’s program directors, but those were pulled when the Trump administration suspended all of UCLA’s existing NSF and National Institutes of Health grants. Even after Lin ordered Trump to restore the existing grants the agency suspended at UCLA, NSF personnel told Roper they were ordered to pause approval of funding for new grants.Also at UCLA, the NSF preliminarily approved the renewal grant for a math research program that’s been funded for 25 years, but also pulled it in July. If the program isn’t reupped again, Richard Bartlebaugh, a video producer, will lose his job months before he’s eligible for his pension and the program will close in May of 2026, he wrote to Lin. “In this scenario, my time at (the institute) will have represented a four-year and eleven-month career misstep.”
Trump didn’t follow rules, lawsuit said
Catherine Lhamon, formerly the top official during the Obama and Biden administrations at the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education, wrote to Lin that the way the Trump administration pulled funds was illegal. 
“What (the office) cannot do under the law — and what we never did — is move to immediate fund termination.”But that’s what the administration did. And as Lin noted in her ruling and comments during last week’s hearing, Trump officials bragged about it.“We’re going to bankrupt these universities, we’re going to take away every single federal dollar,” said Leo Terrell on a FOX News program in March. Terrell heads the Trump administration’s multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. His interview was submitted by lawyers for the UC workers as evidence. “The academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists” he also said.
Llamon, who’s now a faculty member at UC Berkeley, wrote that federal law requires the agency to go through a lengthy process of warning a campus of any civil rights violations, such as ones dealing with antisemitism, and allow the campus to come to a settlement with an action plan. Sometimes the Office for Civil Rights leads an investigation at the school and encourages campus leaders to undertake policy changes. All of that occurs before the federal government pulls funding from a school.  While in charge, her office struck deals to combat allegations of antisemitism at numerous universities, including the UC.“Termination of funds was, as is required in statute and regulation, a last resort, and in the thousands of complaints my office received, we never needed to take this step,” she wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/040825_UCLA-Funding-Cuts_JH_CM_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 21:01:22.005075

More than three dozen Hamtramck voters have been disenfranchised after three non-election officials walked into the city clerk’s sealed office on election night, compromising the security of absentee ballots that were mistakenly left there.
The Wayne County Board of Canvassers deadlocked Friday on whether to count the 37 ballots, which were discovered in that office the day after Election Day, having been opened but not removed from their envelopes. Because the board didn’t have a majority of votes in favor of counting them, the ballots will not be included in the final tallies of the election.
It’s not clear whether officials at any level are obligated to tell those 37 voters about the fate of their ballots. Greg Mahar, Wayne County’s director of elections, said he wasn’t aware of any requirements around that. State officials said they weren’t aware of any regulations on that either.
Those uncounted ballots could have been pivotal for the result of the closely contested, open-seat mayoral election in the city, which borders Detroit. According to unofficial results, engineer Adam Alharbi currently leads City Council member Muhith Mahmood in the race by only 11 votes.
At issue in the canvassing board’s deliberations was the ballots’ chain of custody, which must be maintained to ensure the results of the election are accurate and legitimate. Clerk’s offices are sealed around the time of elections, meaning only election officials come into and out of places where ballots are stored.
Due to what officials have said was human error by those who were counting absentee ballots on election night, the 37 ballots in question were opened but never counted. Upon noting a discrepancy in the numbers, election officials looked for the ballots, City Clerk Rana Faraj told the canvassers at their meeting Thursday, but did not find them until the next day. Those ballots were then sealed in a secure envelope and brought to the county.
But the clerk and her team later realized that three other city officials, including interim City Manager Alex Lagrou, walked into the office late on election night, Faraj said. That broke the chain of custody of those ballots, casting doubt onto whether they could be counted.
It’s uncertain why Lagrou and the other officials entered the office. Lagrou could not be reached for comment Friday. It’s not clear who the other non-election officials were.
Becki Carmargo, assistant corporation counsel for Wayne County, told the canvassers on Friday that the board had precedent to reject the ballots based on similar cases in the past. She recommended that the ballots be rejected.
The Democrats on the board, Richard Preuss and Edward Keelean, both argued the votes should be counted. Preuss, the board’s vice chair, said he would like to see affidavits or sworn testimony from the officials who entered the office, because “throwing out votes without having evidence is reckless.”
“I haven’t seen any evidence saying there’s any fraud,” he said, “and to say that these 37 don’t count because of an allegation of potential fraud is completely contrary to this board’s sworn duty.”
Lisa Capatina, a Republican and the chair of the board, argued that such an investigation would be outside of the power of the canvassers. The canvassers are ministerial, she said, meaning their primary job is to confirm the election results.
The canvassers ultimately voted along party lines, and the 2-2 deadlock means the ballots will not be counted.
The mayoral election now hinges on 120 cured ballots tabulated during the canvasser’s meeting Thursday. Those will be taken into the count on Tuesday as the board finalizes the canvas.
Mahmood, the currently trailing mayoral candidate, told Votebeat before the meeting that he hoped the canvassers “did the right thing.”
“At the end of the day, those are people’s votes,” he said. He declined to comment further after the meeting.

Larry Rhoden announced Friday in Sioux Falls. Under the program, South Dakotans who owe federal income taxes can either send up to $1,700 to the federal government, or they can donate that $1,700 […]","South Dakota Gov.

Tony Venhuizen (right) and St. Joseph Academy students stand around him. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota is the fourth state in the country to commit to President Donald Trump’s federal education tax credit program, Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Friday in Sioux Falls.
Under the program, South Dakotans who owe federal income taxes can either send up to $1,700 to the federal government, or they can donate that $1,700 to a government-recognized scholarship granting organization to public, private or homeschool entities in the state. The program starts in 2027.
Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced the state’s commitment in September. Republican governors for North Carolina and Tennessee announced their commitment this summer. Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin officials said they do not intend to opt into the program. Some critics nationally have questioned whether there will be proper guardrails, accountability and “quality control” in place.
Rhoden called the imminent program a “winning situation” for South Dakota taxpayers.
“I’d just as soon give those dollars to a private school than Uncle Sam,” Rhoden said at the announcement, standing in front of a row of students attending the St. Joseph Academy. “I think they know how to spend it a little wiser than the federal government.”
Rhoden added that the federal tax credit will “pair well” with South Dakota’s existing tax credit program, which allows insurance companies to donate up to a total of $5 million to a private school scholarship program for students whose families have low incomes.

The program will further support the state’s growing alternative instruction movement, Rhoden said, including homeschooling and microschools popping up throughout the state. Alternative instruction enrollment has nearly tripled in South Dakota in the last decade, making up about 7% of school-age children in the state.
Sara Hofflander, founder of St. Joseph Academy, said the school is “grateful” for the potential extra funding, though she plans to “approach everything cautiously.”
“Running an independent school obviously requires a heavy commitment from families,” Hoffman said, adding that the extra funding would “lift some of that burden, so we can focus more on the needs of our students.” 
Historically, “school choice” efforts in the state have met resistance from the public school industry. 
Advocates vehemently fought former Gov. Kristi Noem’s effort to introduce Education Savings Accounts, which would have provided public funding for private education and homeschool options during the last legislative session, calling the failed effort an attack on public education. Those same advocates referred to the state’s education tax credit program as “backdoor school voucher program.”
But Rob Monson, executive director for the School Administrators of South Dakota, said the program will benefit public and private education. South Dakotans can direct their tax credit dollars to organizations representing public schools in the state. The funding could be spent on not only tuition and fees for private schools, but tutoring, special needs services for students with disabilities, transportation (such as busing), afterschool care and computers.
South Dakota Department of Education fails to reach goals in legislative performance review

“That’s a huge win for taxpayers of South Dakota, but also every form of education across the state,” Monson said.
South Dakota Education Secretary Joe Graves said the program will support education innovations and a “robust competitive system.”
Graves told lawmakers on Thursday, while presenting lackluster test scores to a committee, that “innovation” would be key to improving student outcomes, especially for Native American students and children living in “education deserts.”
“We’re not doing well enough, and we need to do better,” Graves said at Friday’s announcement.
If more students attend private or alternative schooling options, that would mean less state funding for public schools because of decreased student enrollment. Monson told South Dakota Searchlight that state revenues could be impacted by participation in the tax credit program, since it would remove federal tax dollars used to support other programs or go toward states. The federal government would still be obligated to fund some federal education programs, Monson added.
The scholarship funds would be available to families whose household incomes do not exceed 300% of their area’s median gross income. The U.S. Department of Treasury is expected to issue proposed rules detailing the program’s operation.
Graves said he assumes there will be reporting “at some level” of how the funds are spent.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/591A2359-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 19:57:21.188237

Col. David “Boar” Gunter told the Idaho Legislature’s Committee on Federalism that the number of personnel could increase to perhaps 300 people – in Qatari personnel and U.S. personnel – as the training program reaches its full operational capabilities. Overall the training program could last for 10 years, he said. 
Gunter told Idaho legislators that plans for the Qatari training program have been under development for several years, and the squadron would be a U.S. flag squadron under the leadership of the U.S. Air Force.
“The program builds on the United States Air Force’s long standing tradition of hosting allies and partner nations for training with similar programs as to several Air Force bases here in the United States,” Gunter said.
 Training with allies to prepare for combat

Gunter said the ability to train with allies with Qatari Emiri Air Force at Mountain Home Air Force Base helps ensure they will be prepared to serve with multinational forces during more stressful, high stakes combat missions in the future.
“The United States Air Force and United States government relies on our allies and partners to multiply our capabilities and to continue to provide the safety and security that we provide around the world,” Gunter said. 
Gunter made a sports analogy to describe the training, saying a team of football players who practice and train together will perform at a higher level with better unity during high-stakes game situations.
“That is very similar to the advantages that we get by training with our partners and allies before we are in a very stressful situation that is air-to-air combat,” Gunter said. 
In addition to Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel, Gunter told Idaho legislators the Qatari personnel may bring dependents such as spouses or family members with them, but Gunter said it was too early to know details.
 Idaho’s elected officials were surprised by Qatari facility announcement

On Oct. 10, Hegseth announced the deal to train Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel at Idaho’s Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
In televised remarks, Hegseth said, “Today we are announcing that we are signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho.”

That same day, Hegseth took to social media to clarify his remarks, writing “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States – nor anything like a base.”
The announcement caught U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, Gov. Brad Little and other officials off guard, records obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun revealed. 
Late last month, Risch, Little, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, all R-Idaho, wrote letters asking Hegseth for a briefing on the Qatari training deal and answers questions about logistics and national security.  
Risch also spoke to the Idaho Legislature’s Federalism Committee on Friday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Risch, who serves as chairman of the U.S Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Idaho’s entire congressional delegation’s staff was meeting Friday morning with the Department of Defense to “find out exactly what happened” with the training program announcement.

Risch said the purpose of the Mountain Home Air Force Base is to provide training for aviators from the United States and its allies. Risch said U.S. allies from all over the world train on F-15 and F-16 aircraft at Mountain Home Air Force Base.

“People come from all over the world – not our adversaries – but people who are allies,” Risch said Friday. 
“Go out there any day and you’ll find people from all over the world training out there,” Risch said. 
Risch told committee members that Qatar is a U.S. ally and the U.S. operates a military base there. 
“Being careful of what I say here, they are not a perfect ally of ours,” Risch said. “But we have a huge military base in Qatar. It’s got thousands of soldiers, sailors, Marines, aircraft, ships – everything. If there’s ever a blow up in the Middle East, our war will be fought from Qatar because they host our base there.”
When it comes to the Mountain Home Air Force Base training deal, Risch stressed that the United States controls that base and Hegseth’s announcement doesn’t change that. 
“Nobody has control of that except the American government,” Risch said. 
 Several Idaho legislators voice concerns about Qatari Emiri Air Force training deal

After Gunter delivered his prepared remarks to the committee, several Idaho legislators voiced concerns about the training partnership with Qatar.

“I would assure you that Idaho has an unwavering support for you and the members of our Air Force, but when it comes to this, the support is waning greatly in the population,” Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood, said. “I’m getting dozens and dozens and dozens of emails and phone calls with great concern that we are yoking ourselves and bringing people here that have been speculated to be a major funder of terrorism in other parts of the world.”
Sen. Cindy Carlson, R-Riggins, also told Gunter that she has concerns and has heard from many concerned constituents.
“I just want to go on record that I have concerns about this process about aligning ourselves with a known country of … sponsoring terrorism,” Carlson said. 
Gunter told the Idaho legislators there is a rigorous vetting process for everyone brought on the Mountain Home Air Force Base that takes about 30 days to complete. Gunter said there would be certain areas on the base and certain information the Qatari Emiri Air Force personnel would not have access to. Gunter also said there are numerous other security measures in place on the base that he could not disclose but that he said he had total confidence in.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The General Assembly’s Democratic and Republican leaders assembled for a rare committee meeting Friday afternoon to consider requests to audit state waste, both fiscal and physical.
But any action on those asks before the Joint Committee on Legislative Services will have to wait for a future meeting. The five-member panel agreed to postpone action on a GOP request to probe the state’s quasi-governmental affordable-housing finance agency and a separate proposal seeking an assessment of  how much trash and recycling the State House generates.
Lawmakers began their hour-long hearing with a request by House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale to have the state’s Office of Auditor General investigate RIHousing. In September, Chippendale, a Foster Republican who sits on the committee, called for an audit of the housing agency he characterized as “bloated” and inefficient in its mission of tackling the state’s housing crisis. 
“The request for the entertainment of a performance audit is not a reflection of hostility, distrust, or personal criticism of the agency or its staff,” Chippendale told the committee. “On the contrary, it’s rooted in respect for the importance of their work and a deep desire to strengthen the systems that support it.” 
Chippendale provided fellow legislative leaders with a 17-page report by the House Minority Office that “reveals significant concerns related to transparency.” It’s separate from the six-page analysis Chippendale’s office produced in September, which mostly compared RIHousing to its peer agencies in the region.
The report handed out Friday looked at how much RIHousing spent in subsidizing new construction projects with $206 million federal pandemic aid over the last five fiscal years. 
The GOP’s latest findings mirror those in a 2024 analysis by the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC), which found the state’s return on investment for its housing policies and programs has fallen short.
RIPEC in its report had proposed structural changes, such as setting up “strict cost standards” for housing projects seeking state funds and eliminating duplication of state and federal funding programs with a single, streamlined and easily trackable program. 
Chippendale said his office was inspired to independently crunch numbers to analyze RIHousing’s results in increasing housing production in the state.
Out of 42 projects reviewed by the House GOP, 14 of them — 33% — exceeded RIHousing’s own internal cost limits. According to the report, many of those projects exceeded limits by 20% to 140%, with per-unit costs ranging from $514,000 to $639,000. 
“We’ve seen various reporting inconsistencies when it relates to these monies,” Chippendale said. 
Chippendale acknowledged that RIHousing posts annual audits to its website, but he said they’re all purely financial.
“It does not look at efficiency, it does not look at performance, it does not look at output,” he said.
Chippendale said he did not expect any action to immediately be taken as the report had been given to the panel, along with RIHousing the same day as the meeting. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, the Warwick Democrat who chairs the panel, agreed that was fair.
Shekarchi did give RIHousing the chance to respond to Chippendale’s remarks. RIHousing Deputy Director James Comer attended the meeting while Executive Director Carol Ventura was absent.
Comer read a statement from Ventura highlighting $1.4 billion in financing the agency made available in 2024 for affordable housing, first home mortgages and rental assistance.
In addition to publishing financial audits, Comer said RIHousing provides monthly reports on its activities to the state’s Pandemic Recovery Office — which disburses shares of Rhode Island’s remaining federal aid funds for its financing programs.
“That’s what accountability looks like in practice,” he told the committee. “We welcome this hearing as an opportunity to reaffirm who we are — Rhode Islanders can and should have full confidence in how their statewide housing financing agency operates.”

Tackling State House waste
The Joint Committee on Legislative Services similarly held off on voting on a request by Rep. Lauren Carson, a Newport Democrat, to allow a nonprofit that has been setting up ​​composting programs in all of Rhode Island’s schools to find ways to reduce trash inside the State House.
Carson’s proposal calls for the Rhode Island School Recycling Project to look around the Capitol building’s waste receptacles and locate sources of food waste. The idea is to set up a waste sorting program inside the State House.
“We have an obligation in the State House to comply with state law and recycle, to lead by example and to demonstrate to the citizens of Rhode Island that we’re doing the right thing when it comes to waste,” Carson told the committee.
On hand to further sell the idea was Warren Heyman, organizing director of the Rhode Island School Recycling Project.. Heyman told legislative leaders not only would the Rhode Island School Recycling Project do the work for free, but reducing waste in the building could save the state some money once the Central Landfill in Johnston fills up — which is expected to happen in 2046.
“The cost of shipping our trash out of state will only increase,” Heyman said. “Everything we can do — whether it’s in our public schools, this building, or hospitals or nursing homes — that can reduce the amount of trash going to landfill is a dollar saved on behalf of the taxpayers.”
Shekarchi told Carson and Heyman that while legislative leaders have exclusive control over certain rooms in the building, responsibility is shared with the state’s Division of Capital Asset Management & Maintenance.
He suggested Carson and the Rhode Island School Recycling Project connect with the capital asset division before the next meeting, which has yet to be scheduled. Despite the delay, members of the committee underscored the need for a cleaner State House — including Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson.
“We need to consider here in this building what we can be part of this process,” Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, said.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Two state panels charged with setting legislative and statewide elected official pay are set to meet again Tuesday after it was determined an ineligible member voted to raise pay.
The Board on Legislative Compensation and Statewide Official Compensation Commission both posted special meeting notices Friday afternoon after concerns were raised that one of the board’s members was a registered lobbyist. 
According to state law, lobbyists are barred from serving on the Board on Legislative Compensation, which meets in odd-numbered years to set lawmaker pay and leadership stipends.
“It does appear that a board member was prohibited from serving in that position,” said Leslie Berger, a spokesperson for Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, whose office advises both panels. “It is our understanding that House leadership is aware and working to remedy the matter.”
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, appointed James Leewright to the Board on Legislative Compensation. Both panels have the same members.
Leewright is a former Republican member of the House and Senate. He participated and cast votes in both meetings.
Leewright currently is a registered lobbyist, online news outlet NonDoc reported. He serves as the president and CEO of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association and CEO of the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association and the Oklahoma Travel Industry Association.
Caroline Estes, Hilbert’s press secretary, said the special meetings were set after it was determined Leewright was ineligible to serve.
Tuesday would mark the third time the legislative compensation board will have met. Under state law, Tuesday is the final day it can legally convene.
The panels met earlier this week and increased by at least 25% the pay for nearly all statewide elected officials with the exception of the governor. Members also hiked stipends for legislative leaders, but kept legislative pay the same. The pay hikes would not take effect until after the November 2026 elections.
As of late Friday, the agendas for the meetings had not been posted.
Estes said she did not know if every item would be voted on again because each panel sets their agenda.
But Hilbert wanted “to do whatever is fair,” she said.
“Along with the replacement of an appointee, there are multiple outstanding items that need to be addressed,” Estes said. She did not elaborate.
Hilbert has appointed Krista Ratliff, president and CEO of FISTA Innovation Park in Lawton, to serve on the boards.
The legislative compensation board has set its special meeting for 2 p.m. in Room 230 of the state Capitol. The Statewide Official Compensation Commission has set a special meeting for 3 p.m. in the same location.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Salt Lake County says its first confirmed case of measles this year is worrying because it suggests the virus is spreading in the community. 
“This case is especially concerning because the source of the patient’s infection is unknown,” said Dorothy Adams, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department. “They have not knowingly had contact with anyone who had measles, which means their infection is the result of transmission somewhere out in the community.”
The county warned that anyone who went to Intermountain Health’s Taylorsville urgent care clinic on Nov. 7 from 3 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. may have been exposed. The virus is highly contagious and can linger in the air for up to two hours, so it doesn’t need direct contact to spread.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

With that in mind, health department employees were getting in touch with people who might have been in close contact with the patient or visited the same spaces within a few hours. 
The department first learned Wednesday night that someone tested positive. Citing patient privacy reasons, it did not give the patient’s age or gender, or say where the person lives. 
On Oct. 27, the county announced a likely case based on the symptoms of a patient who refused testing. The last time the county recorded a positive test was in 2023, when a Utah resident got infected while traveling out of state, said spokesperson Gabriel Moreno.

Outbreaks happened earlier this year in rural parts of the state, including along the Utah-Arizona border and in Cache County. 
Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prevent more than 97% of infections, the health department said, and those who are vaccinated and still get sick tend to have milder symptoms. Unvaccinated people — including babies too young to be eligible and immune-compromised Utahns — are more likely to experience severe complications. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash that typically begins days later on the head or face.  
For those who don’t know if they’re immune, the county said receiving an additional dose of the MMR vaccine is safe and widely available, including at its vaccine clinics.

After receiving feedback from mental health providers who said the change would put a significant dent in their bottom line, the insurer is taking a step back to evaluate the proposal.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Blue Cross Blue Shield VT postpones controversial change to therapy billing .","Savannah Lord, the clinical director of a Burlington nonprofit mental health clinic, got an email from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont this month and was immediately alarmed, as were many of her colleagues across the state.
What transpired since then provides a small window into the highly complicated world of health insurance in the United States, where even the insurers who set reimbursement rates, and the providers who bill for them, can become confused. That complexity can also get in the way of efforts to improve patient care.
The Nov. 5 email from Tom Weigel, the chief medical officer for the state’s largest private insurer, explained a billing change the insurer planned to implement. Starting in January 2026, unlicensed mental health providers would receive 24% less in payment for services than their licensed counterparts.
The change, Weigel wrote, was intended to encourage those unlicensed providers to complete their licensing requirements, and to align the private insurer’s reimbursement practices for mental health services with those of Vermont Medicaid. The insurer had found upon review that “trainees were practicing for many years without clear progress toward licensure. Some even practicing more than 10 years as trainees.” 
Lord knew right away the change would be a massive financial blow to her clinic, called Eden Valley, which treats patients of all ages. Four of the clinic’s six staff members are pre-licensed supervisees. Nearly 75% of Eden Valley’s revenue comes from patients covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont. 
“This is how we keep the lights on; this is how we pay utilities. This is how we pay our taxes. This is how we function,” Lord said.
Also, something didn’t sit right with Lord about the letter’s explanation of mirroring Vermont Medicaid rates for mental health: The state’s program for lower-income Vermonters has paid the same rate for all of Eden Valley’s practitioners, licensed or not.
“The insinuation that we have been overpaid all of these years is quite scary,” Lord added. 
In the days that followed, mental health providers in and around Burlington quickly rallied against that Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT proposal. They circulated a protest form letter among patients and other clinicians and on the popular Burlington Facebook group Sensi-Babeington. The letters said that the reduction would result in fewer therapists entering training and even further reducing the number of therapists and social workers in a state where they are already scarce, particularly those who take insurance.
This week Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT informed mental health providers that it would pause implementation of the policy to gather more information. 
“We’ve received feedback from some of our network providers who disagree with the change, and we take that feedback seriously,” company Vice President Andrew Garland said in an emailed statement to VTDigger.
“We think we have this right, but we are going to postpone the policy start date so we have more time to discuss the policy change with our network providers and community leaders,” he wrote.

(Mis)alignment with Medicaid
The licensure process is an important part of consumer protection, said Lynn Currier, a licensed inpatient clinical social worker and the executive director of the Vermont and New Hampshire chapters of the National Association of Social Workers. 
The process ensures that practitioners have passed their qualifying exam and that they are participating in the continuing education required to maintain a license, she said.
“When I look at Blue Cross Blue Shield’s reasoning, (and) that they’re seeing people who never get out of the trainee status, they’re not wrong,” Currier said. “There are clinicians who’ve been working decades without a license, because they can work under the license of somebody else, and that’s a problem.” 
But ensuring that insurers and regulators have the tools to assess a provider’s licensure status is complicated. 
One issue is that many types of mental health professionals can practice in the state of Vermont without a license, explained Lauren Hibbert, deputy secretary of state. To practice this way, a provider is required to enroll in what her office calls the roster of non-licensed, non-certified clinicians, giving the state a way outside of licensure to monitor who is providing mental health care in Vermont. 
Some of the mental health professionals on the roster have degrees in psychology, social work or counseling and are working toward full licensure. To achieve that, a trainee must log around two years of practice, meeting with clients and providing clinical care under the supervision of an already-licensed clinician. 
Another group of therapists on the roster may be career-long unlicensed practitioners, who might offer different kinds of mental health therapy, may not be able to pass the licensure exam, or may have not completed their education. There are many mental health care professionals who may never intend to pursue licensure, Hibbert said.

The distinction between the two tracks — those who are working toward licensure and those who stay in this unlicensed, rostered status for long periods — can easily become muddled. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Weigel wrote that the reduction in reimbursements for pre-licensed clinicians “aligns with Medicaid to create consistency, reduce incentives for trainees to remain unlicensed, and focus resources on high-quality, well-supervised care that benefits members.”
But, in fact, it did not align with Medicaid’s rates for unlicensed therapists.
Vermont Medicaid does indeed reimburse many trainees at 76% of the program’s set fee schedule, which does seem to parallel what BCBS VT initially proposed. But, the state program also reimburses many fully licensed therapists the same percentage.
Medicaid distinguishes its billing rates based on the provider’s education status, not their licensure status, explained Alex McCracken, a spokesperson for the Department of Vermont Health Access, which administers Medicaid. 
A psychiatric physician or nurse practitioner receives 100% of the Medicaid set rate for a clinical mental health service. A psychologist with a PhD receives 93% of that full fee; a psychologist with a master’s level degree receives 76% of that allowed amount. This is true regardless of whether they have achieved their license yet. 
This has been the case since the inception of this supervised billing structure, nearly a decade ago, in 2016, McCracken said. DVHA has no plans to change that, she added.
‘We need to get this right’
Still, the concerns of long-rostered, unlicensed clinicians that Blue Cross Blue Shield initially set out to address remain.
Both DVHA and the state’s Office of Professional Regulation are trying to make it easier to tell who is working toward their license and for how long, officials there said. 
Starting in 2026, DVHA will require non-licensed providers to enroll individually with Vermont Medicaid and appear on the claims submitted for reimbursement — rather than submitting under their supervisor.
“This change helps DVHA ensure providers billing under the supervised billing system are working towards licensure,” McCracken explained. 
Previously, the department had tried to address this by implementing a five-year billing limit for rostered professionals. That rule will sunset at the end of 2025, after DVHA received feedback from providers who found the rule difficult to operate under, as it took some people longer to complete their training.
The Office of Professional Regulation is exploring proposals from a 2024 report that recommends changes to better streamline licensure in the state.
One idea, that would require a legislative change, could be implementing two different types of credentials for unlicensed clinicians — one for people training toward licensure and another for individuals who intend to only stay on the roster. Other states, like New Hampshire and Massachusetts, have conditional licenses for trainees working toward full licensure. 
“The public needs to understand that there is a difference between seeing someone who is licensed or someone who is on their way to being licensed than someone who is not licensed and not on their way to being licensed,” Hibbert said. “It makes sense to me that reimbursement follows that.”
In Weigel’s letter to providers, he cited another concern. There is no cap on how many trainees a provider can oversee, “raising concerns about real-time oversight.” The insurer said that some supervisors had reported retaining “all or part” of the reimbursement from their supervisees, leading to worries that hosting trainees might become “a profit center.”
In his statement to VTDigger, Garland said he did not know yet how long this postponement of the rate change will last, but that the insurer will spend the time listening and sharing information with trainees and supervisors. “In the end, we need to get this right for our members. Many Vermonters, including many of our members, are struggling with the cost of healthcare,” he wrote.
Clinicians have their own concerns and criticisms of the current system. Some worry that reducing the amount a supervisee can make will discourage licensed professionals from taking on the administrative burden of a trainee. 
“Supervising a supervisee who’s not yet licensed requires a significant amount of oversight,” said Danielle Bergeron Ingram, a licensed psychologist and the owner of Green Mountain Psychological Associates, in Middlebury. She also sits on the board of directors for the Vermont Psychological Association. 
Bergeron supervises one trainee in her private practice. “Working under my license, there’s a significant amount of time spent reviewing notes, ensuring quality of care,” she said. “I’m reading my supervisee’s notes, any treatment plans, any documents that are produced by the client.” 
With the high overhead cost of going through undergraduate and graduate school to become a therapist, Bergeron Ingram also worries that a lower reimbursement rate will be yet another economic barrier for those trying to become therapists. 
“We are absolutely going to lose people going into the field in the first place.” she asked. “If they’re not compensated fairly, why go into the field?”

Called debris flows, these fast-moving slurries of floodwater and sediment can hurtle down slopes carrying cars, trees and even boulders with them.
They’re like “a flood on steroids,” said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s landslide hazards program. “It’s really hard to stop these things. The best thing to do is get out of the way.” 
Forecasters expect the heaviest rain Friday into Saturday night; predictions are for wet days through next week. Storms may stretch from Santa Barbara County south to Los Angeles County, and could spread inland to parts of Orange County and the Inland Empire. 
Burn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially vulnerable. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean. 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of almost a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires. 
The county has issued evacuation warnings, as well as some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”
The public works department says that most burned properties have been cleared of fire debris, and the rest have been shored up with gravel bags and other materials to keep debris in place. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom also announced today that more than 400 personnel and resources including fire engines, helicopters and search and rescue teams have been pre-deployed to Southern California counties. 
“It’s a pretty serious situation,”  said National Weather Service meteorologist David Gomberg.
By Friday morning, the storm had already unleashed up to 5 inches of rain in parts of Santa Barbara County, Gomberg said, and Southern California is bracing for more. 
There’s also the possibility of thunderstorms, small tornadoes, and a worrying amount of rain hitting the Eaton and Palisades burn scars. Even just a half-an-inch to 0.6 inches of rain could trigger a debris flow in these areas, said Gomberg, who added that his office is forecasting between half an inch to one inch per hour in these areas. 
“And the more you exceed the threshold, the probability of a more damaging debris flow increases,” he said.
We spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, about what to expect. This conversation has been edited and condensed. 
As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I’m hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?
Last January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.

These burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it’s now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There’s still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they’re bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again. 
I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for? 
Landslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we’re most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It’s also called a mudslide. But geologists don’t like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there’s some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you’re in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.
You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow? 
Flash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it’s worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal. 
Now, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don’t have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That’s where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn’t one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down. 
Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?
Southern California’s kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It’s got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that’s what puts the risk up. 
The thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we’ve now made the slopes really vulnerable. They’re extra steep. There’s a lot of people there. That’s why the risk is so high. 
We’ve seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It’s not just a Southern California problem, and it’s not just a California problem. 
Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now? 
Not long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there’s a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day. 
Planners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That’s the best defense against these. They’re not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it’s really hard to stop these things. 
What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts? 
The best thing you could do is, if you’re really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You’re going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who’s closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it’s going to take to cause a problem, and they’ll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there’s a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities. 
If they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes. 
So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts? 
It’s pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021425-EatonFireMudslides-JAJ-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 18:58:27.084444

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas State Library Board approved disbursing $1.37 million in state aid to local and regional libraries on Friday with little discussion.
The board approves payments of state funds to libraries each quarter, and the amount approved Friday was for the second quarter of state fiscal year 2026. The state Department of Education had authorized payment of the first quarter in September, when members of the newly constituted board had not yet been confirmed by legislators and could not officially act.
The State Library operates independently under the umbrella of the education department, and the board’s primary responsibility is to disburse state funds to local public libraries.
The meeting marked the board’s second since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ appointed them under Act 903 of 2025, which dissolved the previous seven-member board and required the governor to appoint new members. Sanders appointed six members in August and has yet to appoint the seventh.
The previous board had clashed with some lawmakers as well as one of its members, National Association of Christian Lawmakers founder and former state senator Jason Rapert, over withholding funds from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content.
The appointment of an entirely new board came after the previous board fought for more than a year over whether it should withhold funding from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content. Elected officials at the state and local levels have tried to regulate public library leadership, funding and content for the past few years.
At Friday’s meeting, board member and former state lawmaker Jack Fortner of Yellville asked whether criteria other than population could be used to determine how much money individual libraries can receive. The state funds currently are apportioned based on the population served by a library.
Saying he thought some smaller, rural libraries are used more often than those serving larger populations, Fortner asked whether data on library usage might help provide more funds for libraries serving fewer people.
State Librarian Jennifer Chilcoat replied that such data might be available and said she’d have staff try to gather it.
Most of the remainder of the board meeting was spent hearing reports from various State Library department heads and a presentation from education department attorney Daniel Shults on state laws affecting the board and its duties.

The casino knew for years  that gambler Mathew Bowyer, an illegal bookmaker from California, lacked a source of funds to support his vociferous appetite for gambling.   
Bowyer, best known for taking sports bets from baseball star Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, who stole millions of dollars from Ohtani, gambled for years at Caesars Palace, despite the hotel’s knowledge that he lacked the income to support his gambling. 
He is currently in prison serving a 20-month sentence for bookmaking and money laundering.
Bowyer was a patron at Caesars Palace from before 2017 until January 2024, the complaint says. The company and its subsidiaries identified “suspicions” about Bowyer as early as 2017, such as his lack of an apparent source of funds. Multiple due diligence checks by the casino revealed Bowyer did not have a source of funds to support his play. 
In 2017, Bowyer made front money deposits of more than $4 million on multiple visits to Caesars Palace. The same year, the casino noted “source of funds/employment could not be determined for Bowyer.” 
The casino received an anonymous call in June 2019, in which the caller identified Bowyer as a “bookie.” The same month, Caesars deemed Bowyer to be “high risk” and once again was unable to verify his source of funds. His play was “elevated” to a Caesars anti-money laundering  because of his “lack of occupation/source of wealth” and “over $2 million in actual loss over the last 12 months.”
The next month, Caesars suspended Bowyer’s account. Bowyer, in response, presented his 2018 tax return to the hotel, which did not lift the suspension. He then provided a statement indicating winnings of just under $3 million from the Cosmopolitan in 2018, and Caesars lifted its suspension of his account. 
In November 2020, the casino again noted Bowyer’s high risk status based on “undetermined/unverifiable” income. 
In May 2021, the casino again noted Bowyer was high risk because of “undetermined current income level” and a “314b request,” a financial form affiliated with the U.S. Patriot Act. 
Caesars suspended Bowyer’s account again in July 2021, noting he may be a bookie. Bowyer, the complaint says, provided tax returns for 2019 and 2020, resulting in the lifting of his suspension in September 2021.
The casinos reported “no revenue found” for three of Bowyer’s businesses in 2022. 
Finally in 2024, he was banned. The company was aware since 2017 that two other casinos had banned the gambler. 
The complaint says Caesars only banned Bowyer in 2024 after news reports surfaced that his Orange County home had been raided by federal agents investigating gambling by unsavory characters in Las Vegas casinos. The Current was first to report Bowyer’s home had been raided in October of 2023.  
“Media outlets reported extensively on Bowyer, including his activities in Las Vegas casinos, his operation of an illegal bookmaking business, and his money laundering activities,” the complaint says. 
Caesars is the second resort company disciplined by the GCB for taking Bowyer’s action. 
Resorts World agreed to a $10.5 million fine earlier this year. 
The GCB is investigating Foutainebleau, where Bowyer gambled, as well.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2211848134-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 18:58:27.084444

(Photo via Google Earth) State regulators have fined a Linn County pharmacy for a drug dispensing error and settled charges of gross negligence against a Jefferson County pharmacy with a warning.
In the Linn County case, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy alleges that on Dec. 24, 2024, a 22-month-old child was prescribed antibiotics to treat pneumonia. A pharmacy technician at the CVS Pharmacy in Marion allegedly gave the child’s mother azithromycin tablets instead of a liquid and failed to provide counseling on use of the medication. The tablets were subsequently returned when the mother discovered the error, according to the board.
The CVS Pharmacy was charged by the board with failing to provide pharmacist counseling upon receipt of a new prescription drug order; failing to review records to identify any issues such as incorrect drug dosages; and dispensing an incorrect prescription.

In order to resolve the matter, the CVS Pharmacy and the board agreed to settlement that calls for the pharmacy to accept a warning and pay a civil penalty of $5,000.
In addition, the pharmacy must also implement a training and remediation plan, specifically with regard to pediatric dosing and milligram/kilogram dosing and the maintenance of a “proper computerized system protocol” that has the capability to catch errors. Pharmacists will be required to double-check the system to ensure errors do not occur.
Board settles case with Fairfield pharmacy
In the Jefferson County case, the Board of Pharmacy charged Summit Pharmacy of Fairfield with willful or gross negligence, alleging that over the previous several years, many controlled substances had been diverted from the pharmacy’s inventory for the personal use of the pharmacist owner at the time.
Since the initial investigation of that matter, Summit Pharmacy has changed ownership and, according to the board, has “embraced changes” to come into compliance with pharmacy regulations. The pharmacy and the board agreed to resolve the charge of willful or gross negligence with a warning.
The board records do not identify the pharmacy’s current owner.
Board records indicate the former owner, Bryan Vander Linden, admitted in 2024 that he had intentionally diverted controlled substances “for personal use” over the course of six years while working at a Hy-Vee pharmacy in Fairfield.
According to the board, Vander Linden’s admission came about after federal agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration launched an investigation into some form of unspecified “discrepancies” at Summit Pharmacy.
The board charged Vander Linden with knowingly making misleading or untrue statements in the practice of pharmacy; habitual intoxication or addiction to drugs; being convicted of a state or federal law related to drugs or the practice of pharmacy; stealing prescription drugs from a pharmacy for one’s personal use; and practicing pharmacy while under the influence of illegally obtained drugs or while impaired by legitimately prescribed drugs.
Vander Linden’s license was suspended last year when he signed an agreement to refrain from practicing. Earlier this year, the board agreed to settle the charges, in part by lifting the May 2024 license suspension and allowing Vander Linden to “return to practicing as a pharmacist at Summit Pharmacy.”
The settlement also stipulated that Vander Linden must pay a $500 civil penalty and participate in the state’s Impaired Practitioners’ Health Program for Pharmacy and submit to any required drug screenings.
As a result of the DEA investigation, Vander Linden was criminally charged last year with acquiring controlled substances through fraud, deception or misrepresentation. Prosecutors alleged he stole 3,800 doses of Oxycodone, 1,001 doses of Hydrocodone, and 428 doses of Carisoprodol.
Earlier this year, he was convicted of the charged offense and sentenced to four years of probation and fined $9,500.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality revived its Natural State Stewardship Program (NSTEP) after a brief hiatus Thursday, inducting a Fort Smith motor factory into the program for its commitments to reduce emissions.
ABB Inc. manufactures electric motors for everything from conveyor belts to solar panels and was inducted into NSTEP’s diamond tier this past summer, but its addition to the program’s ranks was not announced until this week.
The NSTEP program started in 2019 to incentivize environmental stewardship, according to DEQ. Those who commit to voluntarily reducing their emissions, completing energy efficiency projects or other environmentally friendly initiatives can be inducted into one of the program’s three tiers. Members can be considered for perks such as expedited technical assistance for permit renewals or modifications, reduced reporting requirements or advance notice of inspections “on a case-by-case basis,” according to the programs handbook.
Prior to this year, the program had four inductees — Dassault Falcon Jet and Pratt and Whitney, both in the aviation industry; the Arkansas Department of the Military; and ECCI, an engineering and environmental consulting firm. But until this year, the last induction into the program happened in 2022.
To be inducted into NSTEP, companies have to meet permit compliance and “beyond compliance” requirements. Facilities that had “serious violations” of their DEQ-issued permits within a year of applying for the program are not eligible, nor are facilities that have been convicted of law violations or have entered into out-of-court settlements within three years.
The additional, “beyond compliance” requirements vary by the tier a facility applies for. For the diamond tier, the highest tier, a facility has to commit to completing two environmental stewardship projects within a three-year period. At least one of the projects has to be community-based, and at least one “must demonstrate an improvement of performance of either the facility, its activities, products, or services.”
As part of its induction into the program, ABB committed to significantly reducing emissions from its Fort Smith manufacturing facility. It plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, “a central element of its stewardship,” a press release from DEQ said.
ABB will also reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 90%. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources not directly controlled or owned by ABB, such as employee travel and contracted waste disposal.
The company’s local initiative is a garden project with a nearby Boys and Girls Club to teach hands-on gardening skills and reduce food waste.
“What makes this recognition meaningful is not just the title, but the measurable, ambitious commitments behind it,” Department of Energy and Environment Secretary Shane Khoury said at the induction ceremony at ABB’s Fort Smith manufacturing plant. “These are not just abstract goals. They are measurable, time-bound actions that reflect true leadership and responsible stewardship.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5944-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, walks out of the Senate chambers on Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned from the Alaska Senate on Friday to pursue her gubernatorial candidacy, according to a news release from her campaign.
Her resignation follows that of fellow Senate minority caucus member Mike Shower, who represented Wasilla and resigned at the end of last month to focus on his run for lieutenant governor.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, confirmed he received Hughes’ resignation letter Friday.
Hughes’ resignation was expected. She told the Alaska Beacon in October she planned to resign in time for her replacement to be in place before the legislative session begins in January.
“My constituents, they’ve been my peeps all these years. I want to make sure that they have representation from the get-go,” she said on Friday afternoon.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will select her replacement from among a number of nominees to be selected by Republican party officials in her district. Republican Senators must confirm his choice before that person is seated.
Hughes’ replacement must be a Republican and meet the state Constitution’s requirements to hold office.
Hughes said she expects that Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, will be among the nominees for her seat because Tilton has already filed to run for senator in the district. If Tilton were appointed, the governor would then have to select someone to fill the empty House seat.
Hughes was initially appointed to her seat in 2012 by then-Gov. Sean Parnell, which she credits, in part, to the fact that she was already running.
“I think that when a candidate does that, that shows real interest,” she said.
She said she does not expect her departure to cause significant changes because her district reliably produces “reasonable conservative” lawmakers.
Hughes is one of 12 Republicans and 14 total candidates that seek to be elected governor in 2026. Gov. Mike Dunleavy is termed out and cannot seek reelection.
Hughes said she has fond memories of her time in the Capitol.
“It’s a big change, stepping into the gubernatorial race,” she said. “You know, there are unknowns with that, but I have tremendous peace about this. I really did feel that my chapter was closing in the Senate.”
She represented her district for 12 years.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)Hundreds more members of the Tennessee National Guard are expected to arrive in Memphis over the next few days, even as local leaders await a judge’s decision on their petition to temporarily bar the guard from patrolling the city.
As of Thursday, between 140 and 180 members of the Guard were patrolling the streets of Memphis on orders from Gov. Bill Lee, according to Theresa Carlson, a Memphis Police Department spokesperson. 
“Over the next few days, we anticipate the total presence will increase to roughly 350,” Carlson wrote in an emailed statement. “These men and women are working in the community, serving as additional eyes and ears to support law enforcement.”
The Guard personnel are among more than 1,000 state and federal law enforcement officers deployed to one of the nation’s largest majority Black cities as part of the Trump administration-convened Memphis Safe Task Force.
Judge mulls arguments over deploying Tennessee National Guard to Memphis

Late Friday, lawyers representing Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and other elected officials who originally challenged the Guard’s presence filed court papers highlighting the need for the court’s urgent intervention. 
“The upscaling of Governor Lee’s arbitrary and unlawful deployment exacerbates ongoing irreparable injuries to the Plaintiffs and their communities,” the lawyers wrote. 
“The expanding scope of this indefinite military occupation underscores the urgent need for injunctive relief,” they wrote.
Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Moskal has been weighing the request for a temporary injunction to halt the Guard’s activities in Memphis since she held a court hearing in the case on Nov. 5. 
Stockard on the Stump: National Guard could roam Memphis streets for a year

Harris, two state representatives, a state senator and members of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners and Memphis City Council originally filed suit on Oct. 17 seeking to oust the guard, arguing Lee’s deployment of the men and women to Memphis to combat crime and illegal immigration violates the Tennessee constitution and state law. 
The Tennessee Constitution permits the Guard only in “circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion,” they argued. “Even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
The lawsuit also cites state law that entrusts local officials with the authority to determine whether there has been a breakdown in law and order requiring the presence of the guard. 
Guardsmen have been deployed to the city since Oct. 10. Agents with state and federal law enforcement agencies — among them the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security — have conducted traffic stops and made arrests in support of the effort.

Legislators say they will remember Eklund for his mentorship, kind spirit and thoughtful approach to lawmaking. 
The post Wyoming Rep. John Eklund dies appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming State Rep. John Eklund, a Laramie County Republican and rancher, died Friday after a battle with cancer. He was 74. 
First elected to the House in 2011, Eklund focused much of his tenure on agricultural issues and water policy. His colleagues told WyoFile they’ll remember him for his mentorship, kind spirit and his thoughtful approach to lawmaking. 
“John Eklund was one of the finest people I have ever known,” said former Speaker of the House Albert Sommers, who served alongside Eklund for 11 years. “It was an honor to serve with someone who had his incredible heart and integrity.”
Gov. Mark Gordon ordered the Wyoming State Flag to remain at half-staff at the Capitol and in Laramie County until sunset on the date of Eklund’s internment. It was already at half-staff in honor of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who died Nov. 3.
“Wyoming has lost a dedicated public servant, a steadfast advocate for agriculture, and a man whose kindness touched everyone who had the privilege to know him,” Gordon said in a statement. “Jennie and I hold his wife, Suzi, and the entire Eklund family close in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.” 
Eklund “brought a steady hand, a gentle spirit, and a deep commitment to Wyoming’s agricultural community, work that earned him respect on both sides of the aisle,” Gordon said. 
That respect included Laramie Democrat Rep. Karlee Provenza, who served with Eklund on the House Agriculture, State and Public Lands and Water Resources Committee. 
“There was never a doubt in anyone’s mind that John Eklund cared deeply for the people of Wyoming and his district,” Provenza told WyoFile. “He led with his heart and treated everyone with compassion and kindness despite any contention our chamber was grappling with. I will miss his calming and loving presence and think about him often.” 
Jackson Democrat Mike Yin said, “it’s going to be hard for Laramie County to replace him,” and “I am thinking about Suzi and their family during this time.”
In the 2025 general session, Eklund co-sponsored successful bills to limit eminent domain for energy collector systems, to bolster private landowners’ rights to build fencing along state land and to create easements for local roads on state lands. 
He also brought legislation earlier this year to support veterans, including a bill to update the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum in Casper and to build a new veterans’ home in Buffalo.

Eklund chaired several committees throughout his time in the Legislature, including the House Agriculture Committee, Select Water Committee, as well as the House Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee. 
During its Friday meeting in Cheyenne, the Joint Education Committee took time to reflect on Eklund’s service to the state. 
Eklund and Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, were part of the same freshmen class of lawmakers in 2011. 
“So I’ve served with him my entire time I’ve served in the Legislature,” Rothfuss told the committee. “He was such an incredibly positive, kind, friendly, supportive person that really thought highly of the Wyoming Legislature, the institution. And so he served with class and with honor and certainly with endless hard work.”
“John was kind of a mentor to me, a great encourager in my first term,” Rep. Martha Lawley, R-Worland, told the committee. 
“He cared about new legislators, and he was willing to step in if you were open and receive that encouragement, guidance, those kinds of things. So it’s a loss, and we need more men and women like him in the Legislature,” she said.
Rep. Bob Davis, R-Baggs, told WyoFile he also benefited from Eklund’s mentorship. The two had first met about a decade earlier when Davis was a conservation district representative. 
“But then it was really unique when I got elected as a representative. John was there to greet me as a freshman,” Davis said. “And he helped me, showed me the path in the House, and what to look for and things like that. His insight was tremendously helpful to me.”
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, said that he admired Eklund for his kindness and his devotion to his community — as was shown, Neiman said, by his district’s decision to have him represent them for so many years. 
“I think he did a wonderful job of trying to be very fair, and really kept his constituents, I believe, at the forefront of his mind,” Neiman told WyoFile
The Wyoming Republican Party, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Secretary of State Chuck Gray also issued statements of remembrance. 
Long before he was a legislator, Eklund grew up in Albin, where he was boyhood friends with former lawmaker Dan Kirkbride. The two played sports and did FFA together. 
“He was just one of your nice friends from a good, rural family growing up,” Kirkbride told WyoFile. “And that’s who he was, and then he became all of that when he was an adult.”
As a lawmaker, Kirkbride said, “for him, it wasn’t war. It was an opportunity to serve.” 
“His family should be very proud of the man that he was,” Kirbride said. “I’m sure that they are.”
(Disclosure: Kirkbride serves on WyoFile’s board, which does not have authority to direct news coverage or news content.)
Sen. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, served with Eklund when he was in the House. The two ranchers would go on to become family friends. 
“He was the epitome of a family man,” Crago said, adding that Eklund would travel all across the state to watch his grandkids run track and play sports. 
“He was just a great human being,” Crago said. “It’s a huge loss for the Legislature. Huge loss for the state. We were lucky to have him while we did.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)In the first days of the federal government shutdown, North Carolina officials were wary of an already extensive recovery from Hurricane Helene hitting even more obstacles.
Over 43 days, the longest shutdown in history, state leaders rushed to prevent key federal programs from lapsing and ensure that rebuilding in the mountains could continue, even as Washington stood still.
Now, with the shutdown in the rearview mirror and federal workers back on the clock, North Carolina appears to have avoided any major stumbling blocks in hurricane recovery.
“Time is of the essence, always, with recovery,” Matt Calabria, who leads Gov. Josh Stein’s recovery office for western North Carolina, told reporters Friday. “So delays in getting reimbursements are material, to local governments in particular. But a lot of the broader … concerns that we had we’ve worked really hard to figure out how to avoid.”
Two programs paid for with federal dollars were set to lapse during the shutdown: one that provided crisis counseling, and another to hire displaced workers for recovery-related jobs. Both have since been extended.
U.S. Department of Agriculture county offices are reopening across the state. And the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development, which oversees a $1.4 billion pool of money to rebuild homes destroyed by the storm, is back to full capacity after weeks of skeleton staffing.
North Carolina officials have not been able to use that HUD money, but have been able to lean on a separate bundle of state dollars to keep their homebuilding program, Renew NC, running.
“Our folks estimate that has cut months off the clock,” said Calabria.

While the state has managed to tread water during the shutdown, many local governments are struggling to stay afloat.
The already laborious process to get paid back for rebuilding costs slowed to a crawl during the shutdown, leaving cash-strapped communities desperate for repayment. FEMA assistance continues to flow — the agency announced $155 million in aid last week — but bureaucratic hurdles are frustrating local officials.
Kevin Leonard, executive director of the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners, said the federal repayment process had effectively created a “recovery gap.”
“Accountability should not become red tape,” Leonard told state leaders during a meeting of the governor’s advisory committee on Helene recovery. “It’s resulting in major cash flow strains across our cities and counties.”
Local governments would benefit, he said, from waivers that would allow them to bypass reviews for routine payments like debris cleanup. DHS requires any payment over $100,000 to be signed off on by Secretary Kristi Noem and be cleared by the Department of Government Efficiency. Leonard says that’s leading to longer waits.
Ryan Cody, the town administrator for Marshall in Madison County, said Friday it was “really frustrating” to navigate the extensive reimbursement justification process when the results are already tangible — in the form of parks, sidewalks and a water treatment plant. He asked state officials to search for solutions to get money “directly appropriated” so projects wouldn’t face further delays.
“We have advocated for not having to jump through those additional hoops,” Calabria said, emphasizing that conversations with federal officials are ongoing.
A flurry of deadlines are approaching for local leaders and groups to apply for more funding. Over the next two months, applications are due for local government capital grants, recreation projects, broadband repairs and volunteer-led rebuild grants.
And the state’s most expansive program — single-family home rebuilding and repairs — stops accepting applications at the end of the year. As of Friday afternoon, the program has almost 4,700 active applications, according to state data.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3427-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The University of Alaska is anticipating an increase of up to 10% for health care costs this fiscal year, on par with what employers are anticipating nationally, according to officials presenting to the Board of Regents at their meeting on Nov. 6. 
Nikole Conley, chief of human resources for the university system, gave a presentation outlining the university system’s health care costs so far, and projections for the rest of this fiscal year, ending in July 2026. Her presentation included medical, dental and pharmacy care. 
“We do see health care costs across the nation going up and increasing, and we’re not necessarily expecting this to decline anytime soon,” she said.
The university is projecting 8% to 10% overall cost increases across the system for this fiscal year. That means health coverage for 3,442 employees is estimated to cost $85.5 million.     

A screenshot from a University of Alaska presentation on health care costs on Nov. 6, 2025, shows a rise in costs in recent years.
 

“​​We are seeing trend increases of 8% for medical, 13% for pharmacy and 4% for dental. We’ll do another recast in January of 2026 and hopefully try to firm up that figure and what that’s going to look like,” Conley said. 
Nationally, employers are expecting an 8.5% increase in medical costs and an 11% increase in pharmacy costs, she said, so the university’s costs and projections are mirroring that trend. 
Health care costs in Alaska are among the highest in the nation, according to state data. Since 2023, the average cost of a health insurance marketplace plan in Alaska rose by more than 16% each year. In 2023 alone, the cost went up by an average of 18.4%.
The university has a cost split for health care with 18% paid by employees in premiums, and 82% paid by the universities. Conley presented total cost projections to the board. 
Conley said the number of university employees isn’t growing, but more people are opting into the university’s health care plan. She said system-wide the largest cost increase is in pharmacy claims, but her department is expecting to renegotiate pharmacy costs, which could save the university about $3 million. 
Last year, the university saw pharmacy spending increase 11.2% from the year before. Over the last five years, overall pharmacy costs more than doubled from $9.2 million to $19.2 million, she said.
Conley said that’s partly due to a rise in prescriptions for drugs used for weight loss and to treat diabetes, known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic. They were the second highest pharmacy claim within the university’s plan, totaling $4.1 million last fiscal year.
“We’re also looking at the potential elimination of GLP-1s, because they are a major cost driver for us,” she added.
University of Alaska Regent Karen Perdue pushed back against that idea, pointing out that weight loss can also improve employees’ health outcomes and result in less health care costs. “It’s not just a plus, there can be a minus on the bottom line as well,” she said.     

A screenshot from a University of Alaska presentation on health care costs on Nov. 6, 2025 shows the highest claims for medical and pharmacy care
 

University of Alaska President Pat Pitney also pointed out other high pharmacy costs last year. The largest costs were on inflammatory diseases, with the highest cost at $4.3 million, and cancer treatments at $1.3 million.
The highest medical costs for the university last fiscal year were for muscle, joint and bone claims at $10.7 million, followed by cancer at $7 million, and behavioral health and disorder treatments at $5.3 million.
Last year, the university’s total costs came in at $80.1 million, which was $1.1 million over the university’s projection. Conley said next year’s premiums will go up to recover those costs. 
Conley said her department is working to push more education and use of wellness programs and preventative health care.
“Not only are we seeing this growth of 8% to 10% in cost, but we’re also seeing less use, for some reason, of our preventative health care. And so we’re really trying to encourage folks to use preventative health care, because that will help minimize some of our costs in the future,” she said. 
According to university data presented by Conley, only half of health care participants used preventative screenings, like annual physical exams or checkups; nearly 38% of emergency room visits could have been avoided with better primary care or urgent care use; and 38% of participants are categorized as pre-obese or obese. 
The university is insured through Premera Blue Cross, and Conley said her department discusses health care plan changes with the university’s Joint Health Care Committee, an advisory committee made up of representatives from the faculty union, management and staff. 
The university is also expecting a health care rebate, which is a benefit paid back to employees if they utilize the prevention programs throughout the year, like cancer screenings, dental care, and regular check ups. 
“We’re estimating about a $1.5 million rebate,” Conley said, for this year, ending in July 2026. “We’re going to see up to a $2.5 million rebate increase in FY27 with new rates. So that’s a good positive.”
The debate around national health care, federal tax credits, and costs for Americans has been at the heart of bitter negotiations around ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. This week, the U.S Congress approved a stopgap spending bill ending the shutdown. Democrats have introduced a discharge petition to force a vote to extend tax credits for three years under the Affordable Care Act. White the Senate Majority leader has promised a vote by the end of the year, leaders of the Republican-majority House have remained opposed, and discussions on health care are ongoing.

Kim Reynolds and Iowa State University President Wendy Wintersteen celebrated the expansion of bioindustrial manufacturing in Iowa as they joined executives of BioMADE at the ISU BioCentury Research Farm Friday for a groundbreaking ceremony.
The event celebrated the kickoff of the $40 million project to bring BioMADE, a Manufacturing Innovation Institute backed by the U.S. Department of War, to the ISU facility. The Iowa facility was funded using $10 million from the Iowa Economic Development Authority, $10 million from ISU and $20 million from BioMADE, in addition to receiving support from the U.S. Department of War.
The site, which measures 15,000 square feet, will be a pilot-scale biomanufacturing plant in Boone, designed to support the development and research of bioindustrial products to bring them to commercial and defense markets. The project includes plans to expand the ISU’s fermentation facilities, with 5,000 and 10,000-liter industrial fermenters, as well as lab space and downstream processing capabilities, for businesses to use to test products before deciding whether to move ahead with investing in their own manufacturing facilities for a product.
Reynolds said that nearly a year prior to the event ISU and BioMADE leaders visited her office to showcase their vision for the project.
“It was a bold, practical plan to bring together Iowa’s strengths in agriculture, research and manufacturing to build something truly transformative — and what an incredible moment it is to see all of that take shape today,” Reynolds said. “Today’s milestone is a reflection of the power of partnerships and the potential that it creates when government, industry and academia work side by side.”
Reynolds said Iowa and ISU in particular are a great fit for the project, as the university is already a leader on biomanufacturing, production and research, saying “the type of expertise and infrastructure that’s needed already exists” for BioMADE’s goals at the ISU BioCentury Research Farm.
“This new pilot (and) scaled-up facility helps complete Iowa’s biomanufacturing ecosystem,” Reynolds said. “It will take the discoveries from the lab and scale them into real world applications, accelerating American research and development, creating great new jobs and ensuring that breakthroughs developed in this country are made in this country.”
BioMADE CEO Douglas Friedman said that alongside the Iowa facility, the organization has also launched similar pilot projects in California and Minnesota with different production capacities and equipment, filling “a critical gap” in pilot and demonstration infrastructure, allowing for businesses to experiment with different products and materials throughout the country.
Wintersteen said much of the work already being done by researchers and faculty at the ISU facility is already focused on “identifying and fulfilling the critical gaps” in bringing products to market in bioindustrial fields, and that there will be opportunities for collaboration between the university and BioMADE.
“It will also serve as a hub for hands-on training and workforce development, preparing the next generation of bio-processing engineers and scientists,” Wintersteen said. “So we’re excited about what’s going to happen here, and the faculty that will be working here, and their efforts and efforts of many others that will produce key breakthroughs in bio-manufacturing.”
Friedman also said these pilot projects are crucial for “leading the way to more bio-based products being manufactured right here in America.” In Iowa, there will be a specific focus on food-grade capabilities — “ingredients like prebiotics, probiotics, sweeteners, flavors,” he said.
“We’ll be able to tie into the robust biomanufacturing ecosystem that is already present here in Iowa,” Friedman said.
Friedman also praised state government and ISU leaders for allowing the project to move forward quickly, “at a speed that makes sense in this era of global competition.” The facility is scheduled to open in 2027.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/biomade2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

Jeff Landry has established a new government efficiency task force to look at ways to cut state government spending.  (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)A task force Gov. Jeff Landry assembled is recommending that Louisiana’s colleges and universities join six other university systems from Southern states in a new conservative accrediting body. 
The governor’s Task Force on Public Higher Education Reform voted Thursday to request the Board of Regents, which oversees higher education in the state, ask for state money to pursue membership and a board seat on the Commission for Public Higher Education
The alternative accreditor is being formed by state university systems in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Accreditors are necessary to ensure schools meet minimum educational standards. 
The task force did not provide public notice of its meeting, which is a violation of the state’s Open Meetings Law. The statute requires all public bodies to take basic steps to ensure the public’s right to observe government proceedings. The Illuminator, which had requested notice to be sent, only learned of the meeting after it occurred when an attendee shared a copy of its recommendations. 
Louisiana’s move to change accreditors comes as conservatives have sparred with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, which evaluates colleges and universities in Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. 
Conservative politicians have taken issue with traditional accreditors at times because of their standards related to diversity, equity and inclusion. They also require safeguards that are intended to limit the influence of external forces, including politicians, in public higher education. 
The Southern Association does not require any DEI measures on its members’ campuses.
The Commission for Public Higher Education is seeking expedited recognition from the U.S. Department of Education, which is required for any school it approves to receive federal financial aid. 
The task force also recommended state legislation that would allow colleges and universities in Louisiana to be accredited by any group with the U.S. Department of Education’s recognition. The governor’s panel also recommended the removal of all references to the Southern Association from state law and higher education policy. 
Landry’s task force is also seeking legislation to prohibit any accreditor from having required standards that would violate state law. Legislators have previously filed legislation that conflicts with accrediting standards, but typically scale back or pull the bills once they are made aware they could risk universities’ accreditation status. 
In 2024, a bill that would have given the governor the power to directly hire university system presidents was significantly rolled back after good governance groups voiced concerns it would risk violating standards that prohibit undue external influence on universities. 
Task force members also recommended legislation to require schools post on their websites any documentation they submit to their accreditors to gain or maintain approval. 
Every member of the task force has been directly appointed to their job by Landry or his conservative allies except two: Commissioner of Higher Education Kim Hunter Reed and Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, who served as chairman. 
Besides Reed and Brumley, the other members are: 

 Misti Cordell, Board of Regents chairwoman
 Mark Romero, University of Louisiana System board chairman
 Scott Ballard, LSU System board chairman
 Tony Clayton, Southern University System board chairman
 Tim Hardy, Louisiana Community and Technical College System chairman 
 Sen. Rick Edmonds, R-Central, Senate Education Committee chairman
 Rep. Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie, House Education Committee chairwoman 
 Wade Rousse, incoming LSU System president
Angelique Freel, Landry’s executive counsel

The number of people the Trinity food shelf serves in Windsor has grown by about a third over the last couple of months, according to Nan Pariseau, a church member who also serves as operations director.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Nov. 13, 2025.
WINDSOR — The federal shutdown ended late Wednesday night with a bill that extends the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP benefits, through the end of next September.
Even in spite of the restoration of these benefits, however, those who use SNAP and those who work to address food insecurity in the Upper Valley remain concerned about the program’s future.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Maria Rogers, who, to supplement her SNAP benefits, uses and volunteers at the food pantry at Trinity Free Evangelical Church in downtown Windsor. “Not just a little. A lot.”
Rogers and others interviewed this week before the shutdown ended said that their concerns would persist even after the shutdown ended.
When the shutdown started on Oct. 1, the federal government paused SNAP payments for Rogers and millions of others who receive the monthly benefit. States tried to make up the difference, but the uncertainty and lack of payments led to growing food insecurity for residents.
Each month, when Rogers, a 65-year-old Windsor resident, gets $166 from SNAP, she starts looking at what area grocery stores have on sale. Then, she asks herself a question: “Is the gas worth it?”
Brenda Egbert, of Fairlee, supplements her grocery shopping with produce and other items from the food pantry at at the Orford Congregational Church, which is run by the organization Orford Cares and the Orford, N.H., Democratic Committee on Tuesday, Nov. 11. This year an average of more than 40 people each week visit the pantry to pick up non-perishable food donated by community members or purchased with donated funds, and produce provided by Willing Hands. “It definitely makes a dent in the grocery bill,” said Egbert. Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley News
This month that math was harder to do because of the delay in SNAP benefits. Rogers received half — $83 — from the state of Vermont on Nov. 7, but she had yet to receive the remainder. (A Vermont official told lawmakers on Thursday that a full month’s benefits were set to go to recipients on Friday via Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, though the process could take until Monday for direct deposit into bank accounts.)
Rogers and her husband are both disabled. She has also volunteered and cooked meals for Upper Valley food pantries for close to 40 years.
“Oh no,” Rogers, of Windsor, said when asked if the money covers her monthly grocery bills. “Especially if you get meat, that barely covers for a month.”
The number of families the Trinity food shelf serves in Windsor has grown by about a third over the last couple of months, said Nan Pariseau, a church member who also serves as operations director for the food shelf.
“We’ve been expecting it,” Pariseau, 56, of Claremont, said during an interview at the food pantry. “We’ve been preparing for it.”
Fall and the upcoming holiday season are typically busy for food pantries. The colder temperatures and shorter days mean fuel and electricity costs rise. Children are home from school for vacations and families are trying to create special holiday memories. Even with SNAP benefits fully restored, those other stressors do not go away, Pariseau said. “It’s a storm brewing,” she said.
The Trinity food pantry is averaging 52 families per week. Usually the number is around 34 families per week, with more showing up toward the end of the month as SNAP benefits run low. Many of the new patrons are older adults with one- or two-person households and families with more than five people. “Those are the ones that are really struggling,” Pariseau said.
The Trinity food pantry spends around $2,500 a month on food and is projected to spend about 15% more than that this month, Pariseau said.
Fresh produce provided through Willing Hands is available at the Trinity Evangelical Free Church food pantry in Windsor on Wednesday, Nov. 12. Volunteer Maria Rogers, of Windsor, said the food assistance need in the community has increased substantially. “We’ve gotten a bunch of new people we haven’t seen before,” she said. Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News
She has been applying for more grants, in addition to working with other community groups and food pantries. She and food pantry volunteers are also working to spread the word that Trinity’s doors are open for anyone in need. “The biggest barrier we have is shame,” Pariseau said. She noted that she used SNAP herself years ago while she was raising three children and going through a divorce.
Shame shouldn’t be a barrier, said Shawn Dennett, a Windsor resident and single father of two children, ages 11 and 9, who volunteers at the Trinity food pantry. He uses SNAP to help feed his children. “How am I going to do this?” was his first thought Dennett, 38, said when the shutdown started. “I told my kids that whatever is in the apartment, you guys have at it.”
When his children asked him what he would do, he said he’d manage. He and his family got $287 in SNAP benefits on Nov. 7, half of their usual allotment, and are making it work, including by using the food pantry.
“It’s scary,” he said about the uncertainty surrounding SNAP. “After this shutdown … even if it does get lifted, going forward, what’s going to happen?”
Dennett works as a landscaper during the warmer months, but the jobs dry up as it gets colder. He also wants to be able to spend time with his children, including being home when they get home from school and to cook dinner for them every night.
Pasta dishes are a hit and his 11-year-old son is a fan of T-bone steak. Some nights, when he’s too tired to cook or had a rough day at work, the kids get microwavable Chef Boyardee ravioli cups as a treat. Meat takes up the biggest share of the budget, Dennett said, and he’s noticed costs are rising. He noted that eggs and dairy products have also gone up in price.
“SNAP is out there to help families,” he said.
Food pantries are too. Dennett is a member of Trinity Evangelical Free Church. “I was a little wary at first” to use the food pantry, but thinks differently now. “Nobody needs to go hungry,” he said.

Many patrons are older and some struggle to prepare meals for themselves. Others are working multiple jobs while caring for family members and don’t have the time.
“A lot of people want prepared food,” Rogers said. She cooks using items donated or purchased by the food pantry. Beef Stroganoff, spaghetti with sauce, macaroni and cheese and salmon pea wiggle are among the more popular dishes. The food shelf prepares meals that are portioned out that people can then take home to heat up later.
Patrons who liked a dish often ask for the recipe. Sometimes, Rogers will teach them how to cook it in Trinity’s kitchen.
Each year, the food pantry puts together 65 Thanksgiving baskets — filled with all the fixings for a Thanksgiving meal — and as of Wednesday had 91 families signed up, with the Nov. 14 deadline a few days away. Panty staff are currently working on figuring out how to get turkeys, which cost around $15 each, for each of the baskets.
“We are digging deep,” Pariseau said.

Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley News
The community is as well. The food pantry has seen an influx in donations. There are some products that are harder to come by and more expensive that patrons need, including gluten-free items. Many of the older patrons are coping with health challenges and need low-sodium and sugar-free options. There’s also a need for canned fruit and cooking oils.
“They really need more fruits and vegetables in their lives but if they can’t afford it, they should come here and get it,” said Ginny Barr, 75, of Reading, a longtime food pantry volunteer. She noted that there are no barriers to getting help: the food pantry does not ask patrons for income information or other proof that they’re in need.
“They’re here for a reason,” Barr said at the food pantry. “They’ve got their reasons. We don’t have [to] know their reasons. We just serve them.”
Even before the shutdown, other Upper Valley food pantries were experiencing similar increases: In the last year, the Upper Valley Haven has seen a 20% increase in patrons, said Jennifer Fontaine, director of operations at the White River Junction-based nonprofit organization. “In October 2025 alone, there were 2,099 visits — a 16% increase over September’s numbers, continuing a steady rise that began in August,” she wrote in an email.
The Haven saw 108 new households in October and another 103 households who hadn’t stopped by in more than a year — “[c]lear signs that many neighbors are still struggling with high costs and ongoing financial strain,” Fontaine wrote.
To meet patrons increased needs, the Haven ran a fundraising campaign. Food donations are still needed, including items such as cooking oils, spices, baking supplies, shelf-stable milk and jams or jellies. “Many individuals and groups have reached out to host food drives or volunteer, and we hope that enthusiasm continues even when the government reopens and SNAP benefits resume,” Fontaine wrote. “With food and consumer costs remaining high, the need for assistance will still be there.”

(Photo via Providence Warwick CVB)A proposed $300-per-tenant annual fee for landlords who provide student-only housing drew strong reactions during a public hearing before a Providence City Council committee Thursday night, mostly from opponents.
In June 2025, Councilors Shelley Peterson and John Goncalves introduced the proposal to amend the city’s housing laws and allow for the fee for owners of off-campus buildings rented solely to college students. Noncompliant landlords could face fines of up to $500 a day. The ordinance would require the city’s colleges and universities to supply lists of students living off campus. 
There was no vote at Thursday’s meeting of the Committee on Ordinances, which was held expressly for committee members to hear residents’ thoughts on the proposed “student impact fee.” In her opening remarks, Peterson acknowledged her proposal was controversial, adding that disagreement is an ingredient in the democratic process. 
“What we’re discussing tonight isn’t about politics or personalities,” Peterson said. “It’s about whether we believe that everyone who benefits from our city should also share in the responsibility of taking care of it.” 
Peterson — who presides over Ward 14, home to Providence College (PC) and dense with off-campus housing —  then went on to “dispel a very immediate rumor” that the fee is “about punishing students.” 
“It’s about holding accountable the landlords and developers who profit most from student housing while contributing the least to the neighborhoods that they reshape,” Peterson said, and cited the example of Ward 14, where the city has had to install more than 200 new parking signs, clear drains, and “respond to more police and sanitation calls [near student housing] than any other part of the ward.”
The council’s ordinances committee first took up the issue at its July 17 meeting, and planned for a future public hearing. Before Thursday’s meeting, Goncalves removed himself as a sponsor. Goncalves did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
Peterson told the students who turned out to testify in opposition that they’re being misled by landlords. A handout at the meeting also sought to counter the claims made by landlords about the ordinance.      
“Contrary to everything that they’ve told you, the city does value you,” Peterson said. “You are part of the fabric of Providence. You do support our businesses. You do volunteer your time, and you do bring life to our streets.” 
“You’re not the problem,” Peterson continued. “The problem is an unchecked housing system that treats you as a product and your neighborhood as a profit margin.”
There’s much profit to be made off students living off Providence’s many campuses, which include Brown University, Providence College, Rhode Island College, Rhode Island School of Design and Johnson & Wales University.
But most of the 150 pages of written testimony the council received leaned heavily against the measure, with 135 pages of opposition to 15 pages of support. A good chunk of the opposition letters were names from a petition.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley submitted a letter in opposition to the ordinance as drafted, citing “serious operational and enforcement concerns.” Forcing colleges to share information on students’ addresses might conflict with federal privacy laws, Smiley suggested, and matching anonymized student data to specific properties could prove tricky and time-consuming.

Broke college students
The proposal is another chapter in what’s been a woeful year for the finances of Rhode Island’s capital city. A November 2024 settlement with the state education department forced city officials to come up with $11 million, leading the city to ask for the General Assembly’s permission to increase its overall tax levy. The successful maneuver nevertheless offered a rare moment at the State House where landlords and tenants decried the effect the legislation would have on property taxes, which had skyrocketed in the latest cycle of property reevaluations.   
The levy increased 5.85% for fiscal year 2026 only, but the increases fell upon homeowners in unequal ways. Non-owner occupied, multifamily homes with two to five units — the kinds of housing inhabited by college students — were subject to an average 13% increase in property taxes for fiscal year 2026.
That trickles down, argued Kevin Keaveney, a Providence College senior studying finance and business management. He told the committee Thursday that students “are genuinely worried about the financial strain this proposed plan would place on them.” 
“The stereotype that college students are broke exists for a reason,” Keaveney said. 
Peterson actually voted against final passage of the fiscal year 2026 budget in July, one of only two councilors to do so. The additional student fee money would not go into general revenue or municipal services, however. Instead, Peterson said the fees would be directed to the city’s new home repair program, which she said “helps our low-income homeowners fix code violations by making repairs and staying in their homes in a city where the median household income is $66,000.”
“The money collected here won’t go to the general fund,” Peterson said. “It’s not going to get lost in red tape.”
Peterson said the ordinance targets landlords, not students, and she cited the largest off-campus landlord in Ward 14’s Elmhurst neighborhood who provides housing for roughly 1,200 students, pulling in an estimated $7 million a year in rent. Add in fees — “There’s added fees for pretty much everything that you guys have, right?” Peterson said — and the landlord could rake in $660,000 monthly in fees alone, in the councilor’s estimate. 
That business model incensed Peterson and Councilor Justin Roias, a co-sponsor who strongly defended the ordinance. Toward the end of the meeting, Roias observed Keaveney said his rent was $1,290 a month in an eight-person house. Roias did some rough math and argued that a triple decker could pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in rent income.
“I would argue that the student housing developers in Ward 14 specifically have had a monopolizing effect on the neighborhood,” Roias said. “They’ve actually set the market…I look at this ordinance as one of very few tools that we even have as a city to discourage student developers from continuing this business model.”
The ordinance, Roias said, is not against “mixed” housing, with “a student on the first floor and a family on the second floor,” he said. “This is exclusively student housing that this ordinance targets.”
‘It’s economics 101’
Perhaps most targeted by councilors’ ire were companies like the 02908 Club, a student rental business near Providence College in Ward 14. The Club had recently sent out multiple emails regarding the hearing and public comment period to students. While Peterson did not name the company in her opening remarks, her handout did, and she called the email blasts “a waste of time.”  
Shannon Russell, who sent those emails as part of her job as operations manager for the 02908 Club, disagreed.
“It’s my company that’s being attacked and lied about here tonight, just to put that out there,” Russell said in her turn at the podium.










I would argue that the student housing developers in Ward 14 specifically have had a monopolizing effect on the neighborhood.


– Providence City Councilor Justin Roias


She said the fees could absolutely be passed onto students. Distributors’ costs are passed onto sellers who pass those increased costs onto customers, she said. 
“It’s economics 101,” Russell said. “It’s simple. It’s basic.”
But ordinance supporter Joanne Rich argued the $300 fee was modest compared to the rents being charged.
Rich said the situation near Providence College — such as a highly publicized incident on Halloween night, which Russell and the college claimed did not involve PC students— was evidence that Ward 14 “has already been converted to an unruly, unmonitored extension of the PC campus.” 
Rich then apologized for being “a little snarky” but pressed ahead anyway. She said that if landlords pass along the fees, “I would suggest that the students impacted spend $8 less a week on alcohol, which might go a little way toward lessening the nuisance towards their neighbors as well.”
A date for a committee vote has not been set as of Friday.
“Having the public hearing was really the only planned next step,” City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said in an email Friday. “The sponsor will now consider the feedback from the community, decide on any amendments, and then she would request from the chair that it be scheduled for a vote.”

In a 13-page filing, the attorneys cited the presence of the parent of a CHOOSE Act parent in the lawsuit, which seeks to prevent AHSAA from enforcing transfer eligibility policies on students who go to private schools under the plan.
“The plaintiffs likewise acknowledge that the affected students can protect their own interests, which Jaclyn Hall is attempting to do by joining the lawsuit on behalf of her minor child Z.H.2,” the filing said.

The lawsuit, filed by Ivey and Ledbetter in September in Montgomery County Circuit Court, alleges that AHSAA is discriminating against CHOOSE Act athletes who transfer to another school by having them not participate in athletics for a year.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that allows families to claim up to $7,000 in tax credits for non-public education expenses including private school tuition. 
Student athletes that receive CHOOSE Act funds and transfer to another school are required to be ineligible for sports for one year.  AHSAA considers it financial aid that brings its transfer policies into play, which AHSAA said ensures fairness.
Attorneys for Ivey and Ledbetter filed a preliminary injunction to replace the temporary restraining order they were granted on Sept. 5 and also added an additional plaintiff to the lawsuit in September.
The court is scheduled to hold a hearing in the lawsuit on Nov. 21.
Attorneys for AHSAA also argued that neither Ivey or Ledbetter have been harmed in their roles as governor and speaker of the House.
“Gov. Ivey and Speaker Ledbetter do not identify actual, concrete and particularized injury in fact either has suffered personally in his or her official capacities,” the rebuttal said.
A message seeking comment was left with the AHSAA Friday. Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement Friday Ivey will continue to advocate for CHOOSE Act families affected by AHSAA’s regulations.
“Gov. Ivey’s mission is to simply let the kids play, and she refuses to stand by while the AHSAA unfairly and unlawfully discriminates against CHOOSE Act student-athletes,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nathaniel-Ledbetter-Kay-Ivey-Feb-12-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

He stayed at the Mercy Housing and Shelter Corporation and was eventually able to get a job and an apartment, which the organization subsidized. The shelter’s help is the “only reason” he is housed, safe, healthy and “living with dignity” today, he said, speaking at a press conference Friday.
But the Trump administration said late Thursday that it planned to cut federal funding for permanent housing programs like the one that helped Chris, who asked to be identified by only his first name.
In Connecticut, the policy change means long-term housing programs could lose as much as $69 million, risking the housing of 6,500 people, according to estimates from the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and the CT CAN End Homelessness campaign. 
A notice from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development posted Thursday announced changes to what’s known as the Continuum of Care program, which provides most federal homelessness relief funding. Having a disability is a condition to receive permanent housing through Continuum of Care.
According to the notice, the Trump administration plans to lower the cap on permanent housing spending from 90% to 30% of all homelessness relief funding. Instead, funding will flow to programs that provide temporary housing with work requirements, treatment mandates and other conditions.
At the Friday event, held by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, service providers spoke out against the policy, saying that permanent housing is the most effective, proven method for supporting unhoused people.
For decades, U.S. policy has been guided by a theory, known as “Housing First,” that permanent shelter is a necessary first step for people, who can then — from a more stable living situation — move on to finding health care and steady work. 
The Trump administration favors a different approach.
A U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in a press release Thursday, “The failed ‘Housing First’ ideology… encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.” The press release described the policy change as an effort to increase accountability for service providers by creating competition between them for grants. 
Louis Gill, CEO of housing aid nonprofit Columbus House, said it’s hard for people to improve their lives without first having permanent housing. “When you destabilize housing, you destabilize everything built upon it: medical care, mental health, sobriety, income, employment, community, and safety,” he said.
Gill added that the Trump administration’s policy change will force people who have already become self sufficient to start over, especially those with disabilities.
“These cuts ask providers to look disabled, medically fragile residents in the eye and tell them that the stability they built, the stability our government promised them through this program, may no longer be within reach,” he said.
Sarah Fox, CEO of the CT Coalition to End Homelessness, said it’s not so simple to rework longstanding programs to comply with the new rules. Providers are set up to supply permanent housing and most grants will now be awarded for temporary housing with strings attached, she said. “It is a big separation from our morals.”
What comes next
Critics of the new policy said they hope to stop it from going into effect — or find other funding.
Jennifer Paradis, executive director of the Beth-El Center shelter, said she believes the change is illegal. For one, she said, the policy directs funding to programs that help police clear homeless camps and mandate mental health or addiction treatment in exchange for housing. 
“Nothing in the law authorizes HUD to require criminalization or treatment compliance as a condition of funding,” Paradis said. She also argued it discriminates against disabled people.
Sen. Blumenthal said he expects there to be lawsuits against the policy. 
Blumenthal wants Congress to pass a budget appropriation of $4 billion that specifically requires permanent housing. “It’s on us,” he said.
Connecticut legislators said permanent housing could be funded with some of a $500 million emergency fund they approved on Thursday. Gov. Ned Lamont has discretion over how to use the money, though it’s intended generally to backfill federal funding losses for human services.
State Representative Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, said she wants to “ensure that that $500 million gets spent, and that some of it gets spent on this.”
But she said that the emergency fund isn’t enough to support permanent housing along with other programs that have lost funding. “Do we honestly believe that that will be enough when we are hearing just the numbers for this one issue?” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0266-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 17:57:28.412675

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Democratic lawmakers in each chamber of the Florida Legisature have re-introduced a bill that would establish a protocol allowing schools to search for students with autism who wander off.
The bills requires public schools to create plans and a cohort of personnel to address situations in which students with autism “elope,” or wander away from safe areas. 
“This long-overdue measure would finally bring Florida in line with states that have already taken action on this issue,” Sen. Kristen Arrington, a Democrat from Kissimmee, said in a news release. 
“By establishing clear, statewide guidelines, we can equip school districts with the tools and support they need to protect our most vulnerable children. It also gives parents confidence that, in an emergency, their child’s school will be prepared to respond quickly and effectively.”
The bill calls for creating school elopement plans involving immediately contacting the parent of the student, conducting “an immediate, coordinated on-campus search and contacting emergency services only when the student is reasonably believed, based on verified information or direct observation, to have left school grounds and to be at risk of harm.”
The School Staff Assistance for Emergencies teams would annually update the school elopement plan, respond to all elopements, and train school personnel on response. The bill would require a student-specific “quick reference guide” for students prone to eloping.

“As a society, we need to be more assertive in protecting the needs, safety, and dignity of the neurodiverse population. All special needs students in Florida deserve the same protection,” Monica Carretero said in the news release. Carretero is the mother of a child with autism who once was found at an outdoor basketball court after eloping from his classroom.
The identical bills, HB 423 and SB 494, were filed by Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat, and Arrington. 
Nearly half of children with autism attempt to elope from safe environments, according to the National Autism Association. Some of those children have accidentally drowned. 
“With nearly half of children with autism attempting to elope from safe environments, these safeguards are urgently needed,” Eskamani said in a news release. “Every student deserves to be safe at school, and every parent deserves peace of mind.”
Arrington filed the bill in the 2024 and 2025 sessions. Neither received a committee hearing. 
Eskamani filed the bill in 2023, 2024, and 2025. The 2023 and 2025 bills made it through one subcommittee but died, while her 2024 bill did not receive a hearing.
Lawmakers last session took a particular interest in addressing problems faced by Floridians with autism and their families.
During the 2025 session, the first bill to pass the Senate increases early detection opportunities and educational interventions for children with autism, a top priority for Senate President Ben Albritton, a Republican from Wauchula. That bill, SB 112, is now law.
That bill was among others last session that created a workforce credential for students with autism, and another relating to employers covering benefits for children with autism.

Purdue developed and patented the drug OxyContin in 1996. The prescription painkiller is an opioid, a class of drugs that can relieve pain but can also be highly addictive and debilitating. For years, company officials and the Sacklers, the family that owned the company, downplayed the risk of OxyContin, even as evidence mounted that its frequent prescriptions were leading to more overdose deaths across the country.
Although physicians prescribed fewer bottles of OxyContin and other opioid painkillers over the last decade, research indicates the legacy of Purdue’s marketing campaigns continues to jeopardize American lives. People addicted to prescription painkillers often switched to using illicit opioids, like heroin and fentanyl, when pills became less available. A 2023 Yale study found that states where the company’s marketing was less regulated continue to have higher rates of fentanyl overdoses and infections related to injection drug use, like hepatitis C.

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

The company has pleaded guilty for its marketing of OxyContin in the past, but it and the Sackler family have largely avoided the large national lawsuit payouts other companies have agreed to by filing for bankruptcy in 2019. A previous proposal would have required the family to pay up to $6 billion throughout the United States, but the Supreme Court rejected that settlement in June 2024 because of its civil lawsuit protections for the Sacklers. 
The new settlement, agreed to by state attorneys general in June, instructs the Sacklers to pay $7.4 billion to the states and doesn’t include the same legal shields for the Sacklers. Mississippi is set to receive its nearly $41 million share of that over the next 15 years. 
If finalized, Purdue’s payout brings Mississippi’s contributions from companies to around $421 million in reparations for their roles in the opioid epidemic — a public health catastrophe that has killed over 10,000 Mississippians. Health services in the state responded to close to 5,500 non-fatal overdoses just in the first seven months of 2025, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.
Purdue’s settlement is subject to similar rules as the previous opioid lawsuits — 70% must be used for future strategies to address addiction, and the remaining 30% can be used for any other public purpose. 
The Legislature and 147 Mississippi local governments will split that 30%, or $12.3 million. So far, few of those local governments’ leaders have chosen to use their money to address the crisis Purdue and the other companies contributed to. Those decisions and delays in the state portion of the opioid settlements have led to Mississippi having committed less lawsuit money to prevent overdoses than every other state in the country as of this summer — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares.
The 70%, or $28.7 million, that does need to be spent on addiction-related purposes will be overseen by Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council. The council has been meeting over the past few months, and state law says the council is required to recommend how the Legislature should spend the funds by Dec. 7 of this year.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07043334/AP_17227561183611.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

TerraGen, a renewable energy developer, opened the Monte Cristo I Windpower Project in Hidalgo County, Texas this week. The facility has a 238.5-megawatt capacity — equivalent to powering 81,000 homes a year. And, 78.5 of those megawatts are committed to the copper mine outside Salt Lake City. 
The agreement strengthens the company’s renewable energy portfolio in the country, Rio Tinto Kennecott managing director Nate Foster said in a statement.

“It’s the latest in a series of renewable energy projects for Kennecott, following the installation of a 5MW solar plant in 2023, and a second 25MW solar plant nearing completion,” Foster wrote. “We continue to look for ways to power our operations while also lowering our emissions to help achieve Rio Tinto’s long-term decarbonisation goals.”
Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon mine has been in operation for over 120 years and currently is ready to remain active until 2026. Up until recently, there were plans in place to extend mining until 2032, but the company is also preparing feasibility studies to prolong the mine’s life until 2040.

The agreement also follows a switch to renewable diesel to power haul trucks and other heavy machinery equipment at the open-pit mine. In the past, the company also made efforts to reduce emissions, including the full closure of its coal-powered energy plant in 2019 in favor of solar and wind power sources. 
“Around 78% of the electricity Rio Tinto uses globally comes from renewable sources, and the company is making investment and supply decisions to increase this to around 90% by 2030,” Rio Tinto said in a news release.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)For Hannah DeLange, the most rewarding part of managing Redhead Hemp’s Durham location has been “creating a space for people to feel comfortable and confident” — crafting an inviting social setting much like a coffee shop or bar.
The shelves are lined with CBD gummies, Delta-9 sangrias, and THC caramels, among a host of other drinks and candies with promises like “sleep with benefits” and “lower calories, higher vibes.”
The shop interior has a cozy feel, with plants lining brick walls flush with brightly colored artwork, and plush sofas and chairs to relax on. At the store’s “Canna Cafe,” customers can sit down with hemp-infused teas and coffee.
“It’s just kind of a space for all,” DeLange said. “It should be a plant for all the people, and it should be accessible — and just creating a space that’s able to really just personify that.”
Now, the future of that space and many others like it are in doubt, with the vast majority of their hemp-based cannabinoid products set to become illegal in November 2026.
North Carolina hemp business owners and their counterparts across the U.S. are bracing for the ban’s impact, with some pursuing advocacy efforts to reverse the ban and others working to pivot to the narrow slice of CBD products that will remain legal.

‘I think there’s a lot of fearmongering’
“We found out the morning of the Senate vote that this was occurring,” said Emma MacAdam, the owner of Redhead Hemp. “It was pretty clear when they slipped it in the bill that that bill was going to pass, so it kind of felt like a really sleazy way for them to just slide their agenda into a bill that was very necessary and important for so many people.”

Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, differentiated mainly by the levels of the psychoactive compound THC, with hemp having far less of it. CBD, another chemical produced by the cannabis plant, does not have intoxicating effects by itself but produces a calming effect and has been shown to help treat pain and anxiety.
The ban, which sharply decreases the allowable level of THC in hemp products, passed earlier this week as part of an Agriculture appropriations bill that was paired with the stopgap funding agreement to end the federal government shutdown.
It bars the sale of any hemp product, including CBD products, containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container, which DeLange and MacAdam said represents about 99.5% of their stock. This would eliminate “full spectrum” hemp products, which they said make up most typical CBD products.
“Basically, they’re saying we can only use the parts of the plant that are not intoxicating,” DeLange said. “For a lot of people, the THC compound — even that small amount that you see in full spectrum — is what’s really important for pain relief, anxiety, sleep, things like that.”
DeLange said that using CBD products has also helped some customers stop using opioids or drinking heavily. “The drinks have been a really great resource for a lot of people who want to have a healthier alternative for that.”
The ban comes after years of lobbying by the marijuana industry and state law enforcement, who argued the hemp industry exploited a loophole to sell products with many of the same effects of marijuana but none of the regulatory oversight. Senators say they never intended to open a recreational hemp market and only desired to enable industrial hemp farming.
The rationale, according to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other backers of the Agriculture bill is to “keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers” by closing the loophole that allows the sale of CBD products with less than 0.3% THC, the threshold originally set by the 2018 Farm Bill he helped pass.

“Unfortunately, companies have exploited a loophole in the 2018 legislation by taking legal amounts of THC from hemp and turning it into intoxicating substances, and then marketing it to children in candy-like packaging and selling it in easily accessible places, like gas stations and convenience stores all across our country,” McConnell said Monday.
MacAdam and DeLange pushed back on the claim that the products target young customers. They said their shop has a strict over-21 policy.
“It’s very easy to use the ‘save the children’ flagship banner for a lot of things, I think there’s a lot of fearmongering surrounding cannabis — that’s the history of cannabis, period,” DeLange said.
“And absolutely no talk of parent responsibility in that matter, also no talk of how liquor is not childproof, and a lot of new liquor companies are just as cute and colorful,” MacAdam added. “I think it’s a complete cop-out.”
‘The wild west’
The rapid shift to prohibition represents a marked change for an industry that has had little to no regulation for the past seven years in many states, including North Carolina.
North Carolina, has failed to enact any regulations on intoxicating hemp products, even basic age restrictions, despite bipartisan backing from the state Senate, Gov. Josh Stein and Attorney General Jeff Jackson.
In February, the state’s child care task force reported a 600% increase in emergency room visits for minors related to cannabis use since 2019. Stein launched an advisory council on cannabis products in June, urging that “our state’s unregulated cannabis market is the wild west and is crying out for order.”

Last month, Jackson joined 38 states’ attorneys general to call for regulation from Congress on the sale of CBD products, asking lawmakers to “clarify the federal definition of hemp” during the appropriations process.
“State efforts to outlaw hemp-derived psychoactive products to protect their citizens cannot solve this problem,” the letter from the attorneys general read. “Such efforts can only lead to an uneven and ineffectual patchwork of bans and regulations that differ from State to State and will not stop the flood of mail-order THC products from streaming through interstate commerce.”
Bills proposed in North Carolina this year that failed to advance include bans on selling to minors and sales permit requirements as well as childproof packaging and printed warnings. A bill that passed the Senate in June, which Jackson spoke in support of, would forbid sales of hemp-derived drinks, gummies, and other products to anyone under 21 and ban their use on school grounds, among other regulations like a licensing process.
That bill and many others died in the powerful House Rules Committee, now chaired by Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne), who became the president of hemp company Asterra Labs in 2024. Bell did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
MacAdam said the lack of regulation has been a benefit in some ways, such as making the industry more accessible to those with relatively few resources, creating greater opportunity for nontraditional business owners.
“It’s really cool to see what an industry can do when there’s no barrier to entry. There’s no license you need to pay $100,000 for. I started this business with a tiny bit of money and a big goal, and I’m very grateful for all the people that we’ve met along the way,” she said.
‘That’s part of our livelihood’
Also left in the lurch are farm owners who grow floral, or smokable, hemp — the crop grown to make CBD products. Dana Rider, co-owner of Otherside Farm in rural Buncombe County, said the industry had become “kind of jaded” by close calls on potential bans since the legalization of hemp products in 2018.
“We’d be freaking out and then everything would be okay, or they would postpone it for another year,” Rider said. “Obviously, [the ban is] going to strike a chord somewhere, because, you know, that’s part of our livelihood.”
He said his family started growing hemp a year after starting their farm. Other farmers he knows switched to hemp to revitalize old tobacco farms and dairies that had fallen into disrepair. They now operate an online shop, Otherside Hemp, and also sell their products in stores around the state. “It’s part of our income and helps keep the farm afloat,” he said.
He said for many customers, the goal isn’t to experience a chemical high but instead to manage pain and other conditions like insomnia and anxiety.

“Your grandmother and your great aunt and your parents, they don’t want to feel different, they don’t want to have this altered consciousness,” Rider said. “They just want to feel better.”
MacAdam and Rider both say they have been in conversation with other business owners working to push back against the ban in the year before it takes effect.
“We carry a lot of small businesses, a lot of family-run businesses, so we’re really worried about our friends,” MacAdam said.
Otherside Farm plans to urge its supporters to contact their state and local representatives about the ban, Rider said. “We have a year to either figure it out or we have a year to just like, crush it and fight for the plant and hope that we can change this with legislation.”
“We’re going to kind of wait it out,” he added. “Until they tell us that we can’t sell our stuff anymore, we’re going to keep selling our stuff and growing and producing our products.”
While some farms and shops will be able to continue to legally sell products processed to remove any THC, also known as “CBD isolates,” Rider said his farm lacks the equipment to produce them. Because they sell full-spectrum products only, their entire array of products would be wiped out by the ban.
“For us, we can’t really pivot, right?” Rider said. “We would not be around anymore, basically, which is sad to think about.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Redhead-Hemp-Product-Rack-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

(Canva image)The Louisiana Department of Health wants caretakers to stop using ByHeart baby formula, which federal officials say might be contaminated with a bacteria that can make children sick. 

Anyone who’s purchased ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula should throw it away immediately or return it to the store where it was purchased, state health officials said in a news release Friday. 

At least 23 infants in 13 states have been sickened with infant botulism traced to ByHeart formula since August. There have been no deaths attributed to the outbreak, and none of the cases were in Louisiana. 
ByHeart Inc. started a recall of its powdered formula earlier this week. Two couples whose babies have developed the infection have also filed lawsuits against ByHeart in Arizona and Kentucky, according to the Associated Press. 
Louisiana officials advise families who have purchased ByHeart to take a photo or write down the product’s lot number, found on the bottom of the can, before disposing of it. Containers and surfaces the formula might have touched should also be washed with hot soapy water, they said. 

Babies who have injuested the bacteria might not get sick for days or weeks. They should be monitored for 30 days after their last exposure to the formula for signs of illness. There is no testing that can be done to see if a baby has ingested the bacteria unless symptoms surface. 
Signs of infant botulism include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing, decreased facial expression, a weak or altered cry and muscle weakness. Babies who develop these behaviors should be seen by a medical professional immediately, according to the state health department. 

The Louisiana health department is working with retail businesses and others to ensure ByHeart formula is taken off shelves in stores. ByHeart only makes up 1% of the baby formula market nationwide, so federal officials do not expect its recall to trigger a larger shortage of infant formula.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/infant-formula6-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A political fight among Republicans in Ravalli County that resulted in the ousting of Freedom Caucus allies from local leadership posts earlier this year may serve as a warning to the Montana Republican Party.
In March 2025, Ravalli County District Court Judge Jennifer Lint found the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee had disenfranchised voters and infringed on their constitutional rights by failing to hold an election of officers.
In the complaint, Stevensville Republican Tony Hudson alleged the local party chairman, influenced by hardline members of the GOP, was failing to hold a central committee election contrary to state law, and was illegally holding onto power.
Defendant Ron Stoltz, then chairman of the Ravalli County central committee, argued state GOP bylaws, amended in June 2024, precluded a local election until after Dec. 1, 2026, and he said he had held off at the direction of the state GOP.
But the judge said that stance ran contrary to state law.
Without a local election, precinct captains elected in June 2024 wouldn’t have the chance to run for leadership or select officers or delegates to the state convention, and the judge ordered Stoltz to hold one.
The results ushered in new leadership on the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee, and some Republicans say the case helped end a caustic period within the local GOP, one pushed by  power-hungry members of the Freedom Caucus.
But shrapnel from the case could still hit the Montana Republican Party.
Hudson, who filed the lawsuit, and his lawyer, Joan Mell, said the case could open the door to legal action that challenges election outcomes from the June 2025 state GOP convention — an organization that itself trumpets concerns about election integrity.
The case also raises questions about how the Montana GOP will move forward.
In a July email and memo obtained by the Daily Montanan, Montana GOP Chairman Art Wittich told central committees to hold off on local conventions and officer elections until December 2026, as the state GOP advised the Ravalli County chairman prior to the lawsuit.
Through a spokesperson, Wittich declined an interview for this story.
Hudson, though, said the state GOP has misled “good Republicans,” it has let bullies from the Freedom Caucus run roughshod over the organization, and it needs a similar restoration of order for which he fought in Ravalli County.
“We need to follow the law in the Republican Party,” Hudson said. “If we are going to be the party of law and order, then we must.”
 Takeover, fighting in Ravalli County Republican Central Committee

The Covid-19 pandemic ratcheted up anti-government sentiment among some members of the hard right in the Bitterroot Valley, deepening political divisions and opening the door to new leadership on the central committee.
Terry Nelson, selected this year to replace a resigning state legislator, had served as chairperson of the central committee for more than a decade.
In 2023, state Sen. Theresa Manzella, a Hamilton Republican and flashy hardliner, successfully nominated Stoltz as chairperson of the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee.
The 2023 central committee election put control of the executive board in the hands of the more extreme members of the Republican Party.
Hudson, on the Stevensville Public Schools board, said under the influence of Manzella and other activist hardliners, local GOP leadership ostracized Republicans who didn’t fall in line.
Manzella declined an interview and did not answer written questions in time for this story. 










We need to follow the law in the Republican Party. If we are going to be the party of law and order, then we must.


– Tony Hudson


At central committee meetings, Hudson said Stoltz would cut off public comment if he didn’t agree with the speaker.
“It was their beliefs 100% or nothing,” Hudson said. “There was no dialogue. There was no communication.”
Patty Franklin, current vice chairperson of the central committee, said local GOP leaders took actions that were out of step with party tradition, such as spending money on primary races.
But Franklin said when members who weren’t in lockstep with leadership tried to raise a collective voice and reason with elected officers, they were met with animosity.
“This group was very hostile,” Franklin said.
 Hudson mobilizes new members, ‘Dirty Thirty’ accusation flies

Hudson decided he had seen enough of the central committee leadership and its influencers.
In 2024, within two weeks of the deadline for Ravalli County Republicans to sign up to run for precinct captain, Hudson said he recruited 30 or so fellow Republicans for the positions.

“I just made up my mind I was going to do it,” Hudson said.
In 2018, Hudson’s son Wyatt died at the age of 19 in a car accident, and Hudson decided he could “crawl into the bottle,” or he could honor his son and family and improve the world. He’s also a rancher with a bias for action.
“​​As ranchers say, ‘We’ve been doing so much with so little for so long, we can do anything with nothing at all,’” Hudson said.
Hudson turned the names of GOP recruits into the county clerk five minutes before 5 p.m. on filing day, he said, and he turned to face the wrath of the central committee.
“These people went apoplectic,” Hudson said.
The Ravalli County Republican Central Committee took out a full page advertisement in the Bitterroot Star calling the new recruits “The Dirty Thirty.”
The letter, addressed “Dear neighbor,” said historically, the seats are difficult to fill, and “there are virtually never multiple candidates interested in the job.”
It accused Hudson’s recruits of using “dirty tricks” to try to “retake” the committee.
Most won at the ballot box anyway.
Typically, the central committee holds elections among precinct captains to select leadership positions, as state law and its bylaws require, but Stoltz, the chairman, never called for one.
“There was never a formal conversation about elections, but the implication always was, ‘We’re not going to have elections because the state party had decided to not have elections until basically the fall of 2026,’” Hudson said.
 Hudson takes Stoltz, central committee to court

In February 2025, Hudson took the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee and Stoltz to court, and he asked the judge to grant a type of relief legally defined as “an extraordinary remedy.”
He asked the court for a writ of mandate, an order that forces a public official to take action the person has a legal obligation to take, in this case, to hold the local election.
As he saw it, if the state GOP could amend its bylaws to preclude elections for a couple of years, he wasn’t sure what would stop it from doing so for longer.
In the complaint, Hudson alleged Stoltz had no authority to continue serving as chairman past April 1, 2025, but intended to control the local central committee “without election to office in 2025 through 2027.”
He alleged members of the Freedom Caucus intended to control the Republican platform and had taken control of many local committees, but its members knew local committees still weren’t “stacked in their favor.”
And he said Freedom Caucus members sought to extend their power anyway.
At the 2024 state convention, as outlined in court documents, GOP delegates amended party bylaws to say local elections should take place between Dec. 1 of each even-numbered year and March 31 of each odd-numbered year — starting on Dec. 1, 2026.
State convention delegates Paul Fielder, a Thompson Falls legislator, and Brad Tschida, former legislator from Missoula and former Public Service Commission director, drove the changes, according to the complaint. 
Stoltz did not respond to an email requesting comment, but according to the district court order, he argued the amendments meant no central committee election could be held until Dec. 1, 2026, and none could be held “until the State Chair authorizes” it.
The judge disagreed.
Until Dec. 1, 2026, the judge said the current rules for local elections remained in place, as did state statute, and she ordered Stoltz to hold one by April 1, 2025.
 Activists out, ‘old guard’ returns

To his credit, Stoltz complied with the district court order and called for the local election, said Matt Roth, current chairman of the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee.
He and others said Stoltz never showed up for it, nor did his allies.

In holding off on the local election, Roth said Stoltz was only following the directive of the state GOP, but the results contravened the rights of the people.
“It’s fundamentally against the law, fundamentally against the Constitution of the United States, and fundamentally against our republic,” Roth said.
He said he had hoped the new board would be mixed and include GOP members from across the political spectrum, but the Freedom Caucus activists did not show up.
Franklin, vice chairwoman, said in one way, the extremists sidelined themselves. She said she talked to eight people at a recent dinner who used to support Manzella and will no longer do so.
“They got too noisy and too obnoxious, and people stopped taking them as seriously as they used to,” Franklin said.
Roth said he took the helm of the local central committee reluctantly. He said he’s aligned with much of the Freedom Caucus ideology, but not with its means.
“My hope and prayer is that all conservatives in the valley come back to the table and have a good heartfelt discussion of how we move forward in 2026,” Roth said.
How the state GOP moves ahead is another matter.
 Order appealed, found moot

The case went to the Montana Supreme Court, and last month, the justices issued an order finding the matter was moot; the original controversy over the election in Ravalli County had ended.
It said Stoltz had not demonstrated the disputed part of the state Republican Party bylaws — “subject to amendment or clarification by the Party” — were likely to be applied in the same manner again.
“(Stoltz’s) suggestion that the other central committees might so apply the bylaws is speculative,” the order said.
The state Supreme Court also said the statute the district court relied on remained in place.
“The county central committee shall meet prior to the state convention of its political party and organize by electing a presiding officer and one or more vice presiding officers,” says the state statute.
In Ravalli County, the central committee bylaws require the local convention take place between Feb. 1 and April 1 of odd-numbered years, the order said.
Lawyer Abby Moscatel represented Stoltz in the appeal, and when reached by phone about Hudson vs. Stoltz, Moscatel stated she had no comment and hung up.
The Montana Republican Party did not answer questions about the guidance it gave to central committees, but a July 14 email and memo from Wittich told central committees that Montana GOP bylaws “trump county bylaws.”
In the email, Wittich said any county bylaws that conflict should be amended to be in compliance with state GOP bylaws.
“Please be advised that no county conventions will be called until December 1, 2026,” the email said.
The attached memo, also dated July 14 and marked “draft,” said GOP rules had been subject to “conflicting interpretations” and central committees may be “confused.” It did not reference the district court order or appeal.
Wittich did not answer questions for this story, including about any subsequent guidance the state GOP has given central committees.
“MT GOP wasn’t a party to the case and didn’t appear in the case, so we don’t have comment to provide,” Wittich said through a spokesperson.
 Moving forward

Some Ravalli County Republicans believe the results of the state GOP convention in June could be called into question if other counties also should have held local elections and had the chance to select state delegates.
In other words, if county central committees sent illegitimate delegates to the state convention, what does that mean for the results of elections at the state GOP?
“That’s a serious issue within the GOP that needs to be looked at,” Franklin said.
Mell said in the lawsuit, the party was trying to override statute and take the will of the people away. 
She said not every county has “a Tony,” but Republicans shouldn’t sit on their rights and assume those in control of the state party are controlling precincts as well.
A breadth of voices is needed to fairly represent the party, but people need to work for it, Mell said. 
“Complacency is death,” Mell said. “People need to know their rights and get involved and question — and not be afraid to question — the leadership of the GOP.
“It’s not a foregone conclusion. The local voices matter. And participation really matters.”
Hudson believes that without some change at the state GOP, a powerful minority will retain dominance at the expense of a party that once boasted about a big tent.
“(But) this is not their private club,” Hudson said.
Freedom Caucus Chairman Jerry Schillinger, a Republican legislator from Circle, said every party and group has different factions, and he isn’t concerned some members of his group may have besmirched its cause.
He said to be a member of any group is to accept the bumps and bruises it brings along the way and to be willing to have the backs of others despite their imperfections.
“If it ever came to an issue, whether it’s a Freedom Caucus or any other group, that some member is totally out of step with the goals and the ideals of that group, then likely that person will find themselves sitting on the outside,” Schillinger said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6127-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

The plaintiffs — Nicole White, Brent Smeins, Miria Schuster, Dave Wedeking, Devontez Roberts, Jeff Mason, Kimberly Browning, Anthony Haubrich, Gayle Robinson, Leland Williams and Kerigan Kammeyer — are each current or former emergency medical technicians or paramedics employed by the ambulance department of the Waverly Health Center.
WHC operates an array of medical clinics located in Waverly, Janesville, Nashua and Shell Rock.
The plaintiffs allege that while employed by WHC, they had a regular rotating schedule in which they worked a 24-hour shift and then received 48 hours off, while occasionally working additional hours beyond their regular shift.
In May 2022 and again in April 2023, WHC allegedly announced a policy to begin paying hourly employees who worked nights and weekends a “shift differential” in addition to their regular rate of pay. In August 2024, the policy was allegedly revised to state that hourly employees who worked nights and weekends would receive a shift differential of $2 to $15 per hour depending on when the hours were worked.
The lawsuit claims the 2022, 2023 and 2024 shift differential policies were communicated to the paramedics and EMTs by email, with each recipient required to review and acknowledge the policies electronically.
Despite this, the lawsuit claims, the EMTs and paramedics never were paid the applicable shift differentials.
The lawsuit, filed in state court before being transferred this week to federal court, seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of Iowa’s wage laws and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

(Screen capture by Kansas Reflector from MPSC meeting)Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved electric rates to ensure large power users on its system are responsible for paying their fair share of the effect their usage has on the power grid and other customers.
The Missouri Public Service Commission approved a large-load rate submitted by Evergy, which operates in Kansas and Missouri, and that was supported by most parties in the case.
Unlike in Kansas, where a large-user rate was unanimously agreed to by all intervenors, including business, environmental groups and a data service coalition, two groups did not support the Missouri order.
Missouri Public Service Commission staff and the Missouri Office of Public Counsel, an organization that advocates for small business and residential customers, did not support the order.
In fact, the staff and OPC submitted a separate proposal that commission chairwoman Kayla Hahn said was too confusing and could cause large users to avoid locating in Missouri.
“Staff’s proposal requires upwards of 25 different charges that a large user could be subject to paying,” she said. “The evidence showed us the vast amount of charges and uncertainty make it unclear if a large user would be paying too much, too little or more likely if a large user would forgo locating in Missouri altogether as even a sophisticated user would be unable to predict what its ultimate bill responsibility would be.”
The tariff reflects broad stakeholder consensus and “contains strong safeguards to ensure that large new loads pay their fair share while enabling growth that benefits Missouri,” the commissioners said in the order.
Large-load users were defined in the order as those requiring 75 megawatts per month at peak times, a parallel to the Kansas order approved Nov. 6 by the Kansas Corporation Commission.
“I’m satisfied that this will result in the large-load customers bearing the financial responsibility for the costs that are incurred for infrastructure improvement, be they transmission or generation,” said commissioner John Mitchell. “I’m also satisfied that the agreement does establish reasonable protections both for the existing customers and for the large-load customers, and ensure that the large-load customers will pay their fair share.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said Missouri rates include similar protections to those put in place in Kansas for existing customers by ensuring that companies pay their fair share for access to the grid. The rate for these new large customers is higher than that paid by existing commercial and industrial customers.
“This premium rate helps pay for modernization and maintenance of the power grid that is shared by all our customers,” she said. “In both Kansas and Missouri the commissions have recognized the value of attracting large energy users and the importance of making sure existing customers don’t foot the bill.”

It’s impossible to fully grasp food insecurity in Vermont without showing up and talking to people in pantries, churches and community centers across the state. During the government shutdown, when thousands of Vermonters faced a painful gap in benefits, the issue gained new urgency.
What I witnessed in recent weeks reminded me why this work matters, and why we depend on readers like you. Your support today powers fact-based local reporting and, through our partnership with the Vermont Foodbank, sends three meals to a neighbor.

Donate and send 3 meals

In the Statehouse, I watched officials debate and approve a $6 million plan to help combat hunger. In the days that followed, I met Vermonters who still had to wait a week for that relief, and heard reports of people watering down meals or skipping them altogether to make food last. Often, people were willing to share their stories, generously offering a window into their hardships.
With federal food benefits to resume, but many challenges still ahead, I will continue to follow the impacts of state programs and federal changes to food assistance. I will keep showing up and listening, not just to lawmakers and judges, but also to those their decisions impact most.
This Thanksgiving, your donation powers this kind of reporting. Reporting grounded in facts, informed by real experiences, and freely available to everyone. And through VTDigger’s partnership with the Vermont Foodbank, your gift also sends three meals to a neighbor in need.

“There was something there about taxes that I needed to figure out,” she recalled to a room packed with progressives here this week. “Here I am, I’m 45, and I’m fighting the same exact fight that I was fighting when I was 16.”
The upcoming bouts will be high-stakes, with lawmakers vexed by a budget shortfall that billions of dollars of tax increases, coupled with spending cuts, failed to resolve this year.
In the state Senate, Frame, who is from Seattle, is running point for Democrats on tax policy.
“The Revenue Queen.” That’s how Eli Taylor Goss, who leads the Washington State Budget and Policy Center, described her at the group’s Budget Matters Policy Summit, held this week at the Northwest African American Museum.
It was a crowd brimming with the belief that the state’s corporate titans and tech executives are not paying their fair share, and must shoulder more of the financial burden for publicly funded education and human services.
Pressure is building for Democrats to take a big swing on taxes, beyond this year’s hikes. How far Frame and her allies can deliver on that goal in 2026 is an open question. Next year’s legislative session, which begins in January, is just 60 days and happening ahead of an election.
“I want to have a future for Washington state where it’s not just a rich person’s playground,” Frame said. “I don’t want to be called the Cayman Islands of the United States.” (The Cayman Islands are considered a tax haven.)
One of the hotter ideas percolating is a possible income tax on wealthier individual earners. Early descriptions suggest a 9.9% tax on adjusted gross income above $1 million.
Senate Democrats have discussed the concept, and it’s circulating among insiders. There’s no draft bill or firm plan on paper yet, Frame told the Standard.
Two other significant — and controversial —  revenue bills are already on the table. One, the so-called wealth tax, sponsored by Frame, would tax certain assets, like stocks and bonds, over $50 million. Another would apply a payroll tax to large companies with higher earners.
‘Be prepared to win three times over’
Washington is one of nine states nationwide that do not tax individual wage and salary income.
For progressives, changing that is a holy grail in their quest to rebalance the state’s tax code so it falls less heavily on low-income households. It’s also a third rail. A concept Washington voters have repeatedly rejected and that the state Supreme Court has blocked.
Frame said during a panel discussion Wednesday that she’s “heard more chatter about the income tax in the last six months than I’ve heard in the last 15 years.” 
Cynics question if this surging interest has to do with businesses looking to prevent their taxes from climbing further by generating state revenue elsewhere.
That aside, Frame had a cautionary message for the audience — many of whom would be counted on to help enact such a tax.
“Passing that bill in the Legislature is the first step, not the last. We will need to fight and defend this in court. We will have to defend this at the ballot,” she said. “If we do it, we’d better be prepared to win three times over.”
“If we are going to do this, we need to do it right,” the senator added. “And all of you in this room know what that means, what it looks like, and we are going to be the ones that do the work.”
Wealth tax still in play
Frame’s still bullish on the wealth tax.
Her bill cleared the Senate on a 26-21 vote on the final day of this year’s session. The House didn’t debate it, and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson objected to relying on the tax to balance the budget, citing the likelihood it would get tied up in court.
Frame points to its strong public support and years of refining the legislation since it was first introduced in 2021.
“We have done everything to this bill that we could possibly do, and there is only one argument left,” she said. It’s that rich people will leave the state if the tax is imposed, she explained, adding that research indicates that’s not likely to happen.
Frame doesn’t shy away from her role as a tax champion, even though it puts her at the center of some of the toughest debates in Olympia. “Somebody’s got to do it,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/noel-frame-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

Rick Hoheisel, a Republican from Wichita and chair of a House-Senate oversight committee, says indictment of the former CEO of Texas-based Beneficient is sufficient cause to evaluate the state's issuance of a bank charter to Beneficient in 2021. The idea of an inquiry has bipartisan support. (Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Bipartisan support exists in the Kansas Legislature to scrutinize a state bank charter issued to a company whose founder has been indicted and accused of syphoning millions of dollars from a now-bankrupt business to finance his opulent lifestyle.
Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Republican from Wichita, said the Legislature should examine results of state law that guaranteed a charter in 2021 for Texas-based Beneficient, an alternative investment company relying on the banking credential to attract wealthy clients to its business of exchanging cash or stock for illiquid assets.
“Frankly, my committee will be looking at the TEFFI Act as we get into session,” Hoheisel said. “We will be taking a look at this whole thing.”
Hoheisel serves as chair of the House Financial Institutions and Pensions Committee, as well as the joint House and Senate oversight committee responsible for supervision of the TEFFI Act, which opened the door to Beneficent’s bank charter.
He said he wasn’t eager to pull the plug on Beneficient, because he wanted to offer the company’s executives “an opportunity to get this right.” The 2026 Legislature convenes in January.
Official exploration of Beneficient didn’t gain bipartisan traction until a federal indictment against Beneficient founder Brad Heppner for alleged securities and wire fraud. He was arrested in early November after a grand jury approved a five-count indictment alleging approximately $300 million had been transferred from GWG Holdings to Beneficient and that Heppner subsequently funneled more than $150 million of that total to a shell company he secretly controlled. Heppner was chairman of Beneficient and GWG Holdings from 2019 to 2021.
The FBI said Heppner “allegedly falsified documents, made misleading statements to investors and auditors, and obstructed an investigation by regulatory authorities.” He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
The indictment says Heppner purportedly spent $40 million on his Dallas home, $10 million for upkeep at the mansion and an East Texas ranch, $20 million to pay tax liabilities, $10 million for personal credit card debt and private air travel expenses, and $500,000 on jewelry.
In wake of the indictment, Democratic Rep. Rui Xu of Mission Hills said it was time the Legislature considered ending the state’s alliance with Beneficient by revoking the state bank charter.
The charter was authorized in April 2021 as a pilot project. The Legislature adopted a bill in 2022 requiring the charter be made permanent retroactive to December 2021. That bill was championed by Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Wichita, and signed into law by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
“All this stemmed from a poison seed, if you will. We just kept trying to water and water it,” Xu said. “Just from its inception this has smelled a little funny and continues to smell a little funny. This is not a thing, I think, Kansans want the state to be involved with.”
Sen. Brenda Dietrich, R-Topeka, said legislation ought to be introduced in the House and Senate to forbid state agencies from accepting receivership of any portion of Beneficient if the company filed for bankruptcy or was declared insolvent.
“I think we need to protect our state, protect our constituents,” Deitrich said. “That just makes sense.”
The TEFFI law was controversial because Kansas Bank Commissioner David Herndon opposed the unique arrangement with Beneficient, complained the Legislature placed unreasonable limits on state regulation of Beneficient and its subsidiaries. He also expressed frustration the Legislature wouldn’t consider revocation of Beneficient’s charter. Herndon’s pleas generally fell on deaf ears at the Statehouse.
To gain traction for legislation tied to Beneficient’s bank charter, the company’s allies donated thousands of dollars to Republican and Democratic politicians and directed cash to partisan political action committees in Kansas. The original bank charter bill unanimously passed by the Senate and was endorsed 103-20 in the House.
Lobbying led by Herndon, until he resigned from Beneficient in summer of 2025, included promises the partnership between the state and Beneficient would create an economic windfall for Kansas and trigger a surge in business development in rural Kansas.
In the past several years, questions were raised about Heppner, or others associated with Beneficient, possibly engaging in financial misconduct. Trustees working on behalf of investors in GWG Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in 2022, pursued lawsuits to claw back millions of dollars drained from GWG Holdings. In March, Beneficient’s executives and officers settled claims with GWG Holdings for $50.5 million. In addition, GWG Holdings’ litigation led to settlements of $30 million with a law firm and $8.5 million with an accounting firm.
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Hesston Republican who relentlessly championed the public-private partnership with Beneficient, said at one point the state’s association with Beneficient would enable $1 billion in global investment to flow through Kansas within a decade.
Owens said it would be folly to withdraw Beneficient’s bank charter by repealing the TEFFI Act, which stands for Technology-Enabled Fiduciary Financial Institutions Act.
“I absolutely reject this notion,” he said. “I reject the idea that right now is the time to repeal the TEFFI Act.”
He said legislation giving the bank commissioner the power to revoke Beneficient’s charter should include an appeal process to the Legislature.
Owens said he was frustrated the Kansas bank commissioner hadn’t been more supportive of the Beneficient venture. He complained the commissioner declined to develop regulations that might have encouraged other financial companies to locate in Kansas.
“It is my opinion that the office of state bank commissioner is hostile towards this act as a whole,” Owens said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4F5A0379jpg.jpg,,,2025-11-14 16:57:36.142633

The Republican governor, speaking to reporters, chastised the task force on Thursday for failing to put forward a map of new school districts, adding uncertainty to the upcoming legislative session.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott had some strong words for the school redistricting task force after the group endorsed a proposal on Monday to incentivize voluntary mergers of the state’s 119 school districts. The task force members, he told reporters, “didn’t fulfill their obligation.”
“They didn’t redraw the lines, and they were supposed to put forward three maps for consideration, and they failed,” Scott said.
Asked by a reporter where that leaves the state, Scott said that “it would appear that those who didn’t fulfill their obligation are OK with the ever-increasing property taxes, cost of education, and they don’t want to see change, or at least not immediately.”

“So, I think it puts us in a tough position, but I think the majority of people — I’ll include the speaker and the pro tem — understand we need change,” he said. “We need to do something. So, they’re going to have to act as soon as they get back in.”
Scott’s comments Monday underscore a growing sense of uncertainty around efforts to reform Vermont’s public education system.
Debate around public education reform will feature prominently in the next legislative session, set to begin in January. And while Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law, was signed in July, launching that reform will depend on the Legislature agreeing to a new district map.
But on Monday, the 11-member task force voted 8-3 to endorse a proposal that defied a core directive of Act 73: that the group put forward at least one and no more than three new maps by Dec. 1 for the Vermont Legislature to consider in the upcoming session.
Task force members Rep. Beth Quimby, R-Lyndon; Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia; and Dave Wolk, who is Scott’s appointee, voted no on the proposal.
The nearly 170-page proposal the group endorsed lays out a 10-year plan. Districts would be incentivized to merge to access state construction aid and to coordinate on developing regional high schools, while utilizing regional boards of cooperative educational services, or BOCES, to share the cost of services.
The only map contained within the proposal shows how the five regional cooperative service agencies proposed in the plan would layer over the state’s existing 119 school districts and 52 supervisory districts and supervisory unions.
Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders said during the meeting Monday the proposal did not adhere to the intent of the law.
Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, the co-chair of the task force, said in an interview that task force members did not “see evidence that there is cost savings and improvements to quality in merging districts.”
“As we peeled back the layers, as we dug deeper into the complexity of education in Vermont and the complexity of lowering costs and improving quality, we decided it would be irresponsible just to draw lines on a map,” Gulick said.
She continued that their proposal “could save money immediately” by allowing the state’s 119 school districts to share resources and create economies of scale through shared contracting.
“In three months to dig into this level of specificity, we did a great job given those parameters, and I’m really proud of the work that we did,” she said.
Senate Pro Tem Phil Baruth said in a text message that he was waiting for the task force to issue its final report before commenting.
Speaker of the House Jill Krowinski in an email said she was “focused on ensuring our kids have the best educational opportunities at a price Vermonters can afford.”
“That is my focus for the upcoming session, and it is the mission we have had since the beginning of our education transformation work,” she said. “We’ll continue to work with the education community, the Scott administration, and all Vermonters to consider the options before us and next steps to meet our education transformation goals.”
Another proposal considered by the task force, developed by Beck and Wolk, more closely adhered to those guidelines, and had Saunders’ apparent stamp of approval.
That proposal — now discontinued, at least as far as the task force is concerned — used career and technical education regions as an organizing principle to draw lines for 13 new school districts.
But the majority of task force members declined to support that proposal and raised concerns about the size of the map’s proposed district in Chittenden County. Nearly 22,000 students would be consolidated into a single district there under the plan.
Gulick in an interview said that map did not adhere to Act 73’s parameters that new districts have anywhere from 4,000 to 8,000 students.
“It’s supposed to be logistically feasible and create the least amount of disruption,” she said. “I just don’t think that that map did those things.”
The task force will meet for the last time on Nov. 20, where it will refine and finalize its final report due to the Legislature in December.
“I do hope the Legislature looks at what we’ve done. I hope they take our recommendations to heart,” Gulick said. “But there’s no guarantee that that will happen.”

Officials with the State Court Administrative Office […]","Getty ImagesThe excessive dependence on local governments to fund local trial courts, which puts pressure on judges to generate revenue for court operations and creates barriers to justice, could be a thing of the past if the Legislature acts on a new funding model proposed by the state’s judiciary.
Officials with the State Court Administrative Office and the legislatively-created Trial Court Funding Commission issued implementation recommendations last week to outline how the new model could work for the state, and the benefits of a new funding model both for the judiciary itself and the courts’ largest stakeholders – the people of Michigan.
The funding issues facing the trial courts now stem from the Michigan Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in People v. Cunningham, which found it was unconstitutional to assess defendants additional fees solely to fund court operations. The commission was formed as a way to find solutions to that problem.
The new model proposed by the commission would ask the Legislature to appropriate a larger share of state funding to the trial courts in order to equalize the amount and take pressure off local units of government to sustain trial court funding. Officials with the state court office and the commission call it a “maintenance of effort” requirement, which would ensure that local units of government contribute no more than that their historic average level of funding, with the state stepping in to appropriate additional funding as needed.

final-trial-court-funding-concept-paper-for-publication 
That would create a cost-sharing model between the state Legislature and the judiciary, especially when it concerns the cost of building new court facilities or making major renovations. The commission and the state court office are also proposing a court facility grant program to support that effort.
“For too long, local governments have borne the burden of funding Michigan’s trial courts, with the state contributing less than 15%,” Michael Bosanac, administrator and chief financial officer of Monroe County. “Having the state as a more balanced funding partner will reduce pressure on local governments as the primary funding source for trial courts.”
Bosanac said the model would provide local governments with financial predictability and reduce the need for local courts to assess excessive costs on court users to generate revenue.
“The plan strives to create better outcomes for all stakeholders – especially citizens of this state,” he added.
Additionally, the recommendations call for all court-generated revenue to be moved to a new fund managed not by the courts themselves but by the state’s Department of Treasury. The plan, if given the green light by the Legislature, would give the Treasury the duty to distribute court revenues to local governments solely for judiciary functions based on costs to run the courts. The local units of government, their courts and the state court office would develop and approve court budgets moving forward if the plan is enacted.
Although funding and sustainability are among some of the top reasons for the recommendations, a big piece of the change would alleviate the conflict of interest that exists between judges administering justice and the need to impose and collect court fees and fines as a way to generate revenue for the courts they serve.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, State Court Administrator Tom Boyd said stakeholder trust, and equal access to justice without the influence of revenue collection on a judge’s sentencing decisions, were top of mind for those devising the recommendations.
“Right now, we have profit motivated policing and profit motivated court systems,” he said. “Why do we need that tension between us and the community? The idea here is that the assessment of the court costs, we can figure out, not only the cost of the plaintiff and a speeding ticket, but the cost of the court in a criminal case, we can create formulas or have flat fees so that, again, there’s no incentive for the judge to inflate those numbers.”
Boyd and Bosanac presented the recommendations on Thursday to a joint session of the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee.

State Sen. Ruth Johnson (R-Groveland Township) asked if the plan would address situations where there were too many staff in a given court system, particularly concerning quasi-judicial staffers.
Boyd said there wasn’t a set of recommendations for individual counties yet, but local control would still run the court.
“We’re just going to tell you how many people you need,” Boyd said. “So there is a possibility that a court or two has more people than they need.”
Johnson noted that although the state court office and the commission had support from some stakeholders, the Michigan Association of Counties voiced concerns. She wondered if the judiciary was ready to move forward with the plan given that there were some who were wary of the changes.
Boyd said the consternation centered around the shifting away from guaranteed court revenue to a possible reliance on legislative appropriations.
“Is there the level of comfort with the annual appropriations process that they have with just waiting for the people in black robes to bring the cash in? There isn’t that level of comfort. We all live in this environment. We all watch the annual appropriations process,” Boyd said. “Many of us are involved in it. We trust that process. The question becomes, is it comfortable? No, as Mike [Bosanac] said, there’s going to be concern, because we’re moving from a steady stream of revenue coming from the judicial branch to back to the legislative branch, to say it’s your responsibility and your authority that’s being exercised on an annual basis. There will be concern about that.”
State Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), chair of the House committee, said she had concerns about some of the recommendations, but saw this plan as a good first step. She wondered about the phase in period of the new fund and other aspects. If the part of the plan aimed to avoid another round of kicking the sunset date down the line, Lightner said the heavy lift of the request would require another legislative vote to extend the sunset.
“There’s going to be more robust conversation on the function of some of these because … assessments and stuff like that don’t even fall under the judiciary budget. It’s under the Department of Corrections or general government, or whatever it may be,” Lightner said. “And I’m just curious what the plan is to kind of back fill some of the assessments, because it does end up being a lot of money, especially when you talk about in the trial court fund that no monies will ever lapse.”
Lightner added that she did have a desire to make the plan work.
On Friday, state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), a member of the House committee, questioned the commission’s assessment that inadequate funding resulted in abuses of broad sentencing discretion and the imposition of fees to make up budget deficits.
DeBoyer said the proposed changes refuse to delve into root causes of poorly run county court systems and that well-run courts shouldn’t see their funding impacted.
“This would require good actors who do not run a budget deficit to continually subsidize irresponsible actors. There are a handful of counties in our state that struggle with their court operations costs due to a variety of factors, including rampant mismanagement, ineffective collection methods, and other things,” DeBoyer said in a statement. “Counties like ones I represent should not be forced to pay for other counties who do not have their acts together and aren’t operating effectively. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not a plan, and it is a gateway to use this same approach with other funding shortfalls.”

(Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)Siembra NC, a North Carolina immigrant rights group, has launched a digital map showing where federal immigration officials have been sighted across the state.The goal is to help immigrants make informed decisions about their routes to school and work.
The website, called Ojo Obrero (“Look out, workers”), compiles sightings of immigration enforcement activity into a single, statewide map. Organizers say the tool is meant to counter misinformation and give communities a better sense of where enforcement activity has taken place as federal operations continue to disrupt daily life.
“We want this to be a resource for people to get a clear picture and make decisions accordingly,” Emanuel Gomez Gonzalez, Siembra NC communications strategist, told reporters during a virtual press conference. 
The map includes only verified sightings of federal immigration operations. Each report must be backed by video or testimonial evidence reviewed by attorneys and volunteer networks. Organizers said most initial reports don’t meet that standard and are left out. 
The information is not updated in real time. It can take several days to verify whether an incident involved federal agents or whether it was just local law enforcement activity.
“This is a tool designed to provide a point of reference for how those patterns are actually taking place in our state,” Gonzalez said, “to allow people to continue to go about their day to day lives, even as we anticipate rumors and sightings of federal immigration agents to increase.”
The platform allows users to filter incidents by type, such as traffic stops, and by time of day, helping parents and workers plan travel routes, especially during early-morning hours when enforcement actions are more common.
The website offers several tools beyond the map, including a digital “red card” with know-your-rights guidance, a chatbot trained on ACLU materials, and translation features for interacting with law enforcement.
It also provides county-level data on traffic-related arrests that have led to ICE detention. Siembra NC said risks are higher in Gaston, Union, and Montgomery counties, as well as in counties that recently signed 287(g) agreements, which allow local law enforcement to work more closely with immigration authorities.
The group cautioned that the map is not comprehensive and often shows only where federal agents were present, not whether arrests occurred.
Recent incidents cited by the organization include traffic stops in Sampson County, where Newton Grove police pulled over at least eight workers last week, and an October arrest in the Catawba County town of Brookford, where a man stopped for driving without a license was later handed over to ICE under a new local-federal agreement.
“Everyone deserves to get to work, school and back home safely,” Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena said in the release. She added that many immigrant workers are legally barred from obtaining driver’s licenses, calling arrests that lead to ICE detention “cruelty” that harms the state’s economy.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-1024x863.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture).The Missouri Department of Social Services announced Thursday that it will continue to issue partial payments of federal food benefits for November, while updating its systems to resume paying full amounts.
The announcement comes after President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation funding the federal government through the end of January and ending the shutdown he cited as the cause of delayed payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“With federal funding back in place, our team is moving swiftly to issue full November benefits,” said Jess Bax, director of the department, in a press release.
Baylee Watts, the department’s media director, said in an email that the department is working with its electronic benefits vendor to distribute full November benefits.
“As soon as we have confirmed the timing and what that will look like for different participants, we’ll be able to share more,” Watts said.
States across the country scrambled to comply with rapid-fire changes to federal guidance on whether and how to issue SNAP payments while Congress remained gridlocked on expiring healthcare tax credits.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture threatened on Saturday to impose financial penalties on states that had paid out full monthly benefits in keeping with a judge’s order on Nov. 6 that USDA fund the program. USDA had already changed its instructions on the amount of benefits states could include in partial payments.
Missouri began distributing partial benefits on Tuesday, with enrollees in the program receiving up to 65% of their normal monthly funds.
The intricacies of USDA directives on partial payments forced state agencies to make complex calculations under pressure, said Christine Woody, food security policy coordinator at Empower Missouri, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income residents.
“The (state) department did not cause this,” Woody said, “and they were working with what they had.”
Recipients qualifying for the maximum allowed for their household, according to USDA instructions, received 65% of their regular benefits. Households eligible for less than the maximum saw their payments reduced by a further 30% of their income. Initial guidance told states to reduce maximum allotments by 50%.
USDA “strongly encouraged” states in a policy memo Thursday to “begin the process of upgrading systems and updating state procedures” to make partial payments more quickly in the future. The memo noted that, even after Wednesday’s appropriations bill, there aren’t enough contingency funds to make full SNAP payments in November 2026 “in the event of a lapse of appropriations next year.”
Woody said Empower Missouri will advocate for more federal support in case SNAP runs out of funding in a future shutdown.
“I believe that there are things that the federal government could do,” Woody said, “to ensure that there’s more money in those contingency funds.”

Barring a final, unlikely intervention, 44-year-old Stephen Bryant will become the fifth person executed in South Carolina this year and the seventh since the process resumed in September 2024. Bryant pleaded guilty in 2008 to fatally shooting three people during a string of burglaries.
Nationwide, 42 people have been executed this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Bryant’s attorneys made a single final appeal to attempt to halt his execution, arguing lower courts never heard evidence that he suffered from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The state Supreme Court rejected that argument, allowing his execution to go ahead.
As of Friday afternoon, Bryant’s attorneys had not appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Gov. Henry McMaster could choose to commute Bryant’s sentence to life in prison, though the former prosecutor has not done so for any of the other six inmates put to death during his time in office.
Bryant opted to die by firing squad instead of lethal injection or electrocution, the other two methods allowed in state law. He will become the third person in the state to die using that method, putting South Carolina on par for the highest number of executions using firing squad. Utah is the only other state to have used the method since the death penalty resumed nationwide in 1976.
The state’s protocols for firing squad came under scrutiny after attorneys for the most recent inmate executed using the method, Mikal Mahdi, claimed the bullets mostly missed his heart. An autopsy of Mahdi showed two bullet holes instead of the expected three, leading lawyers to claim one of the marksmen missed.
Department of Corrections officials maintain nothing went wrong. Two bullets struck Mahdi in the exact same place, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain has said.
The crimes
Bryant was still on probation following three years in prison for attempted burglary when his deadly crime spree started Oct. 5, 2004, with a Sumter County home robbery. His plans, however, began before that, attorneys argued during his 2008 sentencing hearing.
For several days, Bryant drove his blue-and-white pickup truck around rural Sumter County, approaching isolated homes and spinning tales to anyone who answered the door when he knocked.
On Oct. 4, Bryant came to the home of Tom Dennis, which sat on several hundred acres of property far back from the road. Bryant told Dennis his brother stole his pickup truck and he needed help getting it out of a ditch, Dennis testified in court.
Dennis helped Bryant out and thought little of the interaction. The next day, Bryant returned to rob the house after Dennis left to attend Clemson’s homecoming football game. When Dennis went out to his office in an adjoining building the next morning, he discovered someone had stolen his laptop, briefcase and bag of money.
Bryant repeated his method three days later with James Ammons, another rural homeowner. That time, Bryant took only Ammons’ .40-caliber semiautomatic rifle and the shells Ammons kept on the nightstand.
Over the following days, Bryant used that gun to shoot four people, killing three.
The first came later that same day. Bryant went out to a popular fishing spot along the Wateree River. He walked up and down the Richland County side of the river, where Clinton Brown was fishing.
After a brief conversation, Bryant walked away. A few moments later, Brown felt a shot in his back, he testified in court. When he turned around, Bryant was already gone, he said.
Brown drove himself to the hospital, where he stayed for nine days but survived the gunshot wound. Brown died in 2017, at the age of 69.
The next day, Bryant went to his friend Cliff Gainey’s house to smoke marijuana and drink some beers, Bryant said in a later statement to police. When the beers ran out, Bryant drove the two of them to a nearby convenience store, where security video showed Gainey entering the store, then returning to Bryant’s truck parked outside, according to court records.
Bryant drove around for a while, until Gainey asked him to pull over so he could “take a leak,” Bryant told police. In separate statements, Bryant told police he thought Gainey was taking a knife out of his waistband, then that he thought Gainey was making sexual advances toward him.
Regardless of what happened, Bryant shot Gainey three times, he said.
“I don’t know exactly why I shot Cliff,” Bryant later said in a statement to police. “Only thing I can (think) is his actions brought back a bad memory and I felt scared.”
Bryant remembered “sitting on my knees crying for him because he was a friend,” police testified Bryant told them. When a passerby pulled up, Bryant got back in his truck and fled, he later told police.
Bryant went back to Gainey’s house and took all the electronics from the living room, along with a fish tank from his bedroom. At some point, Bryant started a fire, in what he claimed was an accident but prosecutors said was an act of arson.
Two days later, on Oct. 11, Bryant killed 62-year-old Willard Tietjen, who friends and family called TJ.
Bryant had come to Tietjen’s house several days earlier, claiming he needed to see Tietjen’s phone book to try and track down a friend’s phone number. Tietjen helped, and Bryant left without incident, Tietjen’s wife, Millard Tietjen, testified.
When he returned, Bryant said he told Tietjen his truck had overheated. Tietjen invited him in and began to talk about religion before becoming hostile, Bryant told police. Bryant shot him nine times, an autopsy showed.
Bryant stayed in Tietjen’s house long after killing him. He smoked Tietjen’s cigarettes and used his computer. He took Tietjen’s Masonic ring off his finger and cleaned off the blood in the sink. He rearranged the furniture and lit candles over Tietjen’s body, police testified.
“He was there for hours, enjoying his work, admiring what he had done,” solicitor Kelly Jackson told the judge during his trial.
When Tietjen’s wife and daughter called to check on him, Bryant answered his cellphone, calling himself “the prowler” and telling the women he killed Tietjen, the victim’s relatives testified in court.
Bryant also burned Tietjen’s eyes with a lit cigarette, set his goatee on fire and used Tietjen’s blood to write messages on the wall for police, according to court documents.
“Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” Bryant wrote on one wall, some of the letters in blood. On another was the word “catch,” also in blood, police testified.
Bryant’s note seemed to suggest he already planned to kill again, prosecutors argued. Two days later, around 4 a.m., he picked up Chris Burgess at a gas station, loaded his bicycle into the back of his pickup truck and drove off.
A hunter found Burgess’ body on the side of the road, shot three times, in a similar manner to Gaines, investigators testified.
“It was over for me,” Bryant told police he was thinking at the time.
Police arrested Bryant later that day. After initially trying to blame someone else, he confessed to the police, according to court testimony.
During his time in jail, Bryant racked up more charges for threatening a detention officer and severely beating another. Bryant pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced.
Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Tietjen’s killing because Bryant’s theft of jewelry and other items from the house qualified as an aggravating offense, according to court records. He received life sentences for the other slayings.
The victims
Most mornings, Bob Summers stopped by his friend Tietjen’s house for coffee, he testified during Bryant’s sentencing hearing. The morning of Tietjen’s death, Summers called to tell Tietjen a joke, as he often did.
Tietjen liked jokes, and he told good ones, Summers said. Summers liked to give him gag gifts, and he planned to give Tietjen a tie that looked like a bottle of Tabasco hot sauce before his death, he said.
Tietjen worked for the Air Force for 23 years, maintaining radar systems, his wife of 39 years testified. After retiring in 1985, he worked at hardware and electronics stores before eventually going into the insurance business, she said.
Tietjen was active in the local Masonic Lodge, and he was a Shriner, including driving a buggy he kept in the basement every time a parade happened in the area, she said.
When asked if she understood that Bryant could be put to death for killing her husband, Millard Tietjen told defense attorneys she was OK with that.
“I can’t say it would make it any better, but I feel he deserves a punishment because he made the choice to do what he did,” she said during the 2008 hearing.
Chris Gainey was 14 when Bryant shot his dad, Cliff Gainey, to death by the side of a road. During the sentencing hearing, he recalled fishing with his dad and watching movies, though he added he didn’t remember much else about their time together.
“The only thing I really remember, he used to always comment on me being — just always said I look just like him,” Chris Gainey testified. “My mama still says the same thing.”
Chris Burgess’ family missed him every day, his mother, Christine Burgess, wrote in a letter read out loud in court.
“We all loved him dearly,” the letter said. “The pain and suffering of this family will never go away.”
Stephen Bryant
In the months leading up to the killings, Bryant tried to get help for his deteriorating mental state, his aunt and grandmother told a judge.
That August, two months before his crime spree, Bryant sat down with his grandmother and aunt to ask for help. At his grandmother’s home, he clenched his hands on her glass-top coffee table, causing the whole table to shake, she recalled during his 2008 trial.
Bryant told the two about how his grandfather, his uncle and his older half-brother sexually and physically abused him throughout his childhood.
“He looked like he was being tortured,” his aunt, Terry Lee Bryant Caulder, testified during his trial. “It’s like his soul was just laid wide open. In his eyes, you could see he was hurting and suffering and he was living the abuse over again as it was coming out, what he was telling us.”
His grandmother, Shirley Freeman, suggested Bryant call a sexual abuse hotline, she said. Caulder found the number and handed the phone off to Bryant, who spoke to the person on the other end for a while, she testified.
The hotline seemed to offer no resources. His probation officer referred him to a nearby counseling center, but Bryant couldn’t afford to pay for the services, so he left without getting help.
He couldn’t sleep on the nights he picked up his victims at gas stations. He told police he remembered only bits and pieces of each incident, which experts testified could have been a symptom of his post-traumatic stress disorder, according to court records.
Bryant grew up in a troubled home, his attorneys have argued to multiple courts. His parents met and conceived him in a rehabilitation facility, though neither got sober. His mother drank during her pregnancy with him, she told attorneys during his appeals process.
Starting at the age of 17, he spent much of his life in and out of jail, always for non-violent offenses, defense attorneys said during his sentencing hearing.
The trauma of his early life, combined with the developmental effects of his mother’s drinking during her pregnancy, caused Bryant to snap and act outside his normal frame of mind, his attorneys argued during his appeals.
During his 17 years on death row, Bryant received two disciplinary sanctions, one for fighting without a weapon in 2009, and one for possessing a weapon in 2023, according to prison records.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado legislative leaders will soon vote on whether to extend or make permanent a system to livestream video of committee hearings at the Capitol.
The Executive Committee of the Legislative Council, made up of party leaders in both chambers, approved a pilot program earlier this year for video streaming in five committee rooms. Previously, only audio was livestreamed and archived for committee hearings, making Colorado an outlier among state legislatures.
Since then, people accessed committee video livestreams over 15,000 times during 35 meetings between July 30 and Nov. 5, according to a report from Legislative Council Staff. About 60% of those views were related to the planning, proceedings and aftermath of the special legislative session in August. The most-viewed meeting was an economic forecast to the Joint Budget Committee on Sept. 22.

“A major change during the process of the pilot project was that users can now see live slide presentations,” LCS Director Natalie Castle told lawmakers on Friday morning. “That was one of the things we heard from people that they were really happy to be able to see.”
The video stream shows the same view as a committee participant on Zoom, with a fixed wide shot on the committee room dais, remote participants and any materials being presented.
The pilot program has been extended until the end of the year.
“Video can make it easier for people to follow committee testimony as well as statements made by committee members, especially when speakers aren’t identified,” reads a letter of support from the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition and other organizations to Legislative Council. “Video provides context, allowing observers to see who is present and to gauge the emotions and reactions of lawmakers and others in the room. When people can watch the legislative process, they can better understand the legislative process, and that can foster more civic engagement.”
The Colorado General Assembly is currently the only state legislature in the country that does not provide video of committee hearings, according to a document shared earlier this year by the CFOIC.
The executive committee will vote on whether to make video streaming permanent at their next meeting. It would cost $20,000 to set up and then $50,000 per year, primarily for storage costs.
“I  want to voice my enthusiastic support of continuing and expanding what we have already done,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said. “I have had conversations and really appreciate the overall perceived value that this has brought to our public.”

Josh Stein speaks to reporters in Raleigh on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Governor Josh Stein is urging the public to not be provoked as U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive in Charlotte this weekend.
Stein said in a statement Friday that the agents arriving in Mecklenburg County should be focused on arresting violent criminals and drug traffickers.
“Unfortunately, that’s not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,” said Stein. “The vast majority of people they have detained have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”
Stein encouraged North Carolinians to remain peaceful and follow the law as they stand with their neighbors, and to document and report any problems with federal agents.
“When we see injustice, we bear witness. If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe long after these federal agents leave. That’s the North Carolina way.”
‘They need to stay home’
Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) didn’t mince words Friday when asked about the Border Patrol arriving in her district in an ongoing aggressive immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

“First of all, I think they need to stay home. We don’t need that kind of disruption,” said Adams. “We don’t need them coming in here antagonizing our citizens.”
The veteran Democratic congresswoman said she has heard from numerous constituents worried about how immigration enforcement will unfold in the Queen City.
“When I look at what has happened in other cities, how people have been treated, abused, even in physical ways, we don’t want that in Charlotte. We don’t need that in Charlotte,” Adams told reporters.
On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Tim Moore (NC-14), who also represents parts of Charlotte, said he supports bringing the Border Patrol into the city.
“I’m glad that they’re looking at doing that, and I’m glad at the way they’re approaching it,” said Moore in Raleigh.
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol does not comment on its plans, but Moore predicted the CBP would likely stay “for a while” and focus on organized crime.

Charlotte has been in the national spotlight since the killing of Ukrainian immigrant Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail system. The event prompted state lawmakers to pass an expansive crime bill this fall, which Gov. Stein signed.
Adams has said she prays for Zarutska’s family, but it is shameful for lawmakers to try to score cheap political points from the tragedy.
On Friday, Adams said the nation has watched immigration enforcement officials come into other cities only to have the situation quickly spiral out of control for the undocumented, the documented, and even local citizens.
“I just think that’s just unconscionable,” Adams lamented.
Like Stein, Adams is encouraging people who are planning to protest Border Patrol enforcement to do so peacefully.
“We certainly hope that these folks coming in here will just pass through and continue on their way,” said Adams.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3910-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Following a long and occasionally contentious Water Quality Control Commission meeting on Thursday, commissioners voted 7-4 to vacate a controversial vote from last summer that would have advanced a petition from an oil-and-gas industry-aligned group to expand the use of treated oil and gas wastewater, known as produced water.
Earlier this year, the WQCC adopted rules to allow for oil and gas wastewater pilot projects, but no discharges into surface or groundwater, a decision seen as a victory for environmental groups.
In June, a new petition by the industry-backed Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse Alliance requested the 12-member WQCC  rewrite its May rule, and allow 13 counties to use “treated produced water” for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and releases into the environment.
The WQCC subsequently, at a July 8 meeting, set a hearing on the WATR Alliance petition and, in its August meeting, amid strong opposition, rejected motions to quash the petition.
Several environmental groups in response filed motions for the board to vacate the July vote allowing the petition to proceed, and to disqualify seven of the WQCC’s members, saying their “impartiality and fairness” were “compromised by interference” from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. 
The latter allegation came in response to Santa Fe New Mexican reporting on an emailed exchange in July between staff at the governor’s office and cabinet heads appointed to the WQCC that encouraged them to attend the August meeting in-person and get the Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliances petition “over the finish line.” Those revelations also led to a protest outside the state environment department in September, with demonstrators calling for Environment Secretary James Kenney’s resignation.
Amid strong opposition, New Mexico water board lets plan for more oil and gas wastewater use proceed

The governor’s office has previously denied any wrongdoing. She has previously cited the state’s limited water supplies as a reason to explore expanded uses for oilfield wastewater. 
The governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman, in response to Thursday’s vote, said, “while it’s disappointing that the WQCC vacated the hearing prior to considering extensive water reuse research conducted in recent years, the Lujan Grisham administration will continue to work with stakeholders to implement the 50-Year Water Action Plan. The governor is focused on adopting comprehensive, science-based water reuse rules that are legally required under the Produced Water Act and crucial to protecting and preserving our freshwater resources for generations.”
The WQCC decided the decision of disqualification became “moot” after it vacated its July 8 vote.
Representatives from numerous conservation groups praised Thursday’s vote, with New Energy Economy Executive Director Mariel Nanasi calling it in a statement, a “huge victory for the people” and the now-overturned vote “the product of bias, undue influence, and a predetermined outcome.”
Tannis Fox, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, also said in a statement that the commission had “done the right thing…by wiping the state clean and avoiding any appearance of impropriety.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Zain-and-Vittoria-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma public schools won’t be able to adopt new social studies textbooks next year with academic standards for the subject still in flux. 
The State Textbook Committee voted Friday to suspend indefinitely the social studies textbook adoption cycle while the state Supreme Court and the Oklahoma State Department of Education consider what to do with the academic standards. 
A September Court order paused implementation of the new social studies standards, which became highly controversial for including Bible teachings and dubious claims about the 2020 presidential election and COVID-19. Public records show 12 textbook publishers chose not to return to Oklahoma after the new standards were approved.
Those 12 companies, including major publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, are currently on the state’s approved list but didn’t submit a bid this year for reapproval. Companies have withdrawn from Oklahoma before during a math adoption cycle in 2023.
Some of those companies informed the Education Department they had concerns about new content included in the social studies standards, said Sharon Morgan, program director for the agency’s Office of Standards and Learning.
“There were a few publishers that we’re familiar with that did reach out,” Morgan said. “They were concerned about a few of the objectives in the 2025 social studies standards, and they let us know that they would not be bidding.”
State Textbook Committee chairperson Sharon Morgan speaks during a meeting Friday at the Oklahoma State Department of Education in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Morgan said she doesn’t recall which publishers this entailed. She said the companies didn’t specify what new content was the source of their concerns, only that “they did not feel they could bid.”
The state received 12 bidders this year, including four not currently on the approved list.
In a typical cycle, the State Textbook Committee would have voted in November on final textbook adoption after considering review committees’ evaluations of each publisher. That vote would establish an approved list that schools could choose from when spending their textbook funds.
That vote couldn’t happen Friday with the social studies standards on hold, said Morgan, who was recently appointed as the committee’s chairperson.
“We’re hoping this is resolved by February and we know what our standards are,” she told the committee during Friday’s meeting.
In the meantime, public schools will continue using social studies standards and textbooks adopted in 2019.
New state Superintendent Lindel Fields said his administration intends to reexamine the 2025 standards. He told news reporters last month he expects “there will be some changes to them,” which would need agreement from the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature.
Fields replaced former state Superintendent Ryan Walters in October. Walters, who resigned Sept. 30, led the development of the 2025 social studies standards.
Publishers would have another opportunity to bid once the standards are finalized, Morgan said. Having a final version of the standards by February would give companies time to decide whether to submit an intent to bid by April.
Delays in the current adoption cycle could force the textbook committee and its review teams to consider both social studies and science materials in 2026, Morgan said. It also could push three other subjects on the 2026 schedule — health, physical education and vocational education — to later years, she said.

(Screen capture by Kansas Reflector from MPSC meeting)TOPEKA — Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved a tariff to ensure large power users on its system are responsible for paying their fair share of the effect their usage has on the power grid and other customers. 
The Missouri Public Service Commission approved a large-load tariff submitted by Evergy, which operates in Kansas and Missouri, and that was supported by most parties in the case. 
Unlike in Kansas, where a large-user tariff was unanimously agreed to by all intervenors, including business, environmental groups and a data service coalition, two groups did not support the Missouri order.
Missouri Public Service Commission staff and the Missouri Office of Public Counsel, an organization that advocates for small business and residential customers, did not support the order. 
In fact, the staff and OPC submitted a separate proposal that commission chairwoman Kayla Hahn said was too confusing and could cause large users to avoid locating in Missouri.
“Staff’s proposal requires upwards of 25 different charges that a large user could be subject to paying,” she said. “The evidence showed us the vast amount of charges and uncertainty make it unclear if a large user would be paying too much, too little or more likely if a large user would forgo locating in Missouri altogether as even a sophisticated user would be unable to predict what its ultimate bill responsibility would be.”
The tariff reflects broad stakeholder consensus and “contains strong safeguards to ensure that large new loads pay their fair share while enabling growth that benefits Missouri,” the commissioners said in the order.
Large-load users were defined in the order as those requiring 75 megawatts per month at peak times, a parallel to the Kansas order approved Nov. 6 by the Kansas Corporation Commission.
“I’m satisfied that this will result in the large-load customers bearing the financial responsibility for the costs that are incurred for infrastructure improvement, be they transmission or generation,” said commissioner John Mitchell. “I’m also satisfied that the agreement does establish reasonable protections both for the existing customers and for the large-load customers, and ensure that the large-load customers will pay their fair share.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said Missouri rates include similar protections to those put in place in Kansas for existing customers by ensuring that companies pay their fair share for access to the grid. The rate for these new large customers is higher than that paid by existing commercial and industrial customers. 
“This premium rate helps pay for modernization and maintenance of the power grid that is shared by all our customers,” she said. “In both Kansas and Missouri the commissions have recognized the value of attracting large energy users and the importance of making sure existing customers don’t foot the bill.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hahn-at-mpsc-1024x565.png,,,2025-11-14 15:58:38.563912

The Mississippi Board of Education voted to take over the school district during a special called meeting Friday. District officials had reached out to the state education agency on Oct. 30 because the school system couldn’t make its November payroll. 
“This was a difficult but necessary decision to protect the educational interests of students in Okolona,” State Superintendent Lance Evans said in a statement. “The financial challenges facing this district have reached a point where state intervention is required to ensure students continue to receive the education they deserve.”
Over the past two weeks, Mississippi Department of Education officials have been meeting with district leaders to determine the financial state of Okolona schools. The district sent the agency some paperwork that show a budget shortfall of more than $100,000, but other financial documents, such as payments to vendors, were incomplete, according to information state education officials presented.
Education department officials discovered that the district hasn’t had a financial audit since 2021, and has been outspending since fiscal year 2023-24. 
“That’s part of the work … for our staff to perform, really, a forensic account and review of their finances,” said Kymberly Wiggins, the agency’s chief operating officer.
The state board determined today that the district’s situation was critical enough to warrant a takeover, citing ongoing insolvency and a pattern of financial mismanagement and accreditation violations. Effective immediately, John Ferrell, the agency’s chief of school and district transformation, will become Okolona’s interim superintendent. The district will get financial relief through the state’s school district emergency assistance fund. 
Without intervention, Okolona schools would continue to have “an inadequate and unstable educational environment, thereby denying the students of the district the opportunity to learn to excel and to obtain a free and appropriate public education,” said Matt Miller, president of the state board of education.
The state took over the district in 2010 for similar financial issues and accreditation violations. Okolona was also academically failing then. The state returned the district to local control in 2012.
“This is a total shock to me,” said Okolona Mayor Sherman Carouthers, a lifelong resident of the area. “We’ve seen so much improvement. You’ve really caught me off guard. This is something I’m going to have to process.”
Since 2017, the district’s academic rating has improved from a D to a B. 
“The educator part of the district has done quite well,” state board member Mary Werner said during the meeting. “But the leadership has failed miserably.” 
Barbara Carouthers, the Okolona school board chaplain and a distant relative of the mayor, would not answer questions when reached by Mississippi Today.

Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray announced Friday afternoon that the Senate won’t take up the issue as was expected in an unusual December session.
“Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state’s congressional maps,” Bray said in a statement released by his office. “Today, I’m announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December.”
Indiana lawmakers were scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters. That included two trips to Indianapolis by Vice President JD Vance.

Ten colleges from four nearby states have filed a brief in support of Middlebury College, arguing the case has broader implications on colleges' and nonprofits' obligations to donors who contribute gifts.

Former Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas has appealed his lawsuit against Middlebury College to the Vermont Supreme Court — the latest development in a years-long legal dispute over the naming of the college’s Middlebury Chapel.
Douglas’ lawsuit, first filed in 2023, sought to reverse a decision to remove former Gov. John A. Mead’s name from the college’s chapel. Mead’s descendents supported Douglas’ appointment as a special administrator of Mead’s estate before he filed suit.
Mead served as Vermont’s 53rd governor of Vermont from 1910 to 1912. Douglas, meanwhile, served as the state’s 80th governor from 2003 to 2011.

The building had for a century stood as the Mead Memorial Chapel, named after the former governor and longtime trustee of the college. But in 2021, the college, amid a statewide reckoning over Vermont’s history of eugenics, decided to rename the building, Middlebury Chapel.
Douglas argued this was a breach of contract and of good faith. Mead, who helped the college pay for the chapel’s construction, included in his offer that the chapel bear the Mead name in perpetuity, Douglas said in court documents.
Vermont Superior Court Robert Mello in April granted Middlebury College summary judgement, dismissing Douglas’ claims and resolving the case without a trial.
But Douglas, in his appeal to the Supreme Court, argues that the Superior Court erred when it concluded that there were no naming terms laid out in the contract between the college and Mead. The court, Douglas said in legal documents, instead “imposed its interpretation of a ‘reasonable time’ for the name to remain on the chapel — which it decreed was 100 years.”
The former governor is asking the court to remand the case back to Superior Court to consider whether there was a clear contract with an enforceable promise — that is, “whether the Mead name would remain on the chapel as a memorial, for as long as the building existed,” Douglas said in court filings.
“The structure that John Mead built was both a Memorial and a Chapel, and memorials have no end-date; they are always meant to be for as long as the memorial stands,” Douglas wrote in an email.
An attorney representing the college did not respond to a voicemail seeking comment, and a media relations employee with the college did not return a request for comment. The college previously argued in Superior Court that no clear request to keep the name in perpetuity can be found in available documents.
“John Abner Mead had the gratification of seeing his wishes for construction of a prominent chapel on Middlebury’s campus brought to fruition — and, indeed, that chapel bore his name in recognition of the gift for over a century thereafter,” the college wrote in a Superior Court filing. “But, as Mead did not expressly condition his gift on the use of his name, Middlebury was not legally bound to preserve the appellation ‘Mead Memorial Chapel’ name in perpetuity.”
The legal case serves as a reminder of Vermont’s history with eugenics in the early 20th century. In his appeal, Douglas makes the argument that Middlebury College itself was much more influential in that movement than Mead.
But the matter has also drawn the attention of other colleges and universities who argue the case has broader implications to consider regarding colleges’ and nonprofits’ obligations to donors who contribute gifts.
Ten colleges from four nearby states — including Tufts University, Amherst College and Wellesley College — have filed an amicus brief with the court in support of Middlebury College.
These types of institutions, lawyers wrote in legal documents, handle tens of thousands of donations, some made generations ago. The handling of these gifts are settled under common law, “which generally prohibit donor standing to pursue claims with respect to a completed gift,” they wrote.
A departure from that practice, the colleges argue, “would upend the current system,” they wrote in the brief. 
“It would result in significantly increased litigation for the courts as well as unnecessary administrative and legal costs for institutions like Middlebury and the colleges, requiring them to expend funds that would otherwise support their charitable purposes,” they wrote.
‘The altar of public relations’
The state Superior Court noted in its decision to dismiss the case that “no explicit reference to perpetuity” existed at the time. Douglas argues in his appeal that none was necessary.
“Why would anyone have foreseen the need to have a ‘perpetual clause’ dictating the behavior of a college whose leaders were his dear friends?” Douglas said in court documents. “Even the judge allowed for the fact that there could have been a contract — he just decided that if there was one, it had expired. We believe that a jury should make that determination.”
The Supreme Court has yet to schedule a hearing on the matter.
The college, in its removal of Mead’s name, pointed to a farewell speech that Mead made to Vermont’s General Assembly in 1912 where he espoused eugenicist ideas.
Mead told lawmakers in his speech that a “class of individuals in whose mental or nervous construction there is something lacking” were “increasing out of all proportion to the normal growth of the population.”
He continued that “most of the insane, the epileptics, the imbeciles, the idiots, the sexual perverts, together with many of the confirmed inebriates, prostitutes, tramps and criminals” in state’s jails, asylums and poor farms were “the results of these intermarriages or the natural offspring of defective parents.”
Mead encouraged lawmakers in Vermont to consider “how best to restrain this defective class and how best to restrict the propagation of defective children,” he said.
Douglas has said previously that Mead’s speech ultimately did not have a significant impact on Vermont’s eugenic sterilization policies, which were instituted after Mead’s death in 1920.
In his appeal, Douglas said that Mead, in his 1912 address, was “speaking as a physician,” that he “cautiously referenced vasectomy as a safer alternative to other sterilization practices,” and was “motivated by medical concern for women’s health rather than ideological adherence to eugenics.”
Douglas instead pointed to the college’s own history with eugenics, and wrote in his appeal that the college “sought to distance itself from Vermont’s eugenics history by scapegoating Mead while concealing its own extensive role.”
The college for more than 50 years, he said, “promoted eugenics through teaching, scholarship, and advocacy — even after the Holocaust revealed the catastrophic consequences of eugenic theory.”
Douglas in his appeal likened the college’s removal of the Mead name from the chapel to a “hypocritical public relations smear campaign to scapegoat” Mead.
The college “sacrificed Governor Mead on the altar of public relations,” Douglas wrote, and “used him as a subterfuge to conceal the fact that Middlebury College was literally, a Eugenicist Factory, for over 50 years.”
The college had courses in sociology, biology and zoology that emphasized race, heredity and biological problems, Douglas wrote, and the college was one of 44 institutions listed in the 1914 Journal Heredity as teaching eugenics.
In an email, Douglas said the institutions arguing in support of Middlebury College “want to maintain their aversion to allowing unpopular views on their campuses & to ensure the right to cancel their own generous alumni donors.”
“If I were to present a substantial gift to a college, I’d be concerned that, at some point in the future, its leaders would discover some obscure statement of mine that justifies the same shabby treatment that was visited on Gov. Mead,” he wrote.

Wintersteen spoke in front of the board about ISU’s accomplishments and efficiencies for the last time Thursday before her coming retirement in January. Members of the board, as well as University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook and University of Iowa President Barbara Wilson, said Wintersteen will be missed.
“The Iowa Board of Regents expresses its deep gratitude to President Wintersteen for her expertise, dedication and extraordinary service to the board of regents, Iowa State University, its students and families and all Iowans,” Bates said.

The ISU president expressed her gratitude for the board as well, saying she sees “the countless hours, energy and effort that every regent provides for this voluntary service,” and every Iowan owes them a big thanks for their commitment.
While Wintersteen has been serving as ISU president — the first woman in the role, Bates said — for nine years, her tenure at the university spans nearly five decades. She was also one of the first women to work as an ISU Extension associate in integrated pest management, according to her online biography, and earned her doctorate in entomology before becoming a professor of the topic.
Wintersteen also held different administrative roles at ISU throughout her career, including dean of the college of agriculture and life sciences and director of the Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station, her biography stated. She officially became ISU’s president on Nov. 20, 2017.
“Under her leadership, Iowa State raised a record breaking $1.5242 billion for the Forever True for Iowa State campaign with $500 million dedicated for student support, including more than 50,000 donor funded scholarships,” Bates said.
The board selected North Dakota State University President David Cook to succeed Wintersteen as president, but with his contract beginning March 1 and Wintersteen’s ending at the beginning of January, an interim president was needed to fill the gap.
Bates announced at the board’s Thursday meeting that David Spalding, ISU vice president for economic development and industry relations, will serve as interim president starting Jan. 3. His annual salary was set at $600,000.
Spalding did not attend the board meeting announcing his selection, but Bates said “we’re certainly grateful that he accepted this interim position.”

Three county commissions in Southeastern New Mexico have met so far this month to select nominees to replace Nicholas Paul in the state Senate. 
Paul, a Republican in Alamogordo, announced his resignation in mid-October due to health reasons after less than a year in the seat. Because Senate District 33 covers parts of three counties, commissions in Otero, Chaves and Lincoln Counties met to nominate potential replacements.
All three selected different names, one of the nominees and officials from the counties told Source New Mexico this week. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will choose from that list a senator to serve the rest of Paul’s term, which ends in 2028.
The three nominees are current state Rep. John Block (R-Carlsbad), along with Lincoln County Commission Chair Mark Fischer and Rex Wilson, who was the Southern region director of Presbyterian Medical Services until 2024.

The governor is expected to choose Paul’s replacement before the 30-day legislative session begins Jan. 20, according to Brandon Harris, a Senate GOP spokesperson. 
The county commissions considered eight potential replacements, according to commission meeting minutes. Other candidates included Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford, Otero County Attorney RB Nichols, former state Rep. Zachary Cook, business owner Benjamin Luna Jr., and Matthew Wade, a former 12th Judicial District deputy district attorney.
Otero County’s pick: Rep. John Block
In a cover letter, Block, who has represented House District 51 since 2023, said he should replace Paul in the Senate due to his record in the House, where he noted his “impeccable” attendance at interim legislative meetings and regular rankings as the most conservative state House member, where Republicans are in the minority.
Block wrote on Facebook on Nov. 8 that the County Commission selected him. Otero County officials did not respond to Source’s request for comment Friday. 
Former U.S. Rep. Yvette Herrell, a Republican, wrote a letter endorsing Block. So did Jerrett Perry, the executive director of the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce, and Michelle Perry, a small business owner in the area who also runs a charter.

Lincoln County’s pick: Commission Chair Mark Fischer
Fischer touted his role leading the commission through recent wildfires and floods and advocating for the county’s interests at the Roundhouse. If chosen, he said he’d work to advance the county’s tourism and horse-racing industries while seeking to expand logging and agriculture. 
“Lincoln County as well as the whole state needs oil and gas, and I have always supported that,” he wrote.
Chaves County’s pick: Rex Wilson
Wilson, who also served two terms as a Lincoln County commissioner, wrote in a cover letter that his 18 years as a healthcare administrator and history as a multigenerational rancher in Lincoln County make him a good fit for the Senate seat. 
He also said he started Camp Sierra Blanca at Fort Stanton in Lincoln County, a “nationally recognized alternative education model” that gives troubled young people a “second chance through non-traditional pathways.”

He touted his work with young people there and at Presbyterian directing early childhood services as necessary experience for the Senate.

(Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)New federal rules issued last week constitute the “most devastating housing cuts in modern U.S. history,” according to Minnesota organizations that provide housing to people exiting homelessness. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pays for a large portion of supportive housing services across the country — developments that house people with disabilities who are transitioning out of homelessness for free or at a deep discount. Supportive housing developments typically also offer on-site services like case management, mental health treatment and job training. 
More than 3,600 Minnesotans live in supportive housing, and last year Minnesota organizations received around $48 million in federal funding from Continuum of Care grants, the HUD program funding homelessness solutions.
The new rules will cut federal spending on permanent supportive housing by more than half, forcing the organizations that provide housing to find new funding sources and cut spending — likely by reducing the number of buildings they operate and people they serve.
The rules would effectively double chronic homelessness, according to a press release from a coalition of 185 Minnesota organizations opposed to the cuts.
Existing supportive housing developments can typically count on retaining around 90% of their base federal funding year-over-year. But the new rules drop that number to 30%, meaning some developments could face sudden, steep budget cuts. 
The press release says “these shifts could reduce funding for permanent housing by more than 85% and strip away both the scale and flexibility of the nation’s primary homelessness response system.”
The Reformer reported in September that HUD canceled Continuum of Care grants that it had awarded to Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative for the construction of two new supportive housing developments. 
When HUD reopened the grant application, it contained the priorities of President Donald Trump. 
To receive grants under the rewritten program, projects must be in a city, county and state that prohibit public camping, drug use and squatting and enforce those prohibitions; cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and follow certain standards for involuntary commitment. 
It also bars applicants who “deny the sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic” and those who “knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia…under the pretext of ‘harm reduction.’”
Minnesota doesn’t qualify under several of the provisions. For instance, Minnesota is a trans refuge state and many local law enforcement jurisdictions do not enforce federal immigration law, which is considered a federal, not a state or local responsibility.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51668526145_e737307647_o-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-11-14 14:57:51.767846

Screenshot. After nearly three hours of public comment, the Michigan State Board of Education voted along party lines Thursday, 6-2, to pass updated health education and sex ed guidelines that include recommendations to teach students about LGBTQ+ identities. 
“I am proud of what we just did,” said Dr. Pamela Pugh, the board’s president. “We made safer spaces for students, all students.”
The debate generally boiled down to those in support of the new guidelines advocating for the inclusion of LGBTQ+ students in public school curricula, while those opposed cited questions of parental rights and religious freedoms. 
The state’s guidelines had not been updated since 2007, and the newly voted-in standards include guidance on coverage of sexual orientation, gender identity, consent and safe sex practices, which previously had not been a part of the curriculum. 
“We are not pushing anything,” said board member Tiffany Tilley. “We are doing our jobs, though, which is making sure that some very old standards and guidelines are being updated today.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Multiple current and former Michigan public school students, many themselves part of the LGBTQ+ community, spoke about how they felt excluded from school curricula, especially sex ed lessons, when people who shared their identities were not discussed. 
Over 100 residents attended the meeting to give public comment, leading the board to shorten each comment from three minutes to one. 
The standards maintained, in accordance with state law, requirements for parental notification and options to opt-out of sex ed courses, which staff members present from the Department of Education repeatedly emphasized. 
“I argue today we have found that many people believe that parental rights should be taken away,” said Nikki Snyder, one of the Republican members of the board who voted against the changes. 
“A lot of people talk about all parents have rights. Their children have rights. Not just the people who opposed the proposal. I am a parent. I’ve got rights,” said board member Marshall Bullock. “Because parental rights come with a responsibility.”

Snyder repeatedly called presenters from the Michigan Department of Education liars — which led interim superintendent Sue Carnell to interrupt her and call for her to respect the staff, though Snyder repeatedly interjected into questions from other board members. 
“There is a Board of Education massive overstep that is happening,” she said. 
“It is a true grooming going on,” said the other Republican on the board, Tom McMillin, utilizing an oft-used trope to falsely assert that members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies are sexual predators.
“You said that people at this table were groomers and intentional groomers,” Pugh responded. “You need to retract that. Those are dangerous words and you need to be careful what you say at this table.”
Presenters from the Department of Education also noted that public comment outside of meetings was largely split between those in favor and those opposed to the guidelines. 
Of 1,388 formal surveys received, 924 opposed the update while 250 supported it. Outside of the actual formal survey system, the Department of Education received over 2,000 emails on the issue during the 30-day public comment period — 896 opposed and over 1,100 in favor. 
“This is not fringe, this is the mainstream of Michigan education,” Taryn Gal, executive director of the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health, said during the meeting. “The people responsible for educating your students support the standards because they are grounded in evidence, aligned with national best practices and designed to meet the real needs of students today.”
“What about when the science is corrupted, right?” countered pastor Danny Soria, one of the nearly 50 pastors that signed a letter to the board opposing the new standards. “We find ourselves in biblical times at critical crossroads. We bear the profound responsibility to make wise and morally sound decisions. Those choices must be guided, not by a distorted or perverse moral compass, but by a biblical and constitutional perspective, one that holds the rule of law.”
“The only thing that matters is the parents,” said John Grossenbacher, who submitted a petition signed by over 1,600 parents in opposition to the standards. “They are against this.”
Three parent organizations submitted formal letters of support to the Board — The Michigan Parent Teacher Association, Parent Action for Healthy Kids and Red Wine & Blue Michigan.

Becky Jo Hadlock requested a trial to contest a misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena. 
The post Weston County clerk pleads not guilty in subpoena case appeared first on WyoFile .","An eastern Wyoming clerk under fire for her actions during the November 2024 election pleaded not guilty Friday to failing to appear at a legislative hearing where she had been subpoenaed to testify.
Weston County Clerk Becky Jo Hadlock entered her plea during a brief appearance in Natrona County Circuit Court. Her attorney, Ryan Semerad, told the court his client wanted a trial.
Hadlock faces a single misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena that required her to testify before a panel investigating her office in connection with errors that occurred during the November 2024 election. She faces up to six months in jail and a $100 fine if convicted.
Circuit Judge Cynthia K. Sweet set a $500 personal recognizance bond for Hadlock, meaning the defendant won’t have to put up any money to remain free as long as she makes future court appearances.

Court records show a handful of lawmakers spoke with authorities during the criminal investigation surrounding Hadlock. But a reporter did not see any legislators in attendance at Friday’s hearing.
The criminal case comes amid growing scrutiny of Wyoming’s elections system. Republican lawmakers filed 45 election bills during the last legislative session — a striking number for one topic in a single year. Hadlock’s actions have fueled calls for additional legislation, including to move Wyoming to a hand-count voting system.
Election errors
State lawmakers and other officials began to scrutinize Hadlock’s actions soon after errors in the November 2024 election resulted in a dramatic undercount of votes for Rep. Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, in last year’s general election. Neiman was the majority floor leader at the time and is now the House speaker.
Hadlock, it was later learned, had printed out three versions of the ballot because of errors on the first two. That itself wasn’t a problem — clerks sometimes reprint ballots to correct misprints and other errors. But the clerk’s office gave some voters the incorrect first and second versions, which resulted in tabulators miscounting votes for Neiman, who was running unopposed for House District 1, and a county commission race.  
The result showed Neiman initially receiving only 166 votes, with another 1,289 voters leaving that race blank — what’s known as an undervote.
Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Wyoming’s top elections official, noticed the error and tried to contact Hadlock on election night. When she didn’t answer, he sent sheriff’s deputies to her home.

Multiple investigations ensued. After his inquiry, Gray recommended Hadlock’s removal from office. Gov. Mark Godon came to a different conclusion. He decided that Hadlock made serious mistakes, but those errors did not amount to misconduct and malfeasance — the level needed to seek her removal from office. Gordon also stressed the serious nature of recommending the removal of a lawfully elected county official, writing that “the decision of who should fill a county office is best made by the people of Weston County in the next election just a little over a year away.” 
The Wyoming Legislature also launched its own examination, forming a subcommittee to do that work. The Weston County Clerk 2024 General Election Subcommittee met Sept. 29 in Casper to continue its investigation.
Hadlock had been served with the subpoena on Sept. 23, according to a sworn statement by a Natrona County sheriff’s investigator. She emailed lawmakers two days later, informing them she would not attend due to a scheduling conflict.

The clerk later told the sheriff’s investigator that while she did receive a subpoena, she had personal business in Gillette on the day of the hearing. Specifically, she and her mother both had doctors appointments scheduled for that date.
That decision contributed to a new inquiry by the governor’s office into Hadlock’s actions. Last month, Gordon announced he’d received two additional complaints against the embattled clerk. One accused her of filing a false post-election audit following the 2024 general election. A second referenced her refusal to testify despite the subpoena.
After that investigation is complete, Gordon will decide whether to recommend that a court remove Hadlock from office. The governor cannot unilaterally remove her.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Department of Human Services is issuing full food stamp benefits for November following the end of the federal government shutdown.
The agency had previously begun issuing partial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits earlier this week.
Most recipients should soon have access to their full benefits, the agency said in a press release.
“We are grateful for this resolution and for the ability to move quickly to restore full benefits,” said Sondra Shelby, director of adult and family services. “Our teams have worked tirelessly to prepare systems so that Oklahomans receive the full support available to them without delay.”
Recipients do not need to take any action as benefits will be issued automatically.
More than 680,000 Oklahomans receive the benefits, commonly known as food stamps.
Last month, the Contingency Review Board met and approved the distribution of $1 million per week to food banks for up to seven weeks, contingent on a lack of federal funds. The funding was to come from the state emergency fund.
Carrie Snodgrass, a DHS spokesperson, said that $1.5 million had been distributed. The distributions are ending because the federal dollars were made available, she said.

U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said he needed more time to make a decision, adding he would have an update on the matter by the next hearing on Nov. 19. 
JXN Water also received news Wednesday that Congress approved to set aside $54 million for daily operations, Ted Henifin, the manager of the third-party utility, said. Lawmakers had already awarded the funds to the city, but initially did so only for capital projects. 
Since 2022, the utility has made relatively fast strides improving water pressure throughout Jackson as well as repairing burst sewer lines across the city. Moreover, for the first time in a decade, the water system is compliant with all federal drinking water regulations, Henifin said last week.

But without added revenue, JXN Water said it will continue to lose money and be unable to address sewer system repairs, including two major, ongoing overflows – one on Mill Street and another on I-55 near Home Depot.
Since the spring, Henifin has pleaded with the court for a rate increase after JXN Water ran out of its initial $150 million allocated for daily system upkeep. The hike would raise the average Jacksonian’s monthly bill – which includes costs for drinking water as well as garbage pickup and wastewater – by 12%, the utility says. 
City officials, including Mayor John Horhn as well as all of the Jackson City Council, have argued the utility shouldn’t be able to charge more until it collects payments from a broader swath of the city. 
Even if JXN Water had a 100% collections rate – it currently sits around 70%, far below the national average of over 90% – those bills wouldn’t yield enough revenue to keep the utility from losing money, Henifin has repeatedly told critics of his proposal. 
Jackson officials, attorneys for the ACLU, and Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat whose district includes south Jackson, all spoke against the rate increase during a status conference in front of Wingate on Thursday. Wingate appointed Henifin to lead the city’s water recovery in 2022. 
Jackson City Attorney Drew Martin criticized JXN Water for not considering sooner its revenue needs. This increase would mark the second rate hike since Henifin took over. The manager previously has said it took a while to realize how much money the system needed to function. 
“What we hear from residents is ‘you can’t just spend money first and assume we can afford it,’” Martin said Thursday. 
In September, the utility ramped up its collection efforts, shutting off about 1,800 accounts. JXN Water has disconnected 4,403 total accounts since the start of 2025, adding it plans to continue disconnecting 500 to 1,000 accounts per week. It did not say how many accounts have since caught up or have been reconnected. The utility said it plans to have “worked” all accounts by mid-2026. 
In a court filing last week, Nelson submitted letters from constituents with thousands of dollars in water debt. After not receiving a bill for the first time in years, they couldn’t afford the down payment JXN Water requires to keep their taps on, the letters said. 
For others who wrote in, the utility told them they had high charges because of a leak at their home, although some claimed to have hired plumbers who told them the opposite. Some constituents complained of rude representatives from the JXN Water call center. 
Wingate himself said he called the center as an experiment and got conflicting answers from different operators. Henifin admitted Thursday the utility needs to better train its operators, which he said would begin around the new year.
A letter about billing issues a JXN Water customer sent to Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat from Byram.
 “JXN Water has forgotten about the people and the citizens,” Nelson told the court while also praising the progress Henifin’s team has made so far.
The utility initially planned to send a notice of the rate increase to customers on Nov. 15 and for the change to take effect Dec. 15. In Wingate’s 2022 order that put Henifin in charge, the language doesn’t say the manager needs the court’s approval to implement a rate increase.
But at the eleventh hour of Thursday’s conference, Wingate enjoined, or stopped, Henifin from moving forward. JXN Water attorneys said they would need a decision by the end of November to enact the rate hike by the end of 2025, leading to the judge setting the next conference for Nov. 19. 
The two-day hearing, which began last week, looked in-depth at a number of issues, including both the city and JXN Water alleging the other owes it money.

‘More than frustrating’
Henifin on Thursday discussed the city’s water debt, which as of October was $6.9 million. Most of that is from leaks at the Jackson Zoo, which should be fixed in the next two to three weeks, Jackson’s chief administrative officer Pieter Teeuwissen said.
But in the meantime, Henifin said, JXN Water has held “hostage” $6.3 million the utility owes the city in sanitation fees. Because residents pay for garbage pickup in the water bill, that money first goes to JXN Water. 
Wingate questioned the utility chief about withholding those funds. Henifin said JXN Water has spent the money to help keep its daily operations afloat. When the judge asked Henifin what authority allowed that power, he admitted he had “none.” The manager said the utility will pay back the city once Jackson pays its water debt. 
Teeuwissen and other city officials criticized JXN Water, saying not having sanitation revenue puts a strain on Jackson’s budget. Martin, the city attorney, said “it is more than frustrating” to hear Henifin withheld the funds without any authority.

JXN Water’s books and help from the Legislature
Horhn reaffirmed his stance Thursday against the proposed rate increase. The mayor is hopeful the state Legislature will work with him in the 2026 session to find other streams of revenue to invest into the water and sewer systems, and said it’s premature to raise rates before seeing what that may look like. 
Horhn offered several suggestions to lawmakers in October, such as raising the sales tax or diverting funds from the Capitol Complex Improvement District.
City officials also appealed to Wingate to allow access to JXN Water’s financial records, stating they couldn’t agree to a rate increase without having that information. 
While Henifin last week agreed to do so, he later asked to condition that access to prevent records from becoming public. Without context, he argued, it’d be easy for someone to misinterpret the numbers. The 2022 order gave Henifin the power to run the utility without being subject to public record laws. 
After initially pushing back on the conditions, the city said it would agree to a protection order preventing the records from becoming public without Henifin’s approval.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06124621/Jackson-Water2-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-14 14:57:51.767846

The caucus elected Rep. Joshua Watkins, who began his first term in the legislature earlier this year, during the lawmakers’ annual conference in Berea, a press release said. He succeeds Rep. Lindsey Burke, of Lexington. 
Burke became the Democratic caucus chair after former chair Louisville Rep. Al Gentry stepped down earlier this week to pursue an adaptive golf project. 
In a statement, House Democratic Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, praised the skills Burke and Watkins bring to their new roles.

“Rep. Burke boosts our caucus with experience, expertise, and a fierce commitment to helping families trying to build a good life,” Stevenson said. “And Rep. Watkins can always be counted on for bringing energy, optimism, and a joy to serving others that lifts everyone around him. We’re all excited to move forward together and keep doing what Kentuckians expect of us: fighting for fairness, opportunity, and dignity for every person in this Commonwealth.”
The changes in the House Democrats’ leadership come as Stevenson is running a statewide campaign for U.S. Senate. 
Burke said in the press release that she is honored to have her new leadership position. 
“Our work is about helping people meet their everyday needs,” Burke said. “Families need affordable homes, quality education, accessible health care, and the ability to put food on the table without constant worry. Those are the issues Kentuckians are talking about with us every day.”
Watkins, who during a forum this week encouraged legislators to focus on addressing housing needs in the upcoming session, said in the press release that he is eager to serve in caucus leadership. 
“We have an opportunity to make life better for people who are too often overlooked,” Watkins said. “That means listening, learning, and doing the hard work to give everyone a fair shot at a better future. We’re at a crucial moment, and we’re meeting it with determination to make our government and our economy work for every Kentuckian.”

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Following budget crises at several of its schools, the University of Louisiana System is studying how to restructure to minimize costs and maximize oversight. 
The system’s governing board voted Thursday to create a task force made up of university administrators, faculty, students and athletics officials from each of its nine universities. The group will look at ways to create shared services across the universities, implement a cross-system course numbering system and create long-term financial stability for college athletics. 
University of Louisiana System President Rick Gallot said he has been considering this plan since he took the job in 2023. 
The restructure is intended to give the system more power to deal with financial problems at its schools. In the past two years, the University of New Orleans and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have had to dig themselves out of budget shortfalls, totalling $30 million and $25, respectively, that led to faculty and staff furloughs and layoffs. 
The University of Louisiana at Monroe has also had to deal with a $12 million budget shortfall but chose not to furlough any of its employees. 
Every university in the UL System is running a deficit in athletics, which are contributing significantly to the budget crunch at some schools. 
These fiscal problems largely snuck up on the system and its board members. 
“UNO was my alma mater, and I was on the board of supervisors, and somehow we didn’t know all that had gone wrong at UNO,” UL board member Julie Stokes said. 
In response to the budget crisis at UNO, the state legislature approved moving the school back to the LSU System, which it had been a part of until 2011. The switch is expected to take place in July. 
“I would say the same thing is true here, that the system by which we are managing these schools is not providing us adequate ability to supervise what’s happening at these schools,” Stokes said of ULL, which hosted Thursday’s meeting. 
Though it’s not yet known what actions the board will end up taking after receiving the task force report, if it decides to streamline services, such as human resources, accounting and IT, it is possible some people will lose their jobs. 
But Gallot encouraged those affected by any restructuring to participate in the study phase. The system will hold town halls about the process at each system university and put up a website to receive feedback, he said. 
The LSU System also announced its intent to restructure this month, although its process is very different. 
While the UL System will be going through a public process, LSU announced a rough outline of its new structure on Nov. 4, when it also hired a new president and chancellor, and said it would vote to finalize the plan within 30 days, without getting input from the public.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-11-14 18:05:51+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Horizon to pay NJ $100M to resolve claims it overcharged the state,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/14/horizon-settlement-new-jersey/,The insurer entered a settlement with New Jersey to resolve claims it ignored a cost-saving provision in its contract with the state.,"Attorney General Matt Platkin said Horizon drove up the cost of health care for state workers by overcharging the state, a claim the company disputes. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield agreed to pay New Jersey $100 million as part of a settlement to resolve claims that it made false statements to win a contract managing the state’s public worker health plans and then ignored a contractual provision so it could overcharge the public plans, prosecutors announced Friday. 
State officials say Horizon, which administers public plans that insure more than 750,000 state and local government workers and retirees, had ignored a provision in the 2020 contract that required it to charge the state the amount billed by a health care provider or an amount negotiated between the provider and Horizon, whichever is less.
But the insurer knew it could not comply with the provision before it bid into the contract and concealed that fact from state procurement officials, the Office of the Attorney General alleged. Then it ignored the provisions, submitting more than 1,000 false claims to the state alongside fraudulent records to support them, according to state prosecutors.
“At a time when everyone is rightly concerned about the cost of their health care, it is simply unacceptable that an insurance company would seek to defraud our State and overcharge us while driving up the costs of health care for hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement Friday.
The state said Friday the settlement is the largest non-Medicaid false claims settlement amount in state history. Horizon denies any wrongdoing, and the settlement does not include an admission of guilt.
The lesser-of provision was a new addition to the 2020 third-party administrator contract meant to reduce costs for the state’s public worker health plans, which are distressed following successive premium hikes and departures by local governments and schools.
The provision required Horizon to charge the state the amount billed by a provider or the amount negotiated between the provider and Horizon ahead of time, whichever was less. For example, if a doctor charged $300 for a visit but had negotiated a $600 cost with the insurer, the provision would bar Horizon from charging the state more than $300.
But the insurer ignored the requirement and even sent plan members documents that misstated the amount it charged the state for their health care, providing lower provider charges even when higher negotiated amounts were paid, prosecutors said in their lawsuit.
Horizon received nearly $500 million across nearly five years under that contract, state officials said. Along with Aetna, the insurer was chosen to act as a third-party administrator for the state plans in contracts awarded last year.
The firm has since begun complying with the lesser-of provision and ceased providing false documents to members, according to the settlement agreement.
A spokesperson for Horizon said Platkin mischaracterized the facts.
“This has never been anything more than a straightforward contract dispute, one that Horizon tried to resolve in good faith more than four years ago in the same way it has resolved similar disagreements over the course of our long and fruitful partnership with the State: through a negotiated reimbursement,” said Thomas Wilson, the spokesperson.
Horizon resolved the underlying issues in 2023, he said, and the payments in question accounted for just 0.07% of claims and less than 0.5% of the amounts paid to health care providers.
“While Horizon’s interpretation of one aspect of the contract differed from the State’s, the settlement makes clear Horizon never retained any portion of monies charged to the State for health care provider claims,” Wilson said. “Horizon paid claims we processed for the State according to the contracts in place with the doctors and hospitals filing those claims.”
In the settlement, Horizon denies overbilling or submitting false documents to the state, positions not shared by New Jersey or private individuals who initially lodged the suit.
The suit against the insurer was initially brought by a group of private individuals, called relators, who sued on behalf of the state under the New Jersey False Claims Act. That law imposes civil penalties on individuals or firms who knowingly make false claims for payments from the state.
The law allows private citizens to sue on the government’s behalf and keep a portion of the proceeds if the suit succeeds.
Five of the six relators who brought the suit will split $12 million from the settlement. They are former State Policemen’s Benevolent Association Executive Director Kevin Lyons, former state PBA President Pat Colligan, former PBA Executive Vice President Marc Kovar, and Mark and Vince Flores, co-founders of the health benefits consulting firm AVYM.
A sixth relator, former state assistant director of health benefits Christin Deacon, will not receive a share of the proceeds because she administered the 2020 contract and became aware of the insurer’s alleged conduct in the course of her work before leaving her position.
“The Division has been, and continues to be, laser-focused on enforcing its contracts and ensuring that our health benefits plans and our members are protected,” state Treasurer Liz Muoio said in a statement.
Of the remaining proceeds, $10 million will go to the state’s false claims prosecution fund — state law requires 10% of proceeds from false claims settlements to be deposited there — and the remaining $78 million will return to the state pension and benefits division.
As part of the settlement agreement, Horizon will submit to additional reporting of its claims data and finances, including daily access to its claims, quarterly reviews, and more fulsome monthly reporting.
The insurer is required to make the $100 million payment by Dec. 2. It must also pay $1.25 million in attorney fees to the relators and unspecified amounts to the state for the enforcement of the agreement.

(Illustration by Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)I root for the underdog.
Maybe you’re like me, urging a touchdown from a winless team or hoping for a goal from a cash-strapped squad. Sure, FanDuel says they will lose by six touchdowns — and that’s exactly why I’m cheering for them. I’m a sucker for it all: “Hoosiers” and Leicester City and the Miracle on Ice. 
To identify the underdogs, we create power rankings for baseball seasons that are months away, coaches’ polls in college football and even national rankings in high school soccer. On betting apps, we find underdogs through point spreads and win probabilities. 
All of that energy highlights the folly of prediction — attempting to compare teams that will never be in the same state, let alone the same tournament. “Who would win a lacrosse match between these two undefeated high school teams: one from Virginia and one from Texas?”
Nevertheless, see me there on the couch, fixated on the national rankings, pulling for the underdog and begging for a fourth quarter interception so that a team designated No. 19 will beat No. 18. What an inspiring story.
High school sports fuel my upset fever. I have been on the sidelines for countless games, camera in hand as a photojournalist, when plucky rural schools have spooked state-ranked all-star squads. It’s electric. 
In search of Cinderella in Kansas high school sports, I scoured this fall’s online playoff results for the Kansas State High School Activities Association. After charting more than 100 games and more than a dozen brackets, I’m still looking. 
This fall has been a blockbuster season for the favorites in Kansas high school sports, so far. In the three fall sports where KSHSAA provides seedings — girls tennis, boys soccer and football — the top-ranked teams are dominating in 2025. 
Let’s start with football, because … well, America demands it. 
For football, KSHSAA organizes the state brackets into east and west. There are 16 teams in each bracket for Class 1A through 6A. With two rounds complete, that means there have been 96 games in those classes so far. (I didn’t tabulate eight-player and six-player formats, since they use different seeding systems.)
In the first round, the top eight football seeds had 81 victories and 15 losses, winning almost 85 percent of games. More than half of the wins by lower-seeded teams were by No. 9 seeds beating No. 8 seeds — not the dramatic upset I wanted.
In the second round of the football playoffs, seeds No. 1 through 8 won 44 games. The bottom eight seeds? They won just four times. 
All 12 football No. 1 seeds from 1A to 6A have survived the first two rounds. For us underdog fans, we must search to find the scattered low seeds. 
If you think you’ve found an underdog in the 4A football bracket — the No. 13 seed — you will need to look closer. This low seed, Bishop Miege High School, is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. They have mauled their first two opponents, 57-7 in round one and 30-6 in round two. 
How did they earn such a low seed? A team’s winning percentage is the basis for KSHSAA football seedings. For Bishop Miege, that stat is misleading, the result of a challenging schedule filled with match-ups against larger schools, both from Kansas and Missouri. Sure, they lost often, but against 6A Blue Valley North and Rockhurst High School, the fifth best team in Kansas City. 
This is not a typical 3-5 football team. 
Miege often plays the postseason spoiler, frequently in the state basketball playoffs. The school draws a low seed after a handful of regular-season losses, and then they tear through playoff opponents with better seeds. It’s particularly cruel when Miege is underrated and they pick off a No. 1 seed in an early round, never to be challenged again on their run to a state championship.
If football can’t provide an underdog story, then what about Kansas high school soccer? 
Alas, the top eight seeds in KSHSAA soccer this year won even more often than the favorites in football, an almost 88% winning rate in the first two rounds. 
Only two teams seeded in the bottom eight escaped the second round. Both of them — No. 9 St. Thomas Aquinas and No. 11 Kansas City’s Piper — mimicked the resume of Bishop Miege in football. They hug the state line with Missouri and played punishing regular seasons in the metro area — a record that sunk their seedings. In the playoffs, they started strong. 
While not a low seed, No. 5 Shawnee Mission East made an even deeper run to the state final in Class 6A soccer with a similar formula. 
It’s stunning that KSHSAA’s seeding would be so reliable in predicting winners, particularly soccer. Scoring is lower in soccer, with far fewer goals in the sport than touchdowns in football or baskets in basketball. That leads to less-predictable outcomes in most soccer leagues. But in the Kansas high school soccer playoffs, the favorites kept winning. 
That leaves us with tennis, but I’m warning you. Shield your eyes, my fellow underdog softies. 
In four classifications this year, KSHSAA awarded both a singles championship and a doubles championship. That’s eight total champions. The No. 1 seed won seven of the eight brackets. 
The only “upset” was in 3A doubles, where the No. 2 seed Reygan Coonrod and Inarie Rippert of Ellsworth beat the No. 1 seed. 
Even the tennis semifinals were parades for the top seeds. The No. 1, 2 and 3 seeds in all eight tournaments advanced to the semis. In fact, the lowest seed to advance to the semis was No. 5 seed — hardly an underdog in a bracket that contained 24 competitors. 
This is a good time to admit this: When I started my KSHSAA research, I thought I would be writing about how inefficient the seeding systems were. How they fed all kinds of upsets because they relied strictly on winning percentage, as in football and soccer. I had my ire poised for the keyboard. 
Instead, it’s kudos to you, KSHSAA. With only a few Kansas schools providing upsets, your seeding was nearly undefeated.

November 2020 | Ken Coleman photoLet’s be blunt: Michigan Republicans, like their counterparts nationally, are no longer merely questioning elections. They are actively seeking to undermine them. 
Their latest maneuvers, calling for federal intervention by baselessly smearing Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s ability to fairly oversee elections to cheering President Donald Trump’s pardons of the state’s alleged false electors, reveal a party more invested in manufacturing distrust than in protecting democracy.
Put together, these moves are not isolated issues. They form a strategy: cast doubt, sow suspicion, and demand federal oversight, all the while shifting focus from governance to grievance.
The “conflict of interest” gambit
On Thursday, GOP leaders in the Michigan Legislature demanded that the U.S. Department of Justice step in and monitor the state’s 2026 elections because Benson might have a personal political stake — she’s running for governor — and therefore cannot be trusted to run elections impartially. 
But those who know how our elections work also know Michigan has a deeply decentralized system administered across 1,600+ local jurisdictions and that electoral oversight is routinely conducted with bipartisan monitors and observers. 
What’s happening here is not about transparency, it’s about casting suspicion.

Rather than offering credible evidence of wrongdoing, these Republicans are demanding a federal takeover of state elections under the guise of “protecting fairness.” 
That is opposite the principle of local control and further erodes public confidence. 
The optics of a state handing over election control to Washington, D.C., are antithetical to stated conservative principles valuing states’ rights over those not explicitly delineated to the federal government. 
The pardons of false electors
Furthering this attempt to undermine elections were the October pardons by Trump of 16 Michigan Republicans who allegedly signed on as a false slate of electors in 2020 in an effort to overturn the certified election results in the state. 
The pardons, which were wholly unnecessary after the charges were dismissed, undercuts faith in the very system Republicans insist they are defending.
It is breathtakingly hypocritical. 
Keep in mind that the Republicans charged in the false elector case were not exonerated. After having sat through hours of testimony in the case, it was clear to me that the evidence showed an attempt to try and overturn Joe Biden’s Electoral College win. 
But a poorly handled investigation and an overreaching prosecution ultimately left the judge little choice but to reject the charges.
When you pardon those who seemingly tried to subvert the system and were already cleared of any consequences, how do you then credibly say you’re working to protect the system?

Why this matters
The integrity of elections is built by process, by transparency, and by predictable rules. In that regard, Michigan is among the best, having been ranked second in the nation for election administration in 2024 by the Elections Performance Index. 
Released by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, the report scored Michigan at 88% on the index, second only to New Mexico, which also scored 88%. The report noted Michigan had shorter wait times for voters, far fewer registration and absentee ballot issues than the national average and a much lower rate of unreturned mail ballots. Michigan was also higher than the national average in both voter turnout (59.3% compared to 47.5% nationally) and voter registration (91% compared to 84% nationally). 
Yet now, Republicans lawmakers seem fixated not on improving how we vote but on how they can discredit how we vote.
When political actors sow doubt in elections without credible evidence, they are not engaging in oversight — they are delegitimizing democracy. 
When they then demand federal intervention in a state process because they don’t like the referee, they are undermining the system of state-run elections that the U.S. Constitution guarantees.
State Republicans’ relentless refusal to accept the basic legitimacy of our voting system aren’t signs of vigilance; they’re warnings. 
If we continue down a path where power matters more than truth and sabotage masquerades as oversight, then the greatest threat to Michigan’s elections won’t come from foreign actors or technical glitches — it will come from those who claim to defend democracy while dismantling it from within.

Kyle Walker listens during a 2025 committee hearing. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican state Sen. Kyle Walker has announced his opposition to redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps despite his close ties with a leader of a pro-redistricting group.
Walker’s statement, which he first released Thursday, makes him the eighth Senate Republican to publicly come out against the push initiated by President Donald Trump for redistricting in Indiana and other GOP-led states.
“I’ve spent the past several months listening closely to my constituents on mid-decade redistricting,” Walker said. “With 93 percent opposed, and as their voice in the Indiana Senate, I’ll be voting no.”
Thirteen Republican senators have come out in support, but 19 of the 40-member caucus haven’t made their stances known publicly.


The following GOP senators have come out in support of redistricting:
Sen. Scott AlexanderSen. Ron AltingSen. Scott BaldwinSen. Liz BrownSen. Justin BuschSen. Gary ByrneSen. Chris GartenSen. Mike GaskillSen. Tyler JohnsonSen. Eric KochSen. Randy MaxwellSen. Daryl SchmittSen. Andy Zay

Walker is up for reelection next year in one of the state’s few politically close state Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County. He won the 2022 election with 55% of the vote.
Walker’s opposition is notable because he is a member of the 24-person Indiana Republican Party State Committee as the party’s 7th Congressional District vice chair.
He is also executive vice president of MO Strategies, a political consulting firm that is led by Marty Obst.
Obst is the chair of Fair Maps Indiana, a nonprofit group that says it has launched a six-figure advertising effort targeting undecided Republican senators pushing for their support of redistricting. The campaign includes texts, digital, television and mail advertising.
Obst served in senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns and was a senior political adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. 
Walker did not immediately reply Friday to a message from the Indiana Capital Chronicle seeking additional comment on his decision.
Indiana lawmakers are scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters.
Senate Republican leadership has said they do not yet have enough votes to pass a redistricting bill. Any new maps would need a majority of 26 senators or 25 with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith breaking a tie in support.
Other Republican senators who’ve announced opposition to redistricting are: Eric Bassler, Vaneta Becker, Spencer Deery, Sue Glick, Jean Leising, Jim Tomes and Greg Walker. 
Enough House Republicans are believed to be supportive of a redistricting effort for it to win passage in that chamber.
Walker has, at times, broken with other Senate Republicans on prominent legislation.
For instance, he voted earlier this year against Senate Bill 289, which was signed into law prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in state government and public schools. He also voted against the 2022 bill that established the state’s near-total abortion ban.

Vouchers and unaccountable 'choice' schemes threaten ... the many in favor of a few.""","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

When legislators talk about “school choice” and diverting public dollars to private schools, they often package it as empowering parents. But often overlooked in the conversation is that after years of underfunding and unfair criticism, Mississippi’s public education is seeing measurable success.
According to the latest Kids Count Data Book, Mississippi was ranked 16th in the nation for K-12 education. Our fourth graders have led the nation in reading and math gains on the National Assessment of Educational Progress rankings, and graduation rates have reached historic highs.
There are so many wonderful things happening in Mississippi public education. Now is not the time to pull away from a shared system that is working. Vouchers and unaccountable “choice” schemes threaten the progress of the many in favor of a few.

The adage “it takes a village to raise a child” has never been truer. Educators are not seeking to replace parents but to partner with them. Schools consistently plead for parents to be active participants in the educational process.
Public schools are our community’s schools, run by local boards, funded by taxpayers and accountable to the public. Suggesting that only private schools or home options are legitimate undermines our collective investment that ensures every child, regardless of income or zip code, has access to quality education.
Mississippi’s recent gains were not driven by privatization. The state directs a very small percentage of kindergarten–12 funding to private programs. Our progress stems from intentional public investments in early literacy, Pre-K expansion, teacher support, accountability and local district innovations.
Yet, Mississippi has chronically underfunded its schools. Since the Mississippi Adequate Education Program was created in 1997, legislators only fully funded it twice, leaving a cumulative shortfall exceeding $3.3 billion.
Even in 2023, despite revenue surpluses, education was shorted by $161 million. The newly created 2024 Mississippi Student Funding Formula provided roughly $50 million less than full MAEP funding would have delivered.
We cannot afford to carve public money away from schools already asked to do more with less. Each diverted dollar reduces resources for classrooms, support staff, fine arts programs, counselors, nurses and special education.
Who truly benefits — and who loses — when vouchers enter the system? These programs primarily serve affluent families already able to afford private school tuition. They cluster benefits in urban areas, where private schools are more abundant, leaving rural Mississippians with fewer options and underfunded local schools.
When voucher programs win, public-school students and their teachers lose — facing larger class sizes, fewer resources and diminished support in the classrooms where most Mississippi children learn.
Public schools are accountable through testing, audits and transparency. Voucher-funded schools, however, are rarely held to the same standards. Many select their students, exclude those with disabilities or cloak financials in privacy.
Public dollars deserve public oversight. If a school takes tax money, it should be held to the same accountability expectations as every Mississippi public classroom. 
Other states offer clear warnings. In Tennessee, voucher students underperformed compared to their public school peers. In Arkansas, costs ballooned and private schools hiked tuition, excluding low-income families. Louisiana’s choice expansion deepened budget gaps.
Mississippi should learn from these examples: When states funnel public money into private schooling, inequality grows while outcomes stagnate.
Rather than dividing limited resources, Mississippi should double down on what works.
We should:

Fully fund the Mississippi Student Funding Formula so districts can operate reliably.
Expand early literacy and math intervention programs.
Support teacher recruitment, retention and development, particularly in rural areas.
Strengthen support for special education, fine arts education, counseling and technology.
Encourage innovation through magnet programs, dual enrollments and career tech centers within public systems.

Proponents of vouchers call “choice” freedom, but real freedom is not abandoning public responsibility. It is building a society where every child, regardless of income or geography, can attend a great public school.
Mississippi’s progress proves what collective investment can achieve. We should not dismantle progress with policies that favor the few. Public dollars belong in public schools.
The real choice before us is simple: a future where all children succeed, or one where some succeed at the expense of others. That’s a choice we must not accept and must do our due diligence to fight against.

Brown/Florida Phoenix)A Florida Republican has re-filed a measure to penalize local governments attempting to remove or destroy Confederate monuments and other historic memorials.
HB 496 by Sen. Stan McClain, an Ocala Republican, demands the state protect “each historic Florida monument or memorial from removal, damage, or destruction.” It’s the fourth time this bill has been introduced in successive legislative sessions as part of a broader conservative response to the nationwide movement to down or rename Confederate statues.
“The Legislature finds that an accurate and factual history belongs to all Floridians and future generations and that the state has an obligation to protect and preserve such history,” the bill reads.
Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
Local government officials who try to take down the monuments would be fined up to $1,000, and could open themselves to lawsuits by either the group that helped maintain or erect the memorial or any Floridian who regularly uses it for “remembrance purposes.” A court could award the suing party damages up to $100,000.
The push to remove Confederate images emerged in 2015, after white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine Black people in the Mother Emanuel AME Church a in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof had posed multiple times with a Confederate battle flag leading up to the mass shooting. From 2015 to 2018, roughly 110 Confederate memorials were removed nationwide. In addition, the state stopped flying the Confederate flag over the State House.
Hillsborough County was one of the first local governments in Florida to act following that incident, with the county commission voting later that summer to remove a Confederate flag that had hung in its county center, the Phoenix previously reported.
The Florida Legislature voted in 2016 to remove a statue of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith that represented Florida in the U.S. Capitol, and again in 2018 to replace it with a statue of Mary McLeod Bethune, known for starting a private college for African American students in Daytona Beach that would become Bethune-Cookman College.
The removal push was reinvigorated in 2020 after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white police officer; nationally, 168 monuments were nixed that year alone, which eventually sparked the counter-movement to keep the statues seen in Florida.
In 2023, Florida Republicans first attempted to pass the measure to ban historic monuments being removed, damaged, or destroyed. Similar measures were introduced in the 2024 and 2025 sessions, but each failed before reaching either the House or Senate floors. As of 2024, Florida still had 73 of these monuments existing statewide.
Sen. McClain’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The 2026 session begins on Jan. 13.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)An Iowa Department of Natural Resources study on food waste in the state found that Iowans on average, throw away 200 pounds of food each year. 
The study identified a number of ways that households and businesses can reduce their food waste and in turn, help food insecure households, the environment and the economy. 
Preventing food waste by producing, buying and serving only what is needed is the best way, according to the study, to reduce food waste. 
Other methods it identified include donating or upcycling food before it goes bad, feeding it to animals and livestock, composting food scraps or putting them through an anaerobic digestion system and applying the product to the land. 
Some of these solutions, according to the report, can be implemented in the near future while others have a longer start-up time, or require changes in state and local policies.

The food waste problem 
DNR determined in a 2022 study of landfill materials that food waste, comprising unsold food from stores, table scraps, uneaten prepared food, kitchen trimmings and byproducts from food and beverage processing facilities, was the number one material in Iowa landfills. 
The same study found that 19% of landfill material in Iowa is loose or packaged food waste. Of the average 200 pounds of food per year per person that Iowans dispose of at home, 25% is still packaged. When including commercial food waste into the calculation, Iowans dispose of 300 pounds of food waste, per person, per year. 
The Iowa rate is lower than the average rate for the U.S., which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates is between 492 to 1,032 pounds per person per year. 
EPA also estimates the average family throws away about $3,000 worth of food, or 11% of household food expenditures, annually. 
Further, the study said food waste emits air pollutants as it sits in solid waste landfills. 
Suggested solutions
The best way to reduce food waste that ends up in landfills is to manage the amount of waste in homes and businesses. 
The study suggests that at home, residents: eat their leftovers, keep track of the items in their refrigerators and pantries, plan meals, be creative with meals to use what is about to spoil, store food properly and purchase in quantities that can be consumed before they spoil. 
Restaurants can audit their waste streams and adjust their menus, wholesale orders and portion sizes to reduce food waste.

The study points out that while households and commercial businesses throw out food, 1 in 8 Iowans face food insecurity. 
Food banks and food pantries often receive donations from grocery stores or wholesalers of food that is about to pass its expiration date, which can be one way of  reducing food waste. 
The study surveyed six food-rescue organizations in Iowa, including Food Bank of Iowa, which accepted more 26 million pounds of rescue food in 2023 to be distributed across its 55-county region. 
The surveyed organizations identified that the majority of this food is able to be used and given out at food pantries, though the process presents some barriers. It’s difficult to always provide culturally relevant foods and some stores are reluctant to donate their food for fear of being held liable for accidentally donating spoiled food. 
Based on the information gleaned from the study, DNR recommends the state improve education and training strategies around food donation, establish requirements for certain businesses to donate food and increase tax credits available for donating food.  
Composting is another strategy for reducing food waste.
The study found that in 2024, approximately 2,925 tons of food waste were managed with composting in Iowa. 
This means, per the study, that most facilities are operating “well below” permitted limits and that the state’s composting capacity is “not being fully utilized.” 
Surveyed facilities cited permitting, contamination due to the inclusion of non-compostable items like glass or plastic, and cost as the major limiting factors to increasing compost capacity.
Solutions presented by the study include: legislative requirements to compost food for certain businesses, partnerships to purchase or rent composting equipment, grants and incentives to pre-process food waste. 
Once food scraps are composted, the study found that waste facilities generally do not have a hard time selling the compost to homeowners, businesses and farmers that want to apply the nutrient-rich product to their fields and gardens. 
Similar to composting, anaerobic digestion also breaks down food scraps into a usable product: biogas. 
According to the study, some Water Resource Recovery Facilities in Iowa pull organic material from wastewater streams and process it via anaerobic digestion. Of the nine sites surveyed by the study, four use the produced biogas onsite for things like heating boilers and electricity generation, while others sold the biogas. 
The study suggests greater development, marketing and procurement of the practice at facilities in the state to help manage food waste. 
The study points out that composting facilities and wastewater facilities with anaerobic digestion are concentrated to areas of higher population in the state, which means some regions don’t have access to these processes. There are only five composting facilities in Iowa and three water resource recovery facilities that accept food waste.
DNR noted that residents and businesses can add smaller compost or anaerobic digestion infrastructure on site or in their backyards to help reduce food waste that ends up in a landfill.
Another solution the study suggested is the implementation of a “sharing table” at schools. This practice has been implemented in other states and allows students to put their un-opened packaged food on a table in the cafeteria to be donated, rather than tossing it in the garbage.
The study also called for greater education in schools around food waste, and incentives to businesses that implement food reduction efforts. 
DNR said it plans to continue to measure food waste in Iowa to “to assess effectiveness of the State’s efforts to reduce food waste.”
The study was funded through an EPA Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant.

Drinking rates in the U.S. in 2025 are at their lowest point since 1958, according to a Gallup poll.
The report says that from 1997 to 2023, at least 60% of Americans reported drinking alcohol at least occasionally. That number is now 54%.
Pollsters say it coincides with research highlighting health risks with any level of drinking, in contrast with earlier studies that found health benefits with moderate drinking.
Gallup has been tracking Americans’ drinking habits annually since 1939, and the drinking rate has only been under 60% eight times.
This shift in drinking habits is mainly being seen among younger generations. In 2001, 72% of young adults aged 18 to 34 reported drinking alcohol. That number is now at 50%.
Other demographics that have shown the highest decline include: Republicans, households making less than $40,000 or more than $100,000, white adults and women.

(Photo by Getty Images)A third lawsuit has been filed against Iowa’s insurance commissioner over the legality of a new state law regulating pharmacy benefit managers.
A group of insurance companies argue Senate File 383, signed into law earlier this year, “upends the prescription-drug coverage that Iowans receive and prevents health-benefit plans from communicating cost-saving information about one pharmacy over another.” The lawsuit claims federal law preempts that sort of “interference,” and the First Amendment prohibits the law’s restrictions on free speech.
The lawsuit was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa by OptumRx, a pharmacy benefit manager headquartered in Minnesota, and by several insurance providers or health plan administrators with which it contracts: United HealthCare Services, UMR Inc., UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company, UnitedHealthcare Plan of the River Valley, and Golden Rule Insurance Company.

Two previous lawsuits challenging the legality of Senate File 383 have already paused enforcement of parts of the law.
In July, Chief U.S. District Judge Stephanie Rose concluded that significant portions of the new law are most likely illegal and invalid and preliminarily enjoined the law’s enforcement against the plaintiffs in that particular case – the Iowa Association of Business and Industry.
In October, Rose blocked the law’s enforcement in a separate but similar case brought by Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield, Iowa’s largest health insurer. In that case, Rose issued a temporary injunction pausing the imposition of a $10.68 dispensing fee for prescriptions filled at pharmacies in Iowa under Wellmark covered plans and policies.
The new law restricts PBMs’ ability to set certain cost-sharing rates and fees intended to incentivize a person to fill their prescription at a particular pharmacy. The law also requires independent pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average national acquisition cost of a drug plus a $10.68 dispensing fee.
The law is backed by the owners of many small and rural pharmacies, but is opposed by some business leaders and health insurance companies who argue that while it provides more money for small pharmacies it does so at the expense of Iowa consumers.

ABI has warned the measure could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans, resulting in an increase of $169 for the average insured Iowans’ pharmaceutical costs each year.
Iowa’s insurance commissioner, Doug Ommen, has appealed the injunction issued in the ABI case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and ABI has filed a cross-appeal. Both appeals are still pending.
New lawsuit cites decision in ABI case
In the newly filed lawsuit brought by OptumRx and its business partners, the plaintiffs allege Senate File 383 adds “far-reaching, draconian and expensive new measures” to Iowa law, and they are seeking an injunction halting enforcement of the new law. They also argue the new law is preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Citing the district court’s reasoning in the ABI case, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit argue that Ommen cannot legitimately enforce Senate File 383 against the many entities who aren’t parties to the ABI lawsuit.
They note that shortly after the injunction was issued in the ABI case, the commissioner opted to forgo enforcement of the new law against OptumRx, UHS, UMR, UHIC, UHC River Valley and Golden Rule. “But the situation has changed,” the lawsuit states, alleging that on Sept. 24, 2025, the commissioner issued a bulletin to all pharmacy benefit managers announcing his intent to enforce the law against all entities that were not part of ABI’s case, asserting he was “obligated” to do so.
“Senate File 383 financially harms not just the plaintiffs but also the Iowans that they serve,” the lawsuit claims. “Further, the commissioner’s enforcement of SF 383 wastes resources, carries potential monetary penalties, and risks plaintiffs’ licensure in the State of Iowa.”
The lawsuit seeks, “at a minimum,” the same injunctive relief already afforded to the parties in the ABI case.

The board Thursday approved changes to requirements for directors in the Child Nutrition Program. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education Thursday approved changes to the requirements for hiring directors for the state’s Child Nutrition Program.
The changes would require candidates to have a high school diploma; three years of food service management experience, state approved training and a level four certificate from the School Nutrition Association.
Previously, a child nutrition program director had to have a bachelor’s degree in food and nutrition, food service management, or home economics; a minimum of 1,400 hours in compensated food management or an approved alternative, and 15 hours of professional development.
According to State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey, the previous requirements were set by the federal government. That led to criticisms from state school districts, especially rural ones.
“For many years, going back before I was in this role, in my last role, we had complaints about the rules being so strict that we in many of our school districts, especially rural counties, could not find people who met the qualifications,” Mackey said. “Qualifications were set by the US Department of Agriculture, so we couldn’t do anything about that. But in 2025 the agriculture department really relaxed their rules and gave states more flexibility, and our board immediately picked that up.”
Mackey said the changes would “allow more people to be able to join our child nutrition management team.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0243-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-14 12:57:07.875626

The Detroit Public School Community District School Board this week unanimously voted to adopt a resolution endorsing the Invest in MI Kids Ballot proposal, which seeks to add a 5% surcharge on state income taxes over the constitutional flat tax rate of 4.25% for individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million.
Proponents say it would raise over $1 billion in funding for Michigan schools through what they call a “fair share surcharge” affecting less than 1% of the wealthiest filers in Michigan.
“When we invest in Michigan’s kids, we’re investing in Detroit’s future. Every dollar spent on our students strengthens our neighborhoods, our economy, and our city.

Credit: Related DigitalRyan Friedrichs, a vice president for the company pushing the controversial AI data center project in Saline Township, and the husband of Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, would recuse himself from any projects before the state if Benson is elected governor in 2026.
That said, the company stopped short of saying that Friedrichs would leave his post at the company, which is owned by one of Benson’s larger donors. Whether Friedrichs stepping down or stepping away from the company would resolve the conflict remains an open question for the state’s voters in the August 2026 primary, or the general election should Benson move on to the fall contest.
Questions about a potential conflict of interest between Friedrichs, Benson and Related Companies, the parent corporation of Related Digital, which is developing the data center, came to the fore after Michigan Advance and others reported that the secretary of state’s husband held a high-ranking position in the company and was involved in its past lobbying work.
Michigan’s Benson has familial, professional ties to company pushing data center project in Saline

Benson is one of the leading contenders in the gubernatorial race, and not just on the Democratic primary side. Friedrichs recently terminated his lobbying license as Benson geared up to run for governor.
Still, the connection raised concerns about whether Benson could be impartial and free from influence given that Related Digital has such a large business interest before the state. The matter not only concerned her husband, but also one of her billionaire donors and professional connections: Stephen Ross, the owner of Related Companies.
The Advance asked Related Companies on Wednesday whether Friedrichs would step down from his position in the company if Benson were to win the August 2026 primary, secure the Democratic Party nomination and eventually go on to win the general election in the fall.
A company spokesperson said that they would respond to the inquiry but did not do so on Wednesday evening.
Benson’s campaign indicated to the Advance on Thursday morning that Friedrichs would indeed step aside from any state business the company might have if the secretary of state ascended to the highest seat in Michigan government next year.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Thursday afternoon, Kathleen Anne Corless, vice president of Corporate Communications for Related Companies, confirmed that Friedrichs would do so if Benson was elected governor.
“This is the largest economic investment in Michigan’s history – Ryan has been a valued member of our team working on community and stakeholder engagement,” Corless said via email. “Our plan is to begin full construction at the end of this year, and regardless of who wins the governor’s race and is sworn in come January 2027, we are not aware of any aspects of the project that would then be before the new administration for consideration.”
Corless went on to say that Related Companies has “strict conflict of interest policies,” and “of course Ryan would then recuse himself from any projects before the state.”
The project is also prohibited from future expansion, making a conflict of interest less likely. But even with Friedrichs out of the picture, any future state business involving Ross’ Related Companies during a potential Benson governorship could still raise conflict of interest questions.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire Republicans are again trying to eliminate a series of programs across state government they consider to be part of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
During the last legislative session, lawmakers debated eliminating the state’s Office of Health Equity and the Department of Environmental Services’ civil rights and environmental justice programs, as well as forbidding the governor from ever re-creating the now-disbanded Governor’s Advisory Council on Diversity and Inclusion. That bill failed, but as a compromise lawmakers renamed the Office of Health Equity to the Office of Health Access in the budget legislation. Additionally, lawmakers enacted a ban on state agencies engaging in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
2025’s bill was spearheaded by Republicans like Rep. Mike Belcher, who called diversity programs “evil” and said at the time they “ought to be considered unlawful and unconstitutional.” However, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, where the Office of Health Access (then the Office of Health Equity) is housed, said the offices are merely meant to allow people with disabilities, people learning to speak English, or others to access state services they’re legally entitled to. Many Republicans argued this isn’t actually DEI, while Democrats said the work was important regardless of whether it was DEI.
In addition to helping blind, deaf, or English language learners obtain state services, the Office of Health Access operates the federally funded refugee resettlement program — which helps new Americans find employment, health care, and social services — and community engagement efforts to understand what health barriers exist in the state. The Department of Environmental Services’ civil rights and environmental justice programs work to ensure the department is in compliance with federal laws like the 1965 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. The Governor’s Advisory Council on Diversity and Inclusion was disbanded during the transition from former Gov. Chris Sununu to current Gov. Kelly Ayotte after her November 2024 election victory. Ayotte told the Bulletin in February she had no plans to resurrect it.
Rep. Yury Polozov, a Hooksett Republican, introduced the same bill ahead of the 2026 session. Polozov said during Wednesday’s House Health and Human Services Committee meeting that the state’s ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs might make parts of the bill unnecessary, “but the underlying message and underlying intention of this bill is crucial for our state.” He said he believes there’s a group of legislators willing to work on floor amendments to adjust the bill.
Health and Human Services Associate Commissioner Ann Landry said if the bill went into effect as written, the department would simply move the functions of the eliminated offices to other offices because they’re required by federal law.
“All the functions have to remain for us to be successful at DHHS,” Landry said, “Either because we’re federally required or required by state law, or it’s a really important part of our engagement with the rural communities and actually all communities across the state.”
John Williams, director of legislative affairs for the department, told lawmakers that 2025’s bill was one in “a very small percent of bills” that the department “actually actively opposed.” He said it was similarly opposed to the bill passing in 2026.
Rep. Mark McLean, a Manchester Republican, called the bill “problematic” but said he was going to vote for it “out of respect” for Polozov. He said if it isn’t amended before a floor vote, he will vote against it there.
Rep. Lucy Weber, a Walpole Democrat, said, “It makes no sense to me to vote yes on a bill that we all agree is fundamentally flawed.”
“I would prefer an ITL (inexpedient to legislate) motion,” she said ahead of her no vote. “If somebody thinks they can fix the bill between now and the time we meet, the remedy would be to vote ITL on the bill as it stands, but bring an amendment that could be considered on the floor.”
The committee voted 9-8 to recommend the entire House pass the bill.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/healthaccess-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Stock photo via Getty Images)In South Carolina, a nurse practitioner’s level of autonomy depends not on training or competence, but on where they work.
At the Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic where I practice, I can deliver autonomous care. Four years ago, when I worked in private practice, that same level of care required a written practice agreement with a collaborating physician.
The South Carolina Nurse Practice Act was amended in 2018 to replace the term “supervising” with “collaborating” physician, an important but limited step toward modernizing nurse practitioner regulation.
There were also changes to where nurse practitioners could practice in relation to the collaborating physicians and some changes in prescriptive authority. The state still requires formal practice agreements that restrict nurse practitioners from working to the full extent of their education and licensure.
In contrast, in 2016 the Veterans Health Administration granted full practice authority to nurse practitioners nationwide. This policy was designed to increase access to care, improve efficiency, and address provider shortages.
Within the Veterans Affairs system, I provide care independently while collaborating naturally with physicians, pharmacists, and mental health professionals as part of a multidisciplinary team.
Collaboration occurs because it benefits patients, not because it is required by regulation.
Nurse practitioners are not seeking to replace physicians but to complement them within the health care system. My own professional path included 16 years as a registered nurse before becoming a nurse practitioner.
While new graduates benefit from supervision and mentorship, long-term restrictions do not enhance safety. Instead, they create unnecessary administrative barriers and delay patient care.
According to the Commonwealth Fund’s 2023 State Health System Performance Scorecard, South Carolina ranked 37th nationally for overall health system performance, based on access, quality, and efficiency.
Research consistently shows that states granting full practice authority to nurse practitioners perform better on these same measures. Expanding practice authority allows for more efficient use of the health care workforce, particularly in rural and underserved communities.
Granting nurse practitioners full practice authority would not drastically change daily practice for most providers. It would simply streamline administrative requirements.
Removing the need for a collaborating physician’s name on nurse practitioner licenses and allowing independent prescribing of certain medications would save time for both nurse practitioners and physicians, allowing all providers to focus more on patient care.
South Carolina faces the same workforce and access challenges as many states, with growing health care demands and a shortage of primary care physicians.
Allowing nurse practitioners to practice to the full scope of their licensure is a proven strategy to expand access, maintain quality, and improve health outcomes.
Modernizing these regulations is not about changing who provides care, it’s about ensuring South Carolinians can receive the care they need, when and where they need it.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nurse-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s second attempt to grow its offshore wind portfolio is dead in the water.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, confirmed in an email to Rhode Island Current Friday morning that the company ended its negotiations with SouthCoast Wind to purchase power from the project. 
The news comes more than a year after Rhode Island officials unveiled a tentative contract with SouthCoast Wind developers to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from the project planned south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket. Negotiations finalizing the deal stalled multiple times due to a series of setbacks by the Trump administration, including revocation of a key federal permit for the project.
Dalo cited the federal uncertainty facing the offshore wind industry as reason for the cutoff of contract negotiations.
“After several [power purchase agreement] negotiation extensions and continued uncertainty in the offshore wind industry, we were unable to come to agreeable terms” Dalo said in his email. “We remain fully supportive of the offshore wind industry and look forward to future clean energy [sic] opportunities as the industry evolves.”
 He did not immediately respond to follow-up questions including when the deal was officially cast aside. The latest deadline, Nov. 1, came and went with no public acknowledgement from either party on the status of the talks.
SouthCoast Wind also did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday. 
The 149-turbine project, proposed 60 miles south of Rhode Island, was also under tentative contract with Massachusetts utility companies to buy the rest of the 1,200 megawatts of nameplate capacity. Massachusetts officials worked in concert with Rhode Island and Connecticut to leverage bulk buying power in a first-of-its-kind tri-state solicitation for projects — even scheduling their contract negotiations to coincide with Rhode Island’s timeline.
The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources did not immediately respond to questions on the status of its contract negotiations Friday.
The deal, if finalized, would have been the second offshore wind project providing power to Rhode Island, providing enough electricity to power 125,000 homes if operating at full capacity. It follows the state’s contract for 400 megawatts of electricity from the Revolution Wind project, now nearing the end of construction in Rhode Island Sound. Environmental advocates and state energy leaders have touted the benefits of wind-powered electricity to stabilize the regional electric grid while helping meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates, including the Act on Climate Law of 2021.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday.
But the nascent offshore wind industry has faced headwinds under the Trump administration, which halted federal reviews on offshore wind projects on Trump’s first day in office. Setbacks mounted as federal regulators then set their sights on projects already past the federal approval stage, including Revolution Wind, which faced a monthlong pause in August that was later overturned by a federal judge’s order. 
Meanwhile, federal regulators sought to revoke key permits for other projects, including the construction and operations plan for SouthCoast Wind granted in the waning days of the Biden administration.
On the same day a federal judge in D.C. granted the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s request to pull back the permit for SouthCoast, Rhode Island energy regulators authorized the project developer’s request for a license to run underwater transmission lines up the Sakonnet River and out Mount Hope Bay. However, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board’s unanimous approval on Nov. 4 was conditioned upon the project receiving all federal and state approvals.

The Democratic share of Connecticut voters dropped almost 2 percentage points since 2020, the Republican portion increased 0.7 percentage points, and voters unaffiliated with any party increased by 1%. 
But Democratic candidates aren’t necessarily losing votes as the party loses registrants — made clear after Democrats flipped control of 28 towns and cities in the Nov. 4 election.
Across the nation, more voters are straying away from political parties. According to Gallup polls, a record 43% of people across the nation self-identified as independent in both 2023 and 2024. Since 2000, the number of self-identifying independents has only reached 43% one other time — in 2014.
But within the state, towns and cities are split on this change. Just under half of towns saw a decrease in the percentage of all voters who were unaffiliated, while a little more than half saw an increase.
For Republican and Democratic registration, though, this is not the case. Nearly every town in the state saw a decrease in registered Democrats 2024 to 2025, with many seeing percent changes of over 1% in just one year.
Republicans got a big bump in party registration — accounting for 0.8% more of all registered voters 2023 to 2025. More than 100 towns saw percent increases in registered Republicans 2024 to 2025, and cities like Hartford and New Haven saw the largest percent increases, following a larger state-wide trend.
More than 20 towns held municipal primaries in 2025, which can affect party registration trends.
Despite having closed primaries, Connecticut is one of ten states that has a higher percent of unaffiliated voters than Democrats or Republicans, as of August 2025 data from Ballotpedia.
While the Republican party is gaining registrants state-wide, only two towns have more registered Republicans than any other party. Most towns had a plurality of unaffiliated voters, but in many places, registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters are neck in neck.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/D4SC7-the-share-of-unaffiliated-ct-voters-has-been-growing--1024x672.png,,,2025-11-14 11:58:51.002434

(Photo courtesy of Northlands Rescue Mission)Most North Dakotans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could see their full November benefits restored as early as Monday, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday it would release the funding for most SNAP recipients within 24 hours of the federal government reopening.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services in a Thursday evening announcement said it was working to get benefits out to residents as soon as possible, but that system updates were pending and it did not have a firm timeline. 
Households that received partial SNAP benefits last week will get the remaining amount, while households that have yet to receive any funding this month will get full benefits, the department said.
“We’re grateful for the full SNAP benefits that support nearly 56,000 North Dakotans,” Pat Traynor, the agency’s interim commissioner, said in the announcement. “The pause revealed the strength of our communities — neighbors, businesses, and organizations stepped up with compassion and resilience.”
Air travel, SNAP benefits, back pay at issue as federal government slowly reopens

The program started the month without funding due to the federal government shutdown, which ended Wednesday night after 43 days.
Partial benefits became available in North Dakota last week after the federal government released 65% of the funding under the order of a federal judge.
While that judge ultimately ordered the executive branch to administer full benefits, President Donald Trump’s administration was appealing the ruling at the time the federal government reopened.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s office earlier this month granted $915,000 in state funds to the Great Plains Food Bank to address food insecurity during the shutdown while funding for SNAP remained uncertain.
Great Plains Food Bank spokesperson Darby Njos said the nonprofit expects to distribute 3.5 million pounds of food in November and December — about a 60% increase in the amount of food it usually distributes to food pantries around the state.
She said even though SNAP will soon be restored, the food bank expects to see high demand for food assistance to continue.
“We’re seeing consistently strong turnouts at our mobile food pantries, at our pop-up pantries, and our partner food pantries have been reporting heavy, consistent usage,” Njos said.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)More than a dozen people voiced their concerns over the latest proposed health insurance rate hikes for West Virginia state employees during a public hearing in Charleston, West Virginia, Thursday evening. 
Seventeen people spoke during a two-hour public hearing held by the Public Employees Insurance Agency finance board at the Culture Center.
Most called on state lawmakers to work with the PEIA board to find a solution for state employees’ rising health insurance costs. 
“I’m asking you: let’s have these conversations,” Joe White, executive director of the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association, told the PEIA finance board. “This can be fixed. That’s my ask. A simple ask. This is real numbers, this is real lives, this is real people.”
White read the PEIA finance board an example of a teacher taking home less pay than they did in previous years because of increases in health insurance costs and a lack of raises. 
“Our folks are working, some of them for free,” White said. “… I tried to Google today what job do you have where you make less money a year after 10 years. Google can’t even give me an answer. Folks are hurting.”
PEIA officials have proposed increasing premiums by 3% for state and non-state employees and employers, and for retirees during fiscal year 2027, which begins in July.
For state employees, a monthly spousal surcharge would increase by an average of $200 per month. The surcharge is for families that have a spouse who chose a PEIA plan despite having the option of a health insurance plan offered by their own employer. 
PEIA officials say they’re bound by the law to make the surcharge the actual cost of the plan. 
Non-state agencies would be required to have at least half of their employees enrolled in a PEIA health plan. 
The proposed rate hikes are not as steep as the increases that went into effect in July, when premiums went up by 14% for state employees, by 16% for local government workers and by 12% for retirees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs also went up. 
Jerry Throckmorton, a Kanawha County teacher for more than 30 years, called the PEIA rate hikes a crisis that could lead to people leaving the teaching profession. 
“If we don’t solve this problem with people retired making less money, people that see their paychecks and they’re making less than they did the year before, that’s going to cause a massive exodus of people,” he said. “We can barely find people to fill slots now.”
He said lawmakers, the governor and the PEIA board should work together to come up with solutions for the crisis. He worries that the younger generation of teachers will disappear.
“Those are the people that will provide the future of the state,” Throckmorton said. “And if we let those people move on to something else because of all these issues, then how will we make West Virginia better?” 
Kanawha County Commissioner Natalie Tennant said the majority of county workers are on a PEIA plan that would increase by 5% next year under the board’s proposal. She noted that according to the agency’s five-year plan, those workers will see a “worrisome” 14% increase in fiscal year 2028. 
Tennant said commissioners approved a 6% pay increase for county workers, the first in three years, that would be eaten if their PEIA rates increase by 5%. 
Increased health care costs affect employee household budgets and the county’s ability to recruit and retain employees, she said. 
“We all know how challenging it is to find and keep skilled public safety workers,” Tennant said. “When benefits become less affordable, good people leave, and when they leave, we just don’t lose employees. You know this — we lose experience. It takes six months to train somebody, right? So we’re behind in training and continuity of services that our citizens depend on.”
Chad Francis, a representative of the United Mine Workers of America, called the premium increases “punishments.”
“[They’re] penalties against the very people who keep West Virginia running: our teachers, our nurses, our highway workers, state troopers and every civil servant who shows up day after day to serve this state,” Francis said. “Let’s be clear about what’s being proposed, a 3% increase in premiums, on top of inflation, stagnant wages and the rising cost of living, a $200 hiking in the spousal penalty, because apparently, being married to someone with employer coverage is now a taxable offense.”
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Leaders have also pointed to a report from the firm BDO that indicated that the sharp rate increases that public workers have had in recent years had been caused in large part because between the years 2018-2022, rates had been frozen. Former Gov. Jim Justice had vowed not to increase the rates during his time as the state’s chief executive.
The series of public hearings will continue in Morgantown Monday and will conclude with a virtual public hearing via Google Meet at 6 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 20.
The PEIA finance board is expected to vote on the proposed increases at its next meeting, slated for Dec. 4.

If this Saturday’s Florida-Ole Miss football game were a bowl game, we all know what its name would be: The Lane Kiffin Bowl. That’s because the worst kept secret in college football is that Florida has zeroed in on Kiffin to be its next head coach.
And, in keeping with the corporate sponsorship of bowl games these days – as in the Allstate Sugar Bowl, Goodyear Cotton Bowl and the Rose Bowl presented by Prudential – I’ve got the perfect name for this one: The Lane Kiffin Bowl, presented by Jimmy Sexton.
Rick Cleveland
Sexton, of course, is Lane Kiffin’s agent. He also represents coaches named Nick Saban, Kirby Smart, Kalen DeBoer, Steve Sarkisian, Mike Norvell, James Franklin, Hugh Freeze and a host of others. He has negotiated hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts for both coaches and athletes so he could easily fund the bowl game sponsorship. He is the Babe Ruth of sports agents. And you know he is loving Saturday’s Lane Kiffin Bowl (6 p.m. kickoff, Vaught-Hemingway Stadium).
Sexton also loves the fact that coaching vacancies exist at LSU and Auburn. The more the merrier, you know. So get your calculators out, and let the bidding begin. You get college football blue bloods Florida and LSU involved in a bidding war and no telling how high the bids will go. 
The fact Ole Miss is a 16.5-point favorite over Florida on Saturday tells you all you need to know about why the demand for Kiffin’s services is so high. Florida has won three national championships and eight SEC Championships since 1990. Ole Miss hasn’t won so much as an SEC division championship in that same period.
Yet, in his six seasons at Ole Miss, the 50-year-old Kiffin has guided the Rebels to 53 victories against just 19 defeats. Perhaps more impressively, his Ole Miss teams are 13 games over .500 in the SEC. Compare that to Tommy Tuberville, who was 12 games below .500 in the SEC when he left Ole Miss in 1998 to take the Auburn job. (Sexton was Sen. Tuberville’s agent, too.)
Little wonder Florida wants Kiffin. Gator fans look at Kiffin and see Steve Spurrier 35 years ago. They see a brash, visor-wearing, offensive-minded coach whose wide receivers always seem to run wide open through opponents’ defenses. They see what Kiffin has done at Ole Miss and can only imagine what he might do at Florida.
Ole Miss enters Saturday’s game at 8-1 and No. 7 in the college football playoff rankings. This has the potential to be the greatest season in Rebel football history. But at a time when everyone who bleeds red and blue should be focused on beating Florida, many are instead worried sick about losing their coach. Keep in mind, they have been down this road before.
The Rebels were 8-1 and ranked No. 11 about this time in 2022. The Auburn job was open then and various news reports had Kiffin headed for the Plains. And you know what happened next. Ole Miss, a clearly distracted football team, lost four straight games.
Eventually, Kiffin stayed at Ole Miss. The Rebels have won 30 games in the nearly three seasons since. Ole Miss has given Kiffin everything he has asked for – beyond a salary of  about $9.5 million per year. Ole Miss supporters are bankrolling a football NIL budget of more than $20 million a year and an assistant coaches salary pool of more than $8 million a year.
We could debate forever which is the better job. Five years ago, I would have said Florida, hands down. But not now. The transfer portal and NIL have changed everything in college football. Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter, NIL guru Walker Jones and, yes, Kiffin have been on the cutting edge in all that. 
Florida, with a bigger stadium, is located in a much larger state amid much more football talent. But with all that comes higher expectations. Remember, Dan Mullen won 60% of his games in nine seasons at Mississippi State and then took the Florida job. He won nearly 70% of his games in four seasons with the Gators – and got his butt fired.
Kiffin could end all that speculation and avoid a repeat of 2022, Instead, in a press conference earlier this week he added fuel to the fire. “There are still advantages for the traditional ‘blue bloods,’” Kiffin said. “Kids still care about stadium size, history, Heismans, national championships, and location to talent…”
I have no clue what Kiffin will do. He may not either. I do know all this speculation has really increased interest in a game in which a 9-1 team is heavily favored over a team that has won only three games and already has fired its coach. The Lane Kiffin Bowl, it is.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/06141438/AP_22303188392546-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-14 10:57:30.270956

The New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions this week launched the Rural Education-Workforce Collaborative, an initiative connecting early education through 12th grade in rural school districts with career development opportunities in high-demand fields.
The $400,000 initiative is funded through the Community Benefit Fund, which falls under the Department of Workforce Solutions. The fund was created during the 2025 Legislative Session to support programs that reduce climate change impacts and create worker training programs for industries that address such programs.
“We created the Community Benefit Plan to spark exactly this type of creative partnership,” President Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) said in a statement. “This investment will give young people real skills and paths to stay in the rural communities they love while building our state’s capacity to face the challenges of a changing climate and economy.”
According to the Department of Workforce Solutions, the new model is a collaboration between the department, rural PreK-12 school districts, institutions of higher education and Collegiate Edu-Nation, a nonprofit organization that consults with rural school districts across the country to end education and income inequality. The program will “expand access for rural students by integrating education and workforce resources such as dual credit programs, free college tuition and work-based learning opportunities.”
The goal is to prepare rural, low-income, first-generation students and those with disabilities or from tribal communities to meet the state’s growing workforce needs. The Collegiate Edu-Nation initiative started in Texas and now includes New Mexico public school districts such as Corona Public Schools, Mosquero Municipal Schools and Loving Municipal Schools. 
“This workforce-school partnership tackles several challenges at once by connecting education to real world opportunities from the earliest stage, creating opportunities for rural youth and building our workforce in climate-ready and infrastructure careers,” Department of Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair said in a statement. “The collaborative will demonstrate how much we can accomplish when we join forces with innovative rural school districts and the local workforce development board to give students true options for their futures and strengthen New Mexico’s economy.”
According to Lee White, superintendent of Loving Municipal Schools, it is difficult to connect students in rural communities to “real world opportunities that align with regional industry trends.” 
I believe that we are on the cusp of effectively changing student outcomes through this model and partnership,” White said in a statement.
The Department of Workforce Solutions noted that a dashboard will be used to measure academic and workforce outcomes going forward.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rural-Education-Workforce-01-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 10:00:17.957968

Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, will take over the case from embattled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, Skandalakis announced Friday.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee had tasked Skandalakis with finding a replacement for Willis by Friday or he would allow the case to be dismissed.
Skandalakis said he contacted “several” other prosecutors who declined to take up the case.
“The decision to assume responsibility for this matter was reached only after careful and deliberate consideration,” Skandalakis wrote. “While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee’s deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured—thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution—I did not believe that to be the right course of action.”
Skandalakis said he recently received 101 banker boxes of documents related to the Trump investigation and an 8-terabyte hard drive containing the complete investigative file.
“Since receiving these materials, I have diligently worked to familiarize myself with the record and the status of the proceedings,” he said. “Additionally, I have attempted to review the evidence gathered and the hours of interviews and proffers of witnesses and former codefendants.  Unfortunately, I have not had sufficient time to complete my review. With Judge McAfee’s deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case. This will allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed.”
A Fulton County grand jury  indicted Trump in 2023 when he was out of office along with 18 others who she alleged formed a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, which Trump narrowly lost to President Joe Biden.
Following the loss, Trump had famously called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and asked him to “find” the missing votes he would have needed to win. The alleged scheme also involved plans to submit a bogus slate of electors to falsely certify that Trump had won the election, a harassment campaign against Fulton County poll workers and a voting systems breach in Coffee County.
Four of the alleged co-conspirators pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Trump and the other defendants, who maintained their innocence.
But the beginning of the case’s end came when an attorney for defendant Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign aide, introduced evidence that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had been involved in a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired for the case with a lucrative contract, creating a potential conflict of interest.
After dramatic testimony including descriptions of vacations and cruises the two had taken together, a judge ordered that either Wade or Willis’ office needed to step aside from the case.
Wade resigned from the case, but Willis was ultimately disqualified from pursuing the charges against Trump by the Georgia Court of Appeals because of the “significant appearance of impropriety” stemming from their relationship. The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis’ appeal in September, leaving the case officially in need of a new prosecutor.
Georgia’s case is the last criminal case still pending against Trump.
Prosecution against Trump himself may stall while he is serving as president, but the cases against other alleged co-conspirators could move forward. That could represent a stumbling block for the president after other legal developments have gone his way.
U.S. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith dropped a federal election interference case as well as a case alleging Trump mishandled classified documents after Trump’s 2024 election victory because it would be illegal to continue prosecuting him after taking office.
A New York state appeals court overturned a nearly $500 million civil penalty Trump was ordered to pay in a case involving fraudulent loan applications, though the judges left the fraud finding in place.
Trump is appealing a New York conviction involving hush money payments to adult film star Storsmy Daniels, which gave him the status of being the only felon elected president, and he’s seeking Supreme Court intervention in a civil case over a claim that he sexually abused and defamed writer E. Jean Carroll.

The Catholic hospital owned by Trinity Health of New England cited persistent staffing constraints as the reason for the suspension. Providers will continue to offer prenatal and postnatal care at outpatient sites throughout Western Massachusetts, according to a press release, but babies will not be delivered at the hospital. The medical center reached an agreement with nearby Baystate Medical Center in Springfield to handle many of Mercy’s maternity patients. 
Mercy Medical Center spokesperson Mary Orr did not give an estimated timeline for how long delivery services may be suspended, but a statement from the hospital said it “will continue to pursue all options to resume continuous, safe, high-quality maternity care.”  
But Alan Sager, a Boston University School of Public Health professor, said there is reason to sound the alarm.  
“This is not pretty,” Sager said. “You lose the doctors who retire and relocate when the hospital closes or when the service shuts down, and then it’s very hard to attract doctors or nurses back into an underserved area.”  
Nearly 77 percent of Mercy’s patient revenue came from Medicaid and Medicare as of 2023, and “Medicaid is not a generous payer,” Sager noted.  
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity units, according to Health Policy Commission data. Holyoke Medical Center just north of Springfield permanently closed its maternity services unit in 2020 a few months after temporarily shuttering it, later citing the unit’s persistent annual financial losses as the reason for the closure. Many patients from Holyoke have since sought care at Mercy. 
“Given Mercy’s location in Springfield serving a fairly heavy mix of Latino patients … the closing of Mercy’s maternity care can dislocate patients who may find it hard to obtain care they’re equally comfortable with elsewhere,” Sager said. “Language-related differences matter to patients. They’re disadvantaged by the successive displacements of care.”  
The Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA) has argued that the Department of Public Health should be acting more aggressively by treating the suspension like an essential service closure, which provides a mechanism for DPH to review a proposed closure or reduction in services. DPH did not respond to a request for comment.  
Jaime Hyatt, a registered nurse serving as co-chair of the MNA bargaining committee at Mercy where he has worked for nearly 25 years, says the staffing issues did not arise overnight.  
“Nurses have witnessed deliberate inaction on Trinity Health’s part to backfill vacant positions – especially on the provider side – as evidenced by job postings offering below-market wages,” Hyatt and bargaining co-chair Dee Doyle said in a statement. “This failure to adequately recruit and retain staff has led directly to the erosion of care we see today.”  
Mercy declined to answer questions about the maternity unit’s staffing levels and its efforts to recruit and retain employees.  
Just over 800 babies were delivered at Mercy in 2022, according to most recent DPH data. Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton and Baystate in Springfield are the two nearest remaining options for patients from Holyoke, Springfield, Chicopee, Westfield, and other surrounding towns. Sager said hospitals are not “interchangeable parts,” and shuttering a service “rips apart the fabric of care” where patients once felt comfortable. 
“Springfield is the third largest city in the Commonwealth. How is it possible that there’s no choice of care?” Hyatt said. “It does not seem like the choice should be one hospital in Springfield.”  
The financial stability of Mercy Medical Center came into question this summer after reports surfaced that Baystate Health was in talks to acquire the hospital, which Hyatt and Doyle say left staff feeling “vulnerable and compelled to seek employment elsewhere.” In April, the Boston Globe reported on Mercy’s “exodus” of emergency room doctors and its hiring of a private, for-profit medical staffing agency that led to staff departures and pay cuts. In 2024, the hospital lost nearly $30 million and had the lowest profit margin among all independent health systems and hospitals in the state at –9.2 percent.  
Hyatt said he is worried the hospital will soon begin seeing births in its emergency department.   
“If they are far enough along, there’s not going to be time to send them down the street to Baystate,” he said. 
Pulling back services even temporarily in a region with already-limited options for maternal health care has nurses and providers like Hyatt concerned that Western Massachusetts could later become a maternity desert. 
“By letting this close, it shows that we are in contraction as opposed to expansion,” he said.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hospital-1024x768.png,,,2025-11-14 10:00:17.957968

A week after Typhoon Halong passed through Japan in early October, its remnants crossed the Pacific and struck western Alaska. Nearly 50 Alaska Native communities across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta near the Bering Sea were met with towering wind speeds, record storm surge, and widespread flooding. At least one person died, and 1,500 adults and children, who were mostly Yup’ik, were displaced from the villages. Initial estimates have reported that the storm decimated 90 percent of homes in the coastal village of Kipnuk and 35 percent in Kwigillingok, which has also experienced toxic chemicals spilling into its freshwater supply.
“It’s going to take years to recover from the disaster,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski at the Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention last month. “After the floodwaters recede, and after the damage to the homes and the fish camp is calculated, there’s so much work that remains and so much healing that is needed.”
State and federal resources are being mobilized to respond to the disaster. On October 22, alongside Governor Mike Dunleavy’s state emergency declaration and release of disaster relief funds, President Donald Trump authorized a federal emergency declaration and $25 million in funds for recovery and rebuilding efforts. State agencies such as the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management have also begun moving evacuees into long-term housing.
“This declaration is a critical step toward recovery, but it must be the beginning of a broader, sustained response,” said Vivian Korthius, who is Yup’ik and the CEO of the Association of Village Council Presidents, in a statement.
Kipnuk and the other villages hit by the storm have been on the front lines of climate change for more than a decade. Rising temperatures have caused permafrost to melt, causing land subsidence and flooding throughout the delta. According to the Alaska Climate Research Center, Typhoon Halong also exhibited characteristics consistent with the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures have changed the nature of tropical cyclones, leading to heavier rainfall, hurricane-like winds, and taller waves. The storm surge that struck Kipnuk, for instance, broke a 25-year-old record.
Many of the Alaska Native villages affected by Typhoon Halong were established in coastal areas as a result of the colonial policies imposed by the United States government. When the Russian Empire arrived in Alaska during the early 19th century, fur traders sought to benefit from the industry’s boom along the coastline. After Russia sold the land to the United States in 1867, the federal government aimed not only to seize and occupy lands but to encourage assimilation through boarding and day schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The boarding school era played a crucial role in how villages were organized. Tribal communities sought to keep their children at home, given that boarding schools forced them to live away from their tribal cultures and were associated with abuse. As a result, Yu’pik communities chose to live near and send their children to village schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
“They were told, or at least it was implied, if not told, that you need to settle here to send your kids to school, or they may be sent away to boarding school,” said Sheryl Musgrove, the climate justice programs director at the Alaska Institute for Justice, who oversees climate adaptation, mitigation, and relocation with village partners in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
The historic passage of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, commonly known in the state as ANCSA, also reshaped where communities settled. The law abolished existing Native land claims in exchange for 44 million acres to be managed through private regional and village corporations. These for-profit entities, which operate in industries such as logging and oil, created jobs and encouraged settlement in centralized villages and regional hubs. As a result, settlements further solidified along the coast and near rivers.
Given that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that Alaska’s summer waters will be ice-free in the next decade, communities have been trying to relocate with the assistance of tribal corporations. But relocating an entire village is a tall order. Costs are high, and selecting a site to relocate to with assistance from the regional corporation can be challenging. For instance, 300 people from Newtok, a village north of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, moved 9 miles away to a new village known as Metarvik late last year. But the infrastructure in Metarvik is already falling apart. Electricity is intermittent, running water is lacking, and residents have had to use 5-gallon buckets as toilets. The project, which was meant to serve as a model for other villages, received millions in federal grants but ultimately lacked federal guidance and fell short of meeting residents’ needs.
Despite a different legal terrain and colonial legacy, the federal government still has treaty responsibilities to uphold toward tribes in Alaska. In May, the Environmental Protection Agency canceled a $20 million flood protection grant awarded by the Biden administration last year. This landmark grant was expected to accelerate relocation for many villages. Rescinding funding was yet another example of the lack of federal investment, Musgrove said.
Due to the severity of the storm’s impact, Kwigillingok leaders have elected to proceed with relocation. It’s a decision that the Alaska Institute for Justice will assist with.
“No one knows what the future brings, and we need serious investments in these communities like Kwigillingok and Kipnuk to be able to rebuild or relocate — whichever they choose to,” said Musgrove. “So they can be safe from that next storm, whenever that next storm is in frame.”

People continue to die from drug overdoses in Los Angeles County jails — yet the county’s Department of Health Services has scaled back the accessibility of opioid addiction treatment for people behind bars, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
In a Sept. 16 memo obtained by CalMatters, Chief Medical Officer Sean Henderson said that Correctional Health Services will take “a pause on primary care in ordering buprenorphine,” a medication that curbs cravings and prevents overdoses. The new guidance also directs prioritizing people who first enter the jail system for treatment, and placing everyone else who wants medication on a waitlist. As of Oct. 31, over 800 people were on the waitlist.
Injectable buprenorphine costs about $1,600 per shot, with nearly 40,000 doses of buprenorphine administered in L.A. County jails since July 2022. The county sets aside about $25 million a year for the treatment program. Its Department of Health Services said the new rules — which restrict access to buprenorphine — were made “to help maximize the reach of (the) program.” The statement did not say how making it harder or having patients wait longer to access buprenorphine would positively affect the reach of the program. 
Critics argue the policy shift is dangerous, and that delaying treatment can lead to more fatal overdoses. 

A physician from the Correctional Health Services who spoke with CalMatters on the condition of anonymity: “Patients are begging me for help. I’m on edge, waiting to see if someone is going to die.”

The change comes as the state is suing L.A. County over the poor conditions of its jails and the high rate of in-custody deaths. Overdoses have made up 28% of jail deaths this year, compared to 9% in 2016, according to a September memo from the director of the county’s correctional health services.

More people want to investigate State Farm

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
As L.A.-area fire survivors complain about insurance-claim delays and denials, the county on Thursday launched an investigation into State Farm’s handling of its policyholders’ claims. It is the second government probe into the insurer this year in California.
The county told State Farm that if it is “engaging in any unlawful or unfair business practices,” it should stop, according to a letter from County Counsel Dawyn Harrison. The county also asked the insurer for detailed information, including about all claims filed related to the January fires, as well as its practices related to smoke damage and insurance adjusters.
State Farm said in a statement that this probe by the county “will be another distraction from our ongoing work in California to help our customers recover from this tragedy.” It said it has been cooperating with the earlier investigation launched by the state Insurance Department in June.
Fire survivors complain the state’s investigation is taking too long, and last week called on Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to resign.



Senate Pro Tem eyes congressional seat

California’s leading state senator, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, is making a bid for Congress following the end of his 12-year term limit next year, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
The Santa Rosa Democrat seeks to represent California’s 1st District — one of the districts that has been drastically redrawn under Proposition 50 to favor Democrats. 
During his time in the Legislature, McGuire focused on wildfire prevention after wildfires in Sonoma and Napa counties destroyed thousands of homes and claimed dozens of lives in 2017. In one of the state’s budget bills this year, he also secured the most “pork-barrel” earmarks for local projects in his district.
The 1st District has been comfortably held by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who has represented the northern part of the state in Congress since 2013. For his support of President Donald Trump’s recent budget bill, which guts Medicaid spending by more than $1.1 trillion over 10 years, constituents slammed LaMalfa in August over a move they said will harm rural hospitals and residents.

Changes at this agency signal a pro-building shift,Nadia Lathan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/11/coastal-commission-housing/,Three new pro-development appointees at the powerful Coastal Commission are trying to remedy its poor reputation among housing activists and Democratic leaders.,"In summary
Three new pro-development appointees at the powerful Coastal Commission are trying to remedy its poor reputation among housing activists and Democratic leaders.


Bone-colored bluffs and jagged cliffs line the Monterey shoreline where chalky sand meets redwoods.
Its rugged coastline, including beloved destinations such as Big Sur, is well-known California iconography protected by the California Coastal Act for nearly 50 years.
In a push to address the state’s gripping housing crisis, the California Coastal Commission last week approved a rule change to make it easier to build affordable housing in Monterey and elsewhere along the hundreds of miles of the Pacific coast. 
It was the latest effort by the powerful state agency to combat its poor reputation among housing advocates and Democratic leaders who see it as an obstacle to drastic housing reform in California’s coveted coastal regions. While minor and uncontroversial, the amendment was one of a few shifts the commission has made in recent months in an effort to be viewed as playing a part in addressing the state’s crippling housing crisis.
It released a report for the first time in 2024 that showed local governments were responsible for approving the vast majority of permits in coastal regions, and this year the agency worked with housing activists to make it easier to build student housing in coastal cities. Nor did the coastal commission oppose the landmark housing reform law that excludes most new developments from environmental review.
“I think it’s going to have a real-life change,” Susan Jordan, a longtime conservation activist and founder of the California Coastal Protection Network, said of the regulatory amendment at the meeting.
Reputation rehab: Steps toward more housing
Twelve people — six local elected officials and six members of the public — vote on the independent, quasi-judicial state agency tasked with conserving more than 800 miles of the California coast and keeping it open to the public. Its authority spans about 1,000 yards inland from where the land meets the water at high tide.
The commission has faced relentless scrutiny in recent years for not permitting enough affordable housing in coastal cities, or doing so too slowly, as state lawmakers have stripped numerous housing regulations to make it easier to build more apartments.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, a critic of the commission, and other Democratic leaders have appointed three pro-development local officials this year to help get more housing and other developments approved along the Pacific coast.
In October, Newsom appointed wealthy real estate developer Jaime Lee to replace Effie Turnbull Sanders. An attorney appointed by former Gov. Jerry Brown, Sanders was lauded by environmentalists for heralding environmental justice policies to the agency.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, named two pro-development appointees to the commission in May: Chris Lopez, a Monterey County supervisor, and Chula Vista councilmember Jose Preciado.
Ray Jackson, a Hermosa Beach councilmember, was appointed earlier this year by Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire of Santa Rosa, and is largely a skeptic of big developers.
In a unanimous vote last week, Peciado, Lopez and Jackson each approved changing the commission’s rules to give affordable housing projects in coastal areas more time to be built, from two to five years after permits are issued. Lee was not at the Nov. 6 meeting.
Staff and commissioners hailed the change as a step in the right direction for affordable housing developments that cannot be financed quickly enough under the previous two-year deadline.
“I think next year would be a good opportunity to roll out an education campaign in the Legislature to highlight some of the movements we made toward this,” Commissioner Linda Escalante said. “I don’t know if we can have a white paper that we can walk around with and figure out some of the reputation issues that we have.”
A history of protecting the coastline
Critics of the commission point to the exorbitant coastal housing prices, some of the highest in the country, and the disproportionate number of white residents, as exacerbating the housing shortage. To some, the commission’s priorities have not matched the urgency of lawmakers and local officials to help solve the cost problem.
Two-thirds of coastal residents are white, about twice as many as in the state as a whole, according to an analysis by Nicholas Depsky at the United Nations Development Programme. 
Fewer than 2.5% of California residents live in coastal cities, or “coastal zones,” which comprise less than 1% of land in the state but are home to some of the most valuable real estate in the world, from Malibu to Marin.

The Coastal Commission began as a 1972 ballot initiative in the shadow of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, one of the worst environmental disasters in the country at the time. Amid a broader national environmental movement, there was greater concern about how to protect California’s coveted shoreline in the midst of unregulated offshore drilling and fears of relentless development that would mirror Miami’s coastline. 
Four years later, the state Legislature made the commission permanent with the Coastal Act to protect its natural habitats and keep beaches open to the public.
Early tensions between then-Gov. Jerry Brown and the commission brewed when he slammed its members as “bureaucratic thugs” in 1978, just years after championing its creation. Brown would spend his final years in office, nearly 40 years later, roiled by criticism from environmentalists who accused him of appointing commissioners who were too pro-development. Those fears were heightened with the ousting of executive director Charles Lester in 2016, a strong advocate for coastal protection.
Scrutiny of the commission has accelerated in the Newsom administration, as the governor has publicly chided the agency for its broad powers. After the Los Angeles fires, he swiftly moved to suspend all of its authority over rebuilding efforts in the Pacific Palisades, which abut the coastline. 
Last year, the commission rejected billionaire Elon Musk’s proposal to increase the number of SpaceX rocket launches off the Santa Barbara coast while criticizing his support of President Donald Trump. Newsom said he was “with Elon” after the company filed a lawsuit for political discrimination. The case is still pending. 
Lee, the newest commissioner, hails from Los Angeles and has built a reputation as a prolific builder known for revitalizing Koreatown. Her real estate company, Jamison properties, has built 6,600 multifamily units and is one of the largest private landowners in Los Angeles, according to its website.
Lee did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment from CalMatters.
The new appointments have made many pro-housing advocates hopeful. “We now have three out of 12 voting members who are appointed to the commission in this period when many legislators and the governor want reform at the commission to design more affordable housing,” said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist with the business coalition Bay Area Council. “That tells me that these members will probably move that vision forward.”
Lopez, who has emphasized his support for affordable housing on the coast since joining the commission, said the optimism is warranted.
“I think that that excitement is well placed given where we’re sitting at right now and given the voice that the speaker and the governor are giving at this issue and wanting to see a remedy to it,” Lopez said. “And I do feel it’s the reason I was put here was to have that conversation at the forefront.”
Environmental advocates watch
Environmentalists have mostly been quiet about the new appointments. Instead, they are waiting to see how they vote before raising the alarm.
“While there have been concerns expressed within the environmental movement, at this point we have no idea how this commissioner (Lee) will be,” said Jennifer Savage, associate director of Surfrider Foundation, a coastal protection advocacy group. Lee was not an obvious choice for many, but Savage is optimistic that she’ll support coastal protection.
“It’s actually not that surprising that the governor would appoint someone with housing expertise,” given the political climate, she continued. 
A longtime local water authority official and current administrator at San Diego State University, Preciado said part of his pitch for the role to top Democratic leaders was that he wanted to see more of the coast developed to help create jobs and homes for working-class families.
“We have a keen interest in developing the California coast in such a way where underrepresented communities that live on the coast have more access,” Preciado said of himself and Lopez.
Wealthy coastal residents have long sparred with the commission over violations for blocking public access, such as Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla, who has been entangled in a slew of legal fights with regulators and coastal groups for years over access to Martins Beach near Half Moon Bay.

Many commissioners and staff view protecting public access and conservation as their primary purpose rather than housing policy. 
Conservationism is out of style, even among Democrats, which has led support for the commission to dramatically shift in recent years, according to legislative director Sarah Christie.
To some commissioners, lawmakers’ push to rip away more and more of its housing authority is a misguided attempt to simplify a complex issue. They point out that 80% of coastal cities and counties have their own coastal laws and are not subject to the commission.
“It’s creating a lot of chaos and dysfunction at the local level and is making it harder,” Christie said of the movement toward slashing housing regulations. “In the Legislature’s enthusiasm and zeal in order to effectuate housing more quickly, they’re kind of stepping on themselves.”
Jackson, a commissioner who represents the South Bay, said lawmakers need to focus more on affordable housing rather than increasing supply more broadly.
Special environmental considerations and its highly sought after nature are what make the coastal zone uniquely expensive, Preciado said. “I think that a broader view, a more objective view, is that developing on the coast is different than developing in urban areas.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/090324_Coastal-Erosion_AH_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

Education leaders, students and lawmakers will meet Nov. 17  to address a stark reality: The federal government is slashing support for higher education in unprecedented ways. 
They’ll attend the California Assembly Higher Education Committee to discuss how federal budget cuts, regulations and executive orders will affect millions of current and prospective college students across California.  
This isn’t business as usual. Given massive changes at the federal level, California will have to develop new strategies to ensure students can still afford to attend and complete college. 
Fortunately, with smart, deliberate policy our state can still unlock higher education for thousands more students — and deliver a major boost to the economy. The key is uplifting a little-discussed group of Californians: prospective students who come from low- or middle-income households and have little or no family wealth. 
These students, who we refer to as “dually-disadvantaged,” are often eager to attend college but don’t have sufficient funds or support. That’s largely because our financial aid system is designed to make income the primary factor determining state and federal aid. 
Certainly income is important. But family wealth — which includes such assets as savings, investments, real estate, and business revenue — also makes a huge difference in determining whether a student can realistically afford to attend and complete college.
Nationally, 52% of dually-disadvantaged students from low-income, low-wealth households are predicted to go to college, compared to 83% of students from low-income, high-wealth households. 
Among those who start college, only 20% of dually-disadvantaged students are expected to complete, compared to 59% of their similarly low-income, but higher-wealth peers.  
Here in California, nearly a quarter of FAFSA filers are both low-income and low-wealth, amounting to 41,730 first-time, in-state students a year. 
Wealth inequality in the state is even more extreme than income inequality, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. 
The wealthiest households have a net worth estimated at $1.3 million. That’s more than 100 times higher than those near the bottom, whose net worth is about $12,000. Latino and Black households disproportionately have low wealth.
Nevertheless, the Cal Grant program does little to adjust for wealth among eligible students. Two students with the same family income are treated equally, even if one has no wealth and the other has $200,000 in assets. 
California’s Middle Class Scholarship, a separate state financial aid program, has similar issues. It originally was designed to support families whose income is too high to qualify for other aid but who still need support to afford college without hefty student loans. 
Since then, the program has evolved to also support low-income students. In fact, the majority of recipients come from families that make no more than $50,000 annually. 
However, several aspects of the program’s latest design, including its high asset ceiling at  $234,000, limit the program’s ability to target recipients from families with little to no wealth.
Better ways to help the dually-disadvantaged
Fortunately, there are several ways to address the economic needs of California’s students. 
First, we can offer targeted support to dually-disadvantaged students. Following the model of the existing Students with Dependent Children Grant, the state can provide an “access award” for non-tuition costs to these students. 
New research confirms just how powerful such a supplemental grant could be. An October report simulated the possible costs and benefits if California awarded an additional $5,000 grant to students who are in the bottom third of income and have no wealth. The grant would result in about 4,590 more graduates in California per cohort and a boost in state gross domestic product of $966 million — a huge return on a cost of $208 million. 
Second, we can reform the middle class scholarship by better accounting for the full picture of a student’s financial resources. 
If the purpose of the program is to reduce borrowing among low- and middle-class families, then we should design it to better target students who lack the income and wealth to cover college without borrowing at high rates or working excessive hours. This revision would preserve and more equitably center the middle class scholarships, aligning them with statewide goals to support an affordable higher education.
Third, lawmakers can direct additional funding to colleges and universities that disproportionately serve students who are low-wealth and low- or middle-income. And education institutions should provide more holistic support, such as transportation or housing, or better funding for highly utilized on-campus services — such as basic needs centers or student success programs.
There’s no question that federal cuts will introduce a host of new challenges for California’s higher education system. But we can still create strategies that support the students who need it most.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/032725_UC-Merced_LV_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

Hundreds of people are on a waitlist for opioid addiction treatment in Los Angeles County jails as the state presses the system to reduce overdoses and in-custody deaths


Los Angeles County jails pared back access to life-saving opioid addiction treatment this fall during one of the system’s deadliest years on record, according to records obtained by CalMatters and interviews with staff. 
The policy change came one week after Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit against the county over “inhumane” conditions across its jail system, citing a “shocking rate of deaths,” including overdoses. 
In interviews with CalMatters, two Correctional Health Services physicians expressed alarm over the reductions, saying that even the slightest delay in treatment is “wildly dangerous” and can lead to more fatal overdoses. 
“Patients are begging me for help,” said a physician who spoke with CalMatters on the condition of anonymity because of fear of professional retaliation. “I’m on edge, waiting to see if someone is going to die.”
The reduction in treatment also comes as the jails hold about 700 more people every day as a result of a tough-on-crime ballot measure voters approved last year. Proposition 36 increased sentences for certain drug and theft crimes, leading to a surge in jail populations and straining county resources, according to a Sept. 10 Correctional Health Services memo to the Board of Supervisors. 
Los Angeles County allocates roughly $25 million annually for the treatment program. County supervisors this year gave the program an additional $8 million from opioid lawsuit settlements. That sum ultimately did not increase funding for treatment because the department used the money for a different need, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.
“The overall (medication-assisted treatment) program funding remained the same” despite the extra money the department received, the statement reads.
In a Sept. 16 memo obtained by CalMatters, Chief Medical Officer Sean Henderson said Correctional Health Services “will be taking a pause on primary care in ordering buprenorphine.” The medication reduces cravings and prevents overdoses. 
The new mandate restricts how quickly and broadly Correctional Health Services physicians can prescribe the medication. Priority will be given to people when they first enter the jail system — the largest in California — which houses roughly 13,000 people across nine main facilities. Everyone else who wants medication will be placed on a waitlist. 
“It’s misleading because we just put people on this list and then they stay on the list,” said a physician.
That means that if someone does not accept treatment upon arrival, they won’t be able to access it during the remainder of their incarceration, even if they change their mind, said both physicians who spoke with CalMatters. 
Legal experts and physicians say there could be a myriad of reasons why people deny treatment when they’re first arrested and incarcerated. For example, a person could be unfit to make medical decisions if they are in active withdrawal.
Waitlist grew for opioid treatment
Between 2,350 and 2,650 incarcerated people in Los Angeles County receive medication-assisted treatment on any given day, said the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services in an email to CalMatters. 
As of Sept. 15 — just one day before the policy change went into effect — 363 people were on a waiting list for treatment, the department said.
But that number skyrocketed to 835 people as of Oct. 31. The total includes 471 newcomers who have never been on the program; the remainder are people who asked to re-enroll after dropping out. As of October, the average wait time is 25 days, the department said. The department declined to answer how long the person waiting the longest has been in line for treatment. 
In a statement to CalMatters, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services said the policy change was intended “to help maximize the reach of (its) treatment program within the jails by leveraging the existing medical staff in the (Inmate Reception Center) where patient traffic is constant.”
The department maintained that medication-assisted treatment is “still available for all inmates, including those who may have declined treatment when they first arrived.”
“Length of incarceration varies for each inmate, from just a handful of days for some and many months for others; whether an individual will access (medication-assisted treatment) during their incarceration is based on their personal choice, unique case and the length of time they will remain incarcerated,” wrote the department.
Melissa Camacho, a senior staff attorney at ACLU of Southern California, said the reduction in treatment is “mind boggling” in a year where there are record-breaking deaths.
“I’d like to know how many people who died from overdose deaths were on the waiting list,” she said. “Having a waitlist doesn’t matter if the waitlist is too long to get treatment.”
More money for L.A. jail health care
Medication-assisted treatment combines counseling with FDA-approved medications, including buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone to treat certain substance use disorders. A 2021 report from the National Commission on Correctional Health Care found that drug and alcohol overdoses constitute the third leading cause of death in jails, following illness and suicide. 
Los Angeles County was an early adopter of medication-assisted treatment in its jails. Since the program’s inception in 2021, roughly 25,000 incarcerated people have been treated with Suboxone, an oral form of buprenorphine administered daily by medical professionals. But reliance on Suboxone alone proved to be challenging because of staffing limitations, said the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services in an email to CalMatters. 
That’s why, according to Correctional Health Services physicians, the current regimen only allows someone to access Suboxone for 30 days when they first arrive in custody. After that, they can receive a long-acting injectable form of buprenorphine that’s administered once a month. 
Since July 2022, nearly 40,000 doses of injectable buprenorphine — which cost roughly $1,600 per shot — have been administered to incarcerated people, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
In a Sept. 10 memo to the Board of Supervisors, Correctional Health Services’ Director Christina Ghaly said overdose deaths constitute at least 28% of deaths this year. That’s a steep increase since 2016, when they accounted for 9% of in-custody deaths.

(Getty Images)Louisiana prohibits casino companies and executives from making state political contributions, but that same ban doesn’t apply to sports gambling operations. 
A sport betting company and its senior management can still make political donations, even if the business is a subsidiary of a larger gambling enterprise prohibited from doing so, according to the Louisiana Board of Ethics. 
The ethics board issued an advisory opinion last week to American Wagering Inc., saying the company, as well as its officers and directors, can legally give to political candidates. The political activity is allowed even though the mobile and retail sports betting company, which goes by the name Caesars Sportsbook Louisiana, is owned by the gambling conglomerate, Caesars Entertainment Inc. 

In addition to having a sportsbook, Caesars Entertainment Inc. owns three casinos in Louisiana — Caesars New Orleans, Horseshoe Lake Charles and Horseshoe Bossier City. A state law from 1996 prohibits those casinos, their parent company and the casinos’ executive managers from making political contributions.
But the ethics board concluded the campaign contribution restriction doesn’t apply to the sports betting company or its executives, unless they also hold senior positions with Caesars Entertainment Inc. or the company’s casinos. 
“There is no provision under which [the political contribution ban] applies to AWI directly,” ethics board attorney Charles Reeves wrote in the board’s opinion approved last week. 
The board’s decision is the latest strike against the state’s efforts to block the gambling industry’s influence from state politics. The campaign contribution ban was put in place to create some distance between the gambling industry and Louisiana politicians following the botched rollout of riverboat casinos in the early 1990s. 

The Louisiana Supreme Court first chipped away at the ban in 1996 by ruling it was unconstitutional for video poker operators that run operate in smaller venues like truck stops. However, the court’s decision did not apply to larger casinos, which are still subject to the prohibition today. 

Last week’s advisory opinion is the latest of three from the ethics board that indicate sports betting companies can make political donations. 

In 2022, the ethics board also told the Sports Betting Alliance, a trade association for online and retail sports betting companies, that it was allowed to make political contributions, even if one of its members was prohibited from doing so. 
In 2023, the board said Fanatics Betting and Gaming, an online betting company which is not affiliated with a casino  company, could also contribute to political campaigns. 
From July 2023 through June 2024, Louisiana’s riverboat casinos had $1.7 billion of adjusted gross revenue and the New Orleans casino brought in $240.5 million in gaming revenue. Video poker machines had net device revenue of $749.8 million. In-person sports betting produced net proceeds of $29.8 million and mobile sports betting produced net proceeds of $358.2 million.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Super-Bowl-betting-1024x636.jpg,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

A new report estimates the impacts,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/11/data-center-environmental-report/,"A new report estimates that California’s data centers are driving increases in electricity use, water demand and pollution even as lawmakers stall on oversight.","In summary
A new report estimates that California’s data centers are driving increases in electricity use, water demand and pollution even as lawmakers stall on oversight.


California is a major hub for data centers — the facilities that store and transmit much of the internet. But just how much these power-hungry operations affect the state’s energy use, climate and public health remains an open question for researchers.
A new report released this week by the environmental think tank Next 10 and a UC Riverside researcher attempts to quantify that impact — but its authors say the report is only an estimate without harder data from the centers themselves.
“We are just making these reports pretty much in the dark — since there’s almost zero information,” said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside and co-author of the report. “We have extremely little information about data centers in California.”
Ren and his coauthors conclude that between 2019 and 2023, electricity use and carbon emissions by California data centers nearly doubled, while on-site water consumption slightly more than doubled. Much of the increases were attributable to the electricity required to run artificial intelligence computations. But many of the report’s estimates, including its health impacts, are based on limited data — a key issue researchers said they encountered repeatedly when crafting the report.
The report underscores a growing tension in the industry: advocates who support clean energy and experts who study energy demand agree the days of steady, flat energy use at data centers are over, but there’s far less consensus on just how sharply electricity demand will climb.
“In very simple terms, a lot of the uncertainty comes from: what is our life going to look like with AI in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years — how integrated is it going to become?” said Maia Leroy, a Sacramento-based advocate who focuses on clean energy and the grid.  “Are we reaching a point where the use is going to plateau, or is it going to continue?”
Experts say more transparency is essential to better understand what resources data centers demand in California.
Liang Min, who manages the Bits and Watts Initiative at Stanford University, says the state should improve its forecasts for energy demand to support clean energy goals. Min, who investigates AI’s growing strain on the electric grid, told CalMatters that demand at power centers rises in rapid, unpredictable phases and can shift quickly with each new generation of hardware.
The California Energy Commission, which plans for energy use and the growth in demand, “can play a pivotal role,” in understanding and adapting to the demands of AI.
As demand grows, policy responses lag
In Sacramento, efforts to add transparency and guardrails around data centers have struggled this year. California lawmakers shelved most consumer and environmental proposals aimed at data centers, even as they approved a plan to regionalize California’s power grid to help meet demand from the sector. They set aside two bills focused on curbing data centers’ energy use — one requiring operators to disclose their electricity use and another that offered clean power incentives.
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a separate proposal that would have required data center operators to report their water use, even after the bill was weakened. In the end, Newsom — who has often highlighted California’s dominance in the artificial intelligence sector — signed only one measure, allowing regulators to determine whether data centers are driving up costs.
Mark Toney, who leads The Utility Reform Network and supported the transparency measure, has questioned whether data centers justify the costs they’re pushing onto ratepayers.
He warned of the centers’ “voracious consumption of energy and water, increased carbon emissions, and jacking up ratepayer bills.”
Hard facts about data centers are tough to find in California because most rent out power, cooling and floor space to other companies, said Ren, the UC Riverside researcher. Such colocation facilities don’t run their own servers or technology, so they report less information publicly than data centers built by major tech companies in other states.
While estimates vary, California has the third-most data centers in the country, after Texas and Virginia. DataCenterMap, a commercial directory that tracks data centers worldwide, lists 321 sites across the state. More in California are expected in coming years.
The centers operate around the clock and often rely on diesel backup generators to maintain service during power failures — a practice that adds both greenhouse gases and local air pollutants. They also consume energy and water depending on their cooling methods.
Rising data-center demand, and rising questions
F. Noel Perry, the businessman and philanthropist who founded Next 10, said his organization’s report shines light on what is fundamentally a black box. “To solve a problem, we have to understand what the problem is,” he said. 
“We’ve seen the proliferation of data centers in California, in the U.S. and across the world — and we also are seeing major implications for the environment,” Perry told CalMatters. “The real issue has to do with transparency — and the ability of elected officials and regulators to create some rules that will govern reductions in emissions, water consumption.”
The report estimated that data centers used 10.8 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023, up from 5.5 terawatt-hours in 2019, accounting for 6% of the nation’s total data center energy use. Unless growth is curbed or better managed, the report’s authors project demand could rise to as high as 25 terawatt-hours by 2028, equal to the power use of roughly 2.4 million U.S. homes.
Carbon emissions from the sector nearly doubled during the same period, climbing from 1.2 million to 2.4 million tons, researchers estimated, while on site water use grew from 1,078 acre feet in 2019 to 2,302 acre feet in 2023. That’s enough to meet the annual water needs of almost seven thousand California households.
The report’s authors also estimated the public health costs from air pollution associated with data centers have potentially risen, from $45 million in 2019 to more than $155 million in 2023, with the burden expected to reach as high as $266 million by 2028.
Most of those costs stem from indirect pollution produced by fossil-fueled power plants that supply the grid. But authors pointed out that regions dense with data centers — particularly Santa Clara County, home to Silicon Valley — could face higher localized risks from diesel backup generators.
Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, said the report exaggerates the impact of backup diesel generators, which are tightly regulated and rarely used in California, minimizing their contributions to air pollution. Data centers don’t control the water used in electricity generation, said Diorio. Since those water impacts don’t happen on site, it’s not fair to blame that on the centers themselves. 
“It paints a skewed picture of this critical 21st-century industry,” Diorio said in a statement.
Diorio said the report also overlooks how cooling technology varies by region and has become more efficient in recent years.
But the authors say their findings underscore the need for uniform reporting standards for data centers’ energy and water use. The report said California should establish ongoing local monitoring and review of data centers — and make the findings public.
Ren, the UC Riverside researcher, said that California’s cleaner grid and stricter pollution rules are helping blunt some environmental impacts of data centers already.
“California — versus the national average — is doing a better job due to the cleaner grid,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110625-Data-Center-San-Jose-BH-Reuters-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

What will California’s next governor do about health care? Four Democrats in the race say answering the Trump Administration’s cuts and making care affordable is important. But they disagree about how to pay for that. 



Every day, Californians struggle to afford medications or wait weeks or months for mental health appointments. Thousands in the “sandwich generation” juggle caring for elderly parents with raising children. 
Those are top health care issues Californians want to see the next governor address, according to a recent poll. The candidates vying to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom offered views on them – and addressed the Trump administration’s coming cuts to safety net programs – at a recent forum at UC Riverside organized by philanthropic foundations. 
“The reality is too many Californians face barriers to health and wellness in our state,” said Richard Tate, president and CEO of the California Wellness Foundation, one of the organizations sponsoring the event. He said the forum was planned to take place in the Inland Empire, where residents experience some of the largest disparities in health outcomes. 
Four candidates, all Democrats, took part in the forum. Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former State Controller Betty Yee all agreed that state response to federal cuts will require them to push for efficiency in the health care system – and look for new sources of revenue. They disagreed on how to fund the state’s response.  
To better understand the health care issues in the nascent gubernatorial race, CalMatters also reached out to frontrunners not in attendance: former Congresswoman Katie Porter, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News Host Steve Hilton. All three polled well in a recent California Wellness Foundation survey. None of them returned interview requests or answered questions about their health policy priorities or vision by the deadline. 
Becerra touts experience standing up to Trump
If elected, Becerra pledges to be the state’s “health care governor” — a title that Gov. Gavin Newsom also often embraced. 
Becerra, 67, touted his experience responding to a public health emergency and negotiating lower drug prices in President Biden’s cabinet. He did so for medications such as blood thinners, diabetes drugs and others as part of a Medicare drug negotiation program. And as a former state Attorney General, he sued the previous Trump administration 123 times. He positioned himself as a strong opponent to federal cutbacks to health. 
“We will not take a knee to what Donald Trump has done to health care,” Becerra said. “We will not go backwards.”
An estimated 3.4 million Californians will lose coverage as a result of the Trump administration’s cuts to the Medicaid program as approved in this year’s federal spending plan. And if Congress does not renew the enhanced premium subsidies for the Affordable Care Act by the end of year, another 400,000 who buy health plans through Covered California could be priced out. 
Filling those gaps is a tall order for the state, but he said it is worth reviewing the tax code to make sure billionaires are paying their fair share to help fund the safety net. 
“We can be rational when it comes to our tax book. But then let’s put the money where it should be on health care,” Becerra said. “I can tell you right now, there is too much money being misspent.” 
That’s because spending should be prioritized on preventive care and on keeping people well in the first place, he said.
“We need to provide for (people) at the front door, not in the emergency room.”
Thurmond floats single-payer system for California 
Among Thurmond’s boldest visions is that of creating a state-run single-payer system, where a public entity handles health care financing – acting as insurer, paying providers, and covering medical costs for all. That’s an idea once floated by Newsom, but abandoned because of its expense and complexity. 
Thurmond, 57, says his support of a single payer system stems from watching his brother die from a rare liver disease. His brother couldn’t afford health insurance, he said, and stopped going to the doctor even though he was sick. 
But a system like that would take years to set up, hundreds of billions of dollars and would also require federal approval. 
More immediately Thurmond said he’d seek legislation to expand requirements for employers to provide quality health care to their workers. “We have many employers in this state who require their employees to get health care through public assistance. And if you do that as an employer you’re going to be held to account,” Thurmond said. “On the flipside…If you’re doing the right thing we’ll reward you with tax credits.”
Like Becerra, Thurmond also supports the idea of taxing the wealthy to increase funding for health care. 
If elected, Thurmond pledged to work with Congress to restore the cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs that the Trump administration made in its most recent federal spending plan.
Villaraigosa: ‘Focus on the basics’
Villaraigosa, 72, says he wants to go back to basics. In a state budget, that means prioritizing public safety, health care and education, in that order, he said. 
Villaraigosa pitches himself as more pragmatic than his opponents. He doesn’t support a single-payer system; he argues that it’s unrealistic because the state can’t afford the upfront costs and because the Trump administration, which would need to approve such plans, would reject it.

State response to a federal administration that is gutting the safety net, he said, will require innovative solutions and a health care system that is more efficient — what exactly that would look like is to be determined.
“I’m not going to sell you snake oil. It is going to be tough to provide that care, but I’m absolutely committed to it,” Villaraigosa said. 
Alone among forum participants, Villaraigosa was less interested in increasing taxes to create more revenue, sidestepping the question and only saying that he’d like to look for ways to “grow the pie.”
“We already have the highest taxes in the United States of America and the highest cost of living,” he said.
But like his opponents, Villaraigosa said he wants to grow the mental health workforce — to do so, you have to incentivize people with adequate pay, he said. “The issue is access because people can’t get a doctor to give them care when they get seven bucks for that visit,” he said.
Yee wants strict accountability
Betty Yee, a 68-year-old former State Controller, wants to be an accountability governor. 
Like her opponents, Yee listed improving mental health access as a high priority. Part of the reason Californians struggle to find appropriate care, she said, is because regulatory agencies aren’t robustly enforcing the state’s mental health parity law, which requires insurers to cover physical and mental health conditions equally.
“We are not looking at our health systems in terms of whether they are continuing to build a robust provider network to deal with mental health for our diverse populations,” Yee said. “So we actually need some better oversight with respect to what is currently the law here in California.” 
Yee is an advocate for growing what’s working. Anti-poverty programs, such as the earned income tax credit and the young child tax credit, have been successful in putting extra dollars in the pockets of low-income Californians, Yee says. She says she’d like to be “bolder” with these refundable tax credit programs and expand them to help alleviate some of the financial burden for caregivers, especially those in the sandwich generation.
Yee said California cannot replace federal cuts with borrowing alone; she supports raising taxes for the highest earners to fund the safety net.
“But before we do that,” Yee said, “I want to be sure we’re making the case that we’re making our health care system much more efficient, and that we really are going to have a much better shot at increasing access and affordability for Californians.”

The report card measures academic achievement, academic growth, graduation rate, progress in English learner proficiency, chronic absenteeism and college and career readiness. 
According to the state report card, academic achievement decreased slightly, from 97.13 in 2023-24 to 97.08 — out of a possible 100 points — in 2024-25. 
“I think the first report card we gave out was a low B, and so what it shows is that if you tell people what you need them to do and you give them the resources to do it, they’re going to come through,” Mackey said.
The percentage of students ranked proficient in English Language Arts increased from 52.8% in 2023-24 to 56.2% in 2024-25. Proficiency in math also increased, from 31.2% to 33.4%. Science proficiency fell slightly, from 39% to 38.9%.
The percentage of Black and Hispanic students showing ELA proficiency increased significantly. For Black students, ELA proficiency went from 36.6% in 2023-24 to 40.2% in 2024-25. For Hispanic students, proficiency went from 40.6% to 44.2%.
Marcus Vandiver, the accountability program coordinator for the Alabama State Department of Education, said scores across the state have improved.
“We’ve actually increased the number of A’s and B’s, and decreased C’s, D’s and F’s,” he said. “So not only is Dr. Mackey and his team doing a great job, but our staff and our sections are doing a great job with our schools and the systems,” he said to board members.
The state also saw chronic absenteeism decrease going from 14.84% during the 2023-24 school year to 12.05% for the 2024-25 school year.
Mackey also said the state has seen a “record number of third graders reading on grade level.”
In June, the State Department of Education saw 11.6% of students who took the ACAP fall below the benchmark during the 2024-25 school year, an improvement from the 13% of students who were below the “cut-off” score in the 2023-24 school year.
The percentage of economically disadvantaged students in state public schools fell from 64.7% in 2023-24 to 58.1% in 2024-25.

,California,2025-11-14 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s gas price crusade morphs into bid to keep refiners open,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/newsoms-gas-price-crusade-refiners/,"A study Gov. Gavin Newsom commissioned describes higher margins oil refiners receive for their products, which become gasoline.","Earlier this week, I pulled my 24-year-old SUV into a Sacramento gas station for its weekly — more or less—  fill-up. It was 14.5 gallons at $4.05, plus the ever-mysterious 9/10 of a cent, per gallon.
I could have gone to a nearby Chevron station, but it wanted $4.59 a gallon and would have cost me about 8 bucks more.
While California’s gas prices are among the nation’s highest, thanks largely to the state’s hefty taxes and regulatory costs, they vary widely from station to station, even among those under the same ownership.
This variance complicates the obsession that California’s motorists and politicians have with gas prices.
California’s nearly 30 million cars and light trucks travel 340 billion miles each year and burn more than 13 billion gallons of gas, costing $60.7 billion in 2024. That’s a big number, certainly, but not a huge factor compared to other costs of living in California, particularly for housing.
Gas prices get so much attention, one suspects, because filling the tank is a frequent ritual that requires drivers to stand there while the pump’s dial spins through gallonage and dollars.
Gov. Gavin Newsom spent much of 2023 and 2024 on a crusade against high gas prices, accusing refiners of gouging motorists. He called a special legislative session and signed legislation to create more oversight.
“They continue to lie, and they continue to manipulate,” Newsom said exactly one year ago. “They have been raking in unprecedented profits because they can.”
Last month, the newly created Division of Petroleum Market Oversight released its first annual report.
There weren’t any smoking guns. Mostly the report merely confirmed what was already known — that prices are much higher than those in other states, that most of the price differential is due to taxes and regulatory costs and that there’s a “mystery surcharge” that cannot be attributed to any quantifiable factor — a phenomenon first identified eight years ago by UC-Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein.
The surcharge has averaged 41 cents a gallon in recent years, and the report declares that “the cumulative impact of this surcharge is substantial, costing California consumers over $59 billion in extra payments for gasoline between 2015 and 2024.”
It suggests that it represents extra profit for refiners but is not definitive. It also acknowledges that “certain refiners, however, may only be marginally profitable outside of price spikes. This is partly because refiners’ operating expenses in California and the West Coast, while generally stable since 2014, are higher than in the rest of the U.S, in part because of higher labor and energy costs.”
In other words the surcharge could just reflect that doing business in California is more expensive than in other states.
“This is validation that Californians have been getting hosed at the pump for decades because too few refiners make too much of our gasoline,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, which had backed Newsom’s crusade.
Having only a few refiners does contribute to the price picture, as does the state’s unique smog-fighting gasoline formula and the lack of pipelines to import fuel from other states.
In fact, after Newsom’s legislation passed, two refiners announced plans to shut down, leading to speculation that gas prices could hike to record levels due to shrinking supplies.
One might have expected that Newsom would jump upon the report as validation of his price-gouging accusations. But the report didn’t make that conclusion, and the governor has since changed his tune and is trying to stave off refinery closures.
Newsom also is drawing fire from Court, who complains that the “Newsom Administration took off the table valuable tools to combat this price gouging when it froze the price gouging penalty rules that it asked the legislature to create in 2023.”
That was then. This is now.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/082825-Gas-Prices-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C687&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-14 08:56:13.985169

KC’s transit agency is concerned that if buses or the streetcar are overwhelmed with tourists, that could impact bus service for the city’s residents (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).The World Cup is just seven months away, and the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority faces the immense challenge of moving hundreds of thousands of fans around Kansas City next summer.
Now, the transit agency has decided to crack open its piggy bank.
For years, transit leaders have asked Kansas, Missouri and the federal government for financial support during the World Cup to manage massive crowds of fans who will travel to the region without cars.
But they have not received a dime for World Cup bus service. So the KCATA is planning to raid millions of dollars from a federal grant from 2018 intended to buy new buses. Instead, that money will be spent on 40 days of expanded service for fans and tourists.
Chuck Ferguson, the chief operations officer for the KCATA, asked the Mid-America Regional Council to approve the change at a committee meeting on Nov. 10.
“We — Johnson County, the Unified Government — have been pushing local, regional and the feds for some kind of dedicated funding for transit for the last few years to no avail,” Ferguson said. “So now we’re scrambling.”
The federal government created a $625 million grant program for safety and security in World Cup cities. But none of that money can be used by transit agencies.
Ferguson told The Beacon that Missouri also provided some support with an “ambassador” program, which will pay people to be “wayfinders” to help visitors find bus stops at World Cup events. But again, that money can’t be used to pay for additional bus routes or operators.
In the absence of additional support, the KCATA is being asked to manage unprecedented numbers of bus riders in Kansas City with a budget that’s already spread thin. And that exposes funding challenges that the KCATA was already facing before the World Cup was even announced.
 Kansas City’s Fan Fest problem

KC2026, the organizing committee formed to raise funds for and manage the World Cup, announced earlier this year that it plans to lease 200 buses to get visitors between the airport, downtown and the six matches planned to be hosted at Arrowhead Stadium.
“KC2026 is currently planning to fund and operate all transportation required to meet the Host City obligations, as well as additional services to facilitate movement in the region,” a spokesperson for KC2026 said in an email statement. “This includes the 200 buses we have leased, as well as any event-specific services that may be provided by partners.”
But transportation leaders are still staring down a problem — getting fans to and from the FIFA Fan Festival on the south lawn of the National World War I Museum and Memorial.
The World War I Museum sits along the newly extended streetcar line, which theoretically could move fans to and from the festival. But anyone who attended the recent Chappell Roan concerts or the NFL Draft in 2023 will remember long wait times to board the streetcar when tens of thousands of people left the venue at the end of the night.
Chappell Roan fans wait for the KC Streetcar following her Oct. 3 concert. The concert was attended by about 30,000 people, which roughly compares to the expected attendance of Fan Fest (Josh Merchant/The Beacon).
Transportation planners call that a “crush load” — when people are packed shoulder-to-shoulder in the train and a long line of passengers has to wait for the next ride.
“The big worry right now,” Ferguson said at the MARC committee meeting, “is between 25,000 and 35,000 people leaving that venue at one point in time and looking to go somewhere.”
The streetcar, he said, can only handle a fraction of that number — a few thousand per hour.
KC2026 is planning to host the Fan Fest for 18 nights next summer — on the day of every Kansas City or Team USA match. But if the public transit along Main Street is overwhelmed that frequently, transit leaders worry it could be catastrophic for public safety and for the city’s reputation during the World Cup.
So the plan is to repurpose about $2.1 million that the KCATA received in 2018 to purchase new energy efficient buses. Instead, the agency will spend it on operations during the World Cup to run some extra buses along the streetcar line to manage the flood of fans. Another $387,500 would come from the Prospect MAX grant.
That would fund overtime pay for bus operators and the extra fuel.
“It’s not going to be the massive amounts of service that people had originally envisioned,” Ferguson told the committee. “But it is one dedicated opportunity that we hope to put out there.”
Johnson County Transit made a similar request at the Nov. 10 meeting, except it would use $2.1 million to bolster bus lines to hotels like the Sheraton in Overland Park.
In both cases, if the extra buses are not needed, the money will not be spent and it will be returned to the fund, likely to pay for the new efficient buses as originally intended.
 KCATA is expected to do more with the same budget

Ultimately, the MARC transportation and emissions committee voted to recommend the change for approval by the entire board later this year.
But there were some dissenters, including Eric Rogers, the executive director and cofounder of BikeWalkKC. Rogers was one of three “no” votes.
He voted that way because he’s concerned about sacrificing long-term transit investments — like buses that could last for 25 years — for the sake of solving a short-term problem at the World Cup.
But he remains frustrated that the KCATA is expected to provide transit service for an unprecedented event in Kansas City without any funding from FIFA or from state or federal partners.
“We are putting our transit agencies in a tough position,” he said. “My question is, ‘Why isn’t the event that’s creating all of this demand doing more to provide the funding that’s needed for the transit agency to respond to the demand?’”
That concern was echoed by several other members of the committee during the meeting, including some who voted yes.
Bailey Waters, the chief mobility officer at Kansas City, asked Ferguson if FIFA was providing any support for the planned World Cup events.
“FIFA is not, never was going to sponsor anything,” Ferguson said in response. “FIFA requires things. But really all that FIFA provides is the happiness that we get to host the World Cup.”
Kansas City Councilmember Eric Bunch, who also serves on the KCATA Board of Commissioners, supports the move to repurpose the green bus funds for World Cup operations. But he said the frustration with FIFA is not lost on him.
“That is the problem with major events like the World Cup, like the Olympics, like the DNC or the RNC,” he said. “They’re pitching this as a positive economic impact. And in the end, it’s the local governments that pick up the bill often, and it’s the local residents who are impacted by it.”
 A fundamental funding challenge

Bunch said this most recent situation is emblematic of ongoing funding issues at the KCATA.
Not only is the transit agency underfunded in the Kansas City area, but its biggest financial constraints are around operating costs, rather than buying new buses.
In other words, the KCATA does not tend to have problems paying for new buses. The issue is finding money to pay the drivers and mechanics or buying fuel.
That’s because the federal government is willing to give grants for “capital” like new buses or streetcar tracks, but it is much rarer for the KCATA to get grants that can be used for “operations.”
(The Trump administration has deprioritized public transit as a whole compared to the Biden administration.)
“The federal government basically says, ‘All right, we’ll help you build your transit system, we’ll buy buses, we’ll build tracks for streetcars and light rail,’” Bunch said. “But once it’s up and running, that’s (the city’s) responsibility.”
About 72% of the KCATA’s operations — $61 million out of total $85 million — are paid for by Kansas City Hall.
So if the KCATA can find a way to use the federal grants to pay bus operators during the World Cup, Bunch said, that’s a far more appealing option than tapping an already strained operations budget.
Tristin Amezcua-Hogan, the chair of the Regional Transit Alliance, told The Beacon in an email statement that the KCATA is “trapped in a cycle of poverty right now that is perpetuated by a lack of stable regional funding.”
“This is just one of the many instances of the organization having to choose what gets the job done over the optimal decision that would come out of consistent funding,” he said.
Some members of the MARC committee, including Westwood City Administrator Leslie Herring, believe that the positive side of the World Cup is that some Kansas Citians are going to be taking public transit for the first time to get to the Fan Fest.
“It might be an opportunity to expand who all in Kansas City actually feels comfortable riding the buses,” Herring said at the committee meeting. “When Mission would take residents down to the Plaza, in Westport, to go bar hop during the holiday season, that was one of my first times on a bus. And I feel very comfortable on KCATA buses now.”
In theory, that kind of public support from new bus riders could pay off in the future if a regional transit sales tax is placed on the ballot.
A sales tax has some support in the Jackson County Courthouse, and four out of five of the Unified Government commissioners elected earlier this month told The Beacon that they would support putting a similar measure on the ballot in Wyandotte County.
Bunch said polling shows the majority of voters in Jackson, Johnson, Clay and Wyandotte counties already support raising taxes to fund public transit. And that could increase if the KCATA does a good job during the World Cup.
“That is the opportunity we have with the World Cup, and enhancing bus service during that time,” he said. “That more people are going to be willing to try it out. And I think that that’s a really good thing.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)First freeze dates across South Dakota are trending later in the year, which has lengthened the growing season while prolonging risks from weeds, pests and wildfires.
According to an October report on first freeze dates since 1970 from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists and communicators focused on climate change, the first freeze is arriving 12 days later in Sioux Falls, 13 days later in Mitchell and seven days later in Rapid City. Statewide, the trend is 1.4 days later per decade based on county data, according to a Midwestern Regional Climate Center freeze date tool.
The trend is “obvious” in Sioux Falls, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Chapman. Of the top 25 latest first freeze dates in Sioux Falls since 1893, 10 of them are within the last 17 years.
The changes are consistent with what 1990s climate models projected regarding the effects of rising human-caused atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane, said State Climatologist Laura Edwards. Those same models projected continued warming in the coming decades.
“When you look at fall, winter and spring, you’re seeing these accelerated warming temperatures,” Edwards said. “You don’t have to go as far north as Alaska to see the impact of warming temperatures.”


Changing climate extends South Dakota growing season
South Dakota’s growing season extended more than 18 days from the late 1800s through 2023, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s a longer extension than Iowa and Nebraska, but a shorter extension than North Dakota and Minnesota, at 32 and 21 days, respectively.

South Dakota farmers are expected to harvest over 1 billion bushels of corn this year — the largest amount in state history — due in part to longer growing seasons, Edwards said.
Northeast and north-central South Dakota are warming faster than other parts of the state. Marshall County is reporting a trend in its first fall freeze of 2.9 days later per decade. Spink County reports 2.7 days later per decade, and Brown and Day counties 2.6 days later per decade.
Western South Dakota has drier conditions, which means the air heats and cools faster than more humid or moist air. Edwards said those conditions likely factor into slower trending first frost dates in northwestern counties compared to northeastern counties.
Edwards said the changing climate allows South Dakota farmers to rethink their planting strategy. If their crop insurance allows, they could plant earlier than normal. Farmers could also adopt hybrid corn crops that work well in Iowa and Nebraska, since South Dakota’s climate is becoming more like those two states, which are some of the top corn producers in the nation.
Wildfire risk, pests and weeds are trade-offs to longer growing season
Darren Clabo, state wildfire meteorologist and South Dakota Mines associate professor, said later first freezes delay the fall grassfire season into November. Winter and fall are typically the driest times of the year in the state.
When temperatures are above average and conditions are dry in the early fall and into the winter, Clabo said, there is an elevated risk of fire.
“If the grass isn’t covered by snow this time of year, we have to be extremely careful with our ignition sources and ensure we aren’t the cause of wildfires,” Clabo said.
Along with changes in wildfire risks, later frost dates contribute to increased nuisances like pests and weeds, Edwards said.
Insects such as grasshoppers require a “killing frost” to lessen their grip, Edwards said, and just a couple of extra weeks without a frost ushers in another generation of the short-lived insect.

Mosquito season is also extended, which can increase risks from West Nile virus and other diseases carried by the insect. Eric Jones, South Dakota State University Extension weed management specialist, said there are less diverse, more persistent weeds throughout the state due in part to herbicide use, but later first freeze dates “don’t do us any favors.” The later freeze allows weeds to last longer and produce more seeds to deal with next year. That increases input costs for farmers to control them.
“There might be only one weed left, but it’s got 100 seeds,” Jones said. “Your problem with just one weed became 100 for next year.”
A common fall allergy comes from ragweed pollen. Those ragweed allergies tend to stop as the plants die with frost.
But if the frost doesn’t come as early, the plant has a longer time to flower and pollinate, “extending the season of sniffles,” Jones said.

The first freeze is arriving 13 days later in Mitchell, 12 days later in Sioux Falls and seven days later in Rapid City, according to a report from Climate Central.

The district covers southeastern Chambers County and most of eastern Lee County in east Alabama. It was held by Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, until she resigned this summer to move near the Florida panhandle, where her husband works. 
In October, voters narrowed their choice to stay-at-home-mom Kristin Nelson and peanut farmer Garrett Dixon. Kristin Nelson received 1,226 (46.69%) votes in Tuesday’s GOP primary for House District 38, according to unofficial results from the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office. Garrett Dixon received 874 (33.28%) votes. Micah Messer, who ran for the seat in 2022, got 526 (20.03%) votes.

Nelson, 41, is advocating for a flat state income tax rate, which can only be done through a constitutional amendment. The current 2-5% rates, as well as the income thresholds for them, were set by a 1933 constitutional amendment. Nelson also wants all schools to have a resource officer on campus.
Nelson in an interview Monday cited her lifelong work in the district, including activity at Fairfax Methodist Church and involvement in multiple clubs and organizations in the community.
“It didn’t start just when I began to seek office,” Nelson said. “I just truly have a servant’s heart to be able to serve this district, give back to the people who have built me and raised me.”
Dixon, 34, said in an interview Wednesday that he wants to recruit “good paying” jobs to the district, improve infrastructure and support public schools. 
“We have to make sure that the next generation continues to have opportunities here, and if they don’t, they’ll find somewhere else to find those opportunities,” Dixon said. “That’s just the reality of it.”
Messer endorsed Dixon after the primary on social media. Nelson said the endorsement has not affected her campaign. However, she said it has been harder to get in front of Messer’s voters due to the physical distance between Lannett and Smiths Station. Lannett, where Nelson lives, is in the northern part of the district and Smiths Station, where Messer lives, is in the southern portion.
“That’s been a little difficult, just because it probably is the most rural portion of the district, and so not having huge community events and things to attend has been difficult,” Nelson said. 
Dixon said the endorsement has helped him reach new voters. He said voters should choose him because he is facing the same issues they are.
“I tell people that I’m just an average guy. My wife is a school teacher, I’m a farmer. I work every day in this district,” Dixon said. “I run up and down the same roads that we all agree need paving, and I know how expensive things are at the grocery store. All of these issues that we face in House District 38, I’m right there with them.”
The winner of the primary runoff will face Democratic candidate Hazel Floyd, 21, on Feb. 3. Floyd is campaigning on boosting business development beyond Valley city limits, strengthening public education funding and supporting farmers.

Campaign finances

According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $91,000 and spent almost $74,000. About two-thirds of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth donated $10,000 to Dixon’s campaign, according to records. 
Nelson has raised over $60,000 and spent almost $51,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. Most of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses.

(Stock photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Putting more medical care on wheels. Converting vacated buildings. Encouraging doctors and doctors-in-training to work in rural South Carolina.
Those are among the possibilities for up to $1 billion flowing to South Carolina over the next five years through the $50 billion federal Rural Health Transformation Program.
“It’s a massive amount of funding,” Eunice Medina, director of the state Department of Health and Human Services, told the SC Daily Gazette. “It’s truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the state.”
Exactly how much will be available for health care in rural South Carolina won’t be known until late December, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will announce states’ awards. In the meantime, South Carolina health officials want providers to get their proposals ready.
“We want to stay on a schedule and get those grants awarded and money to flow into the system,” Medina said.
Her agency is hosting a webinar Tuesday to explain the state’s 60-page application to providers, advocates, and anyone else who’s interested. The state agency can keep a maximum of 10% of its total award for administration. The rest will be doled out as grants for initiatives that fall into five general categories — what Medina calls “buckets.”
All are about “creating more services, more providers, more overall access” with improvements that carry on once the federal money runs out, without putting state taxes on the hook, she said.
Prohibited uses of the one-time money include salaries. But grants can be used to pay signing bonuses or pay off student loans for doctors who move to or do their specialty training in rural areas.
“Once you’re there, we want you to fall in love and stay,” said Medina, who’s been visiting agency offices statewide since becoming director a year ago.
And while the money can’t construct a new building, it can pay to refurbish an abandoned space for patients. It can also buy mobile doctors’ offices.
“If you’re trying to expand mobile health units that go out to schools, and you just need the cost of the van and equipment — done,” Medina said. “Let’s do that, as long as they have a sustainability plan.”
South Carolina is seeking $1 billion total from the program created by Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law signed July 4 by President Donald Trump. Congress created it in response to concern about how the law would impact rural providers.
Every state is automatically eligible for $100 million annually through 2030 for applying by the Nov. 5 deadline — which every state did. Decisions on divvying up the other $25 billion will be based on states’ ruralness — South Carolina ranks 35th — their plans for the money, and their existing laws and policies.
For example, Medina said, South Carolina will get credit for the 2023 law repealing the Certificate of Need regulatory permission process for hospitals. And the state will score major points for aligning with the Trump administration’s “make America healthy again” initiative by banning the purchase of candy, sodas and other sugary drinks with federal food assistance. (With the federal government reopened, official approval of the state’s request, submitted in late September, could be imminent.)
Other policies in South Carolina’s favor include state support for telehealth and participation in regulatory agreements that allow nurses, emergency medical personnel, and psychologists to work across state lines, according to the health agency.
Rural challenges
The program could be a huge boon for poor, rural parts of South Carolina, health association leaders said.
While it is overseen by the state agency that runs Medicaid, which provides health coverage to more than 1 million poor South Carolinians, it is not Medicaid, Medina stressed. Rather, it’s supposed to improve access for rural South Carolinians whether they’re covered by Medicaid or not, she said.
Roughly a third of the state’s population lives in rural areas with limited access to health care.
In 2021, there were nine doctors for every 10,000 people in rural counties, compared to 28 doctors per 10,000 people in urban areas, according to the 2024 Health Professions Data Book, compiled by the South Carolina Area Health Education Consortium. It shows that more than two-thirds of all doctors statewide were concentrated in six of the state’s 46 counties: Charleston, Greenville, Richland, Horry, Spartanburg, and York.
Eight rural counties didn’t have a single pediatrician. Fifteen lacked an OB-GYN; 17 lacked a psychiatrist, according to the latest data book.
“This could be one of the greatest blessings the state has ever had,” said Terri Jowers, executive director of the state Community Health Workers Association.
Her group was among providers submitting more than 350 proposals that helped the state health agency craft its application. Providers will still need to officially apply for a grant, which will be a contract with the state. The webinar will include an explanation of the grant cycle.
Jowers’ group plans to ask for money to connect doctors with health workers who may go into people’s homes and live in their community. The workers can provide valuable insight to assist patients’ medical care and increase their likelihood of returning for check-ups.
“How can we weave these together to really take care of our patients and our communities and help everybody live healthier lives?” Jowers said.
Better coordination among health care providers could also help improve access to care, she said.
One of the category “buckets” for the money is using technology to create “connections to care.” That can include tying rural hospitals and other providers into an electronic health records system.
If doctors can go online to see patients’ medical history with other providers, treatment could become faster, easier and cheaper, Jowers said.
Rural hospitals’ requests include partnerships with the state’s technical colleges, as well as loan repayment and forgiveness programs, to grow the health care workforce, said Karlin Gill, spokesperson for the South Carolina Hospital Association.
Supporting small hospitals will be especially important as Medicaid rates decrease over the coming years. The program won’t fill all the gaps from that loss, she said.
“There are huge benefits” to the program, Gill said. “That amount is not a small amount. But I don’t think it will cover everything that will be affected as we see those reimbursement cuts year over year.”
In 2028, South Carolina will start losing its ability to pay hospitals for treating Medicaid patients at similar rates as private insurance through what’s known as the state directed payment program, which the law signed in July phases out. South Carolina has used it since 2023 to hike Medicaid payments to hospitals by a whopping 70% on average.
For the 60 general care hospitals in the Palmetto State, that collectively means a looming loss of roughly $150 million annually over 15 years, according to the hospital association.
South Carolina is among 10 states that never expanded Medicaid coverage to all adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as intended under the 2010 law commonly known as Obamacare. For that reason, other Medicaid changes in Republicans’ tax policy package don’t apply to the Palmetto State.
But the state also has a higher percentage of uninsured residents, giving hospitals much less wiggle room to absorb the impact of payment reductions.
And the number of uninsured will rise with the Dec. 31 expiration of enhanced federal subsidies for people buying private insurance through the online marketplace created by the 2010 law. The enhanced subsidies, initially approved by Congress during the pandemic, save South Carolinians between $500 and $700 monthly on premiums.
Losing that will make health insurance too expensive for many, which will also impact providers, said Maya Pack, director of the South Carolina Institute of Medicine and Public Health, a nonpartisan research organization.
“I don’t know that this fund will be able to offset all of the more negative outcomes that could be triggered by those things, but it will certainly help to mitigate that,” Pack said.
How much the program helps will depend on what the state health agency decides to fund, she said.
Another “bucket” for grants is called “leveling up,” which means expanding successful pilot programs.
“We have a lot of great programs in our state that meet the needs of rural residents as well as urban residents, but oftentimes, those programs or services are isolated to one community or one county,” Pack said.



Goals for SC’s award
South Carolina’s Rural Health Transformation plan consists of five general categories. Providers will apply for grants that fund the following initiatives:

Connections to care: Using technology to connect providers and patients. Examples include telehealth services and electronic health records.
Leveling up: Taking successful pilot projects statewide that focus on chronic disease management, improving children’s health and growing the workforce.
Wellness within reach: Bringing care directly to communities with mobile health units, crisis response teams and pop-up clinics.
Shoring up to sustainability: Investments that recruit, train and retain health care workers, and upgrade existing buildings.
Tech catalyst fund: Funding for innovative, startup health companies

Environmental stewardship and respect for Vermonters must go hand in hand.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rural caucus leaders: Vermonters deserve notice and a fair voice in land-use decisions.","This commentary is by Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover; Rep. Lisa Hango, R-Berkshire; Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford; and Rep. Lucy Boyden, D-Cambridge.


Vermont is undergoing the most significant land-use regulation update in over 50 years. As Tier 2 and Tier 3 mapping and rulemaking under Act 181 of 2024 move forward, decisions are being made right now that will affect how Vermonters access their homes, and live on, build on and use their land. These decisions will shape our communities and our landscape for generations.
Yet many Vermonters who will be directly affected do not know what this will mean for their property. The only parcels not facing increased Act 250 jurisdiction compliance and financial pressure are those that are able to meet the Tier 1 requirements. This means most Vermont homeowners, landowners, and working land stewards will be touched by this process for designating automatic Act 250 jurisdiction.
We lead the rural caucus, a bipartisan coalition of legislators from different political parties and opposite corners of the state focused on policy impacts for Vermont’s rural spaces. We did not all agree on Act 181. But we do agree on this: when the government changes rules that affect use, access and value of your property, Vermonters deserve direct notice and a real chance to participate in an informed way before those changes take effect.
Most Vermonters live outside designated growth centers that qualify as Tier 1. Rural Vermonters have long been stewards of our forests, farms and waters — work that has benefited the entire state.
They own family land and want the next generation to have the same opportunity. They are small business owners, farmers and tradespeople. Vermont’s rural working lands communities already carry much of the responsibility for caring for our landscape. They deserve fairness and clarity as rules change.
We are introducing legislation to do four simple things (you can read a draft of the bill here):

Direct notice: Landowners mapped in Tier 2 and Tier 3 must receive mailed notice before Tier 3 rules are finalized. Vermonters should not find out after the fact that new regulations apply to their home or land.


Meaningful participation: People deserve a real opportunity to understand and comment before decisions affecting their property rights are finalized. Public trust depends on this.
Continued progress on housing: Housing exemptions in previously identified growth areas remain active while this rulemaking process is completed. Our small towns, villages and local employers cannot afford any more uncertainty around the availability of housing.


Fair property valuation: If new rules limit or change how land can reasonably be used, that reality must be considered in tax assessments. Not automatic tax cuts — just ensuring valuation is based on real development potential in light of these changes, beginning with the 2027 grand lists.

This bill does not undo Act 181 or weaken Act 250. It does not slow environmental progress or create loopholes. It makes sure Vermonters are notified and included before location-based rules take effect on their land and roads.
This is not a pause. It is a fairness fix.
Most Vermonters live outside Tier 1 areas and already do the work of caring for our forests, farms, and working lands. They deserve notice and a voice before rules change under their feet.
If you agree, please contact your legislators and ask them to support what we are calling the Rural Notice and Fair Implementation Act.

(Photo by Strekoza2/iStock Editorial/Getty Images Plus)The city of Spokane swung further left in the Nov. 4 election, with progressives capitalizing on apparent dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump to sweep three City Council races.
This gives progressives a 6-1 advantage on the council, whose seats are officially non-partisan. It will also further cement Spokane’s status as an oasis of blue in eastern Washington, a region where the vast majority of elected officials are conservatives. The city is Washington’s second largest, with about 230,000 residents. 
“After the longest week of our lives, today’s count confirmed that we won!” progressive Sarah Dixit, who trailed on election night, wrote on Instagram this week. “I am honored to be your next council member.”
Dixit, on Monday, finally edged out incumbent Jonathan Bingle, who was aligned with the business community. Dixit won by the slimmest of margins, barely surpassing the need for a mandatory recount. 
A pro-choice advocate, Dixit attributed her victory to “divisions happening because of the Trump administration.”
Bingle said he would not challenge the results.
“Life goes on,” he told reporters.
In the other two Spokane City Council races, incumbent Zack Zappone and newcomer Kate Telis won by much larger margins. In a race for an open seat, voters chose Telis over businessman Alejandro Barrientos, who focused on the issues of downtown crime and homelessness.
The city already has a Democratic mayor in Lisa Brown, the former state Senate majority leader.
Dealing with homelessness in the downtown core has consumed Spokane politics for several years, and Brown believes a big reason she beat incumbent Mayor Nadine Woodward in late 2023 was by focusing on other issues.
While acknowledging that homelessness remains a problem, “I want to highlight that all neighborhoods matter,” Brown said.
Cornell Clayton, director of the Thomas S. Foley Institute at Washington State University in Pullman, pointed to two major causes for the progressive sweep of the City Council races.
One is that Democrats are outraged by the actions of Trump and motivated to vote. The other is a nationwide sorting that sees many urban areas turning bluer while rural areas become more conservative.
“The GOP base is somewhat disappointed in Trump,” Clayton said. “The Democrat base is being energized.
“It’s more of a turnout issue,” Clayton said, as opposed to people changing their individual political stripes.
Clayton said Trump’s actions have provoked “existential angst” among Democrats.
At the same time, there is a growing “degree divide” in the country, with more Democrats having college degrees and moving to larger cities in pursuit of better-paying jobs, Clayton said.
“You see this everywhere,” Clayton said. “Even in red states, the urban centers have gone blue.”
Voters also favored more liberal candidates in key local races in Seattle this year, including the election of Katie Wilson, a self-described socialist, as mayor over incumbent Bruce Harrell.
Spokane County, which has about 556,000 residents, contains this urban-rural divide within its own borders. In offices that represent both urban and rural areas, three of the five county commissioners are Republicans, as are six of the nine state legislators.
Shasti Conrad, chair of the state Democratic Party, said numerous other cities in Washington elected progressive candidates, including Longview, Sunnyside and Camas.
“People don’t want the chaos of the Trump administration,” Conrad said.
In Spokane, Dixit beat incumbent Bingle by just 156 votes, with 50.6% of the vote. A recount would occur if the margin shrank to less than a half percentage point.
Dixit, former organizing director for Pro-Choice Washington, called her victory “surreal.” It was the first run for public office for the 2018 graduate of Spokane’s Whitworth University.
“I think it’s really emblematic of how people are responding to what’s happening federally,” Dixit said. “We’re seeing people’s basic rights taken away, healthcare taken away, insurance premiums going up. I think people are doing whatever they can to have local and state governments stand up against the decisions of the Trump administration.”
Dixit’s win left Michael Cathcart as the lone conservative on the seven-member council. Cathcart did not return a message seeking comment.
Bingle said he will keep “lifting up [Cathcart] in my prayers.”
Meanwhile, some people are wondering if Spokane’s leftward shift will undermine the re-election chances of U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, who hails from the city and represents eastern Washington in Congress. Baumgartner easily won his first term in 2024.
“He is out of touch,” said Brown, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2017 and lost to incumbent Republican Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
Clayton said Baumgartner’s prospects for re-election are tied more to short-term factors like the economy and Trump’s popularity.
“If Trump’s popularity continues to wane, and especially if the economy takes a more dramatic turn down next year (as many economists expect), that could have a substantial impact on partisan turnout, with the potential for creating a ‘Blue Wave,’” Clayton wrote in an email. “I think that is the only realistic threat to a Baumgartner re-election.”
The 5th Congressional District, which includes Spokane, has not sent a Democrat to Congress since George Nethercutt defeated House Speaker Tom Foley in a shocking 1994 upset.
Baumgartner defeated Democratic candidate Carmela Conroy last year, winning about 60% of the vote.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/spokane-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 07:56:42.453273

(Getty Images)Indiana’s Commission for Higher Education voted Thursday to keep Frank O’Bannon scholarship awards flat for the 2026-27 academic year, holding the state-funded financial aid program at about $168 million annually.
The decision means roughly 37,000 Hoosier college students who receive the need-based grant each year will see the same maximum and minimum award amounts as in the current cycle.
Commission staff said the flat-line was driven by uncertainty around federal student aid changes and the need to preserve the program’s appropriation without generating unplanned spending overages.
“We’re prioritizing predictability so students can count on the award and we don’t exceed the appropriation,” said Cody Robison, CHE’s deputy chief financial officer.
Changes to scholarship spending
The flat schedule follows years of funding shifts.
In 2022, the commission raised award amounts by 35% to restore pre-Great Recession levels after years of underspending. But subsequent federal changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, and the Student Aid Index unexpectedly drove up eligibility and spending.

Robison said that forced the commission to trim award levels in 2024 to stay within the program’s state appropriation.
In the latest state budget approved by the General Assembly earlier this year, about $77.5 million in accumulated reserves from prior years was reverted to the state’s general fund, leaving the program without a carryover cushion going forward.
State funding for higher education also took a roughly 5% hit in the latest budget cycle, triggered by a grim revenue forecast that projected about $2 billion less in revenues over the biennium. Across the board, state agencies were hit with similar funding reductions.
Previously, CHE was spending about $130 million per year out of the roughly $168 million appropriation for the Frank O’Bannon Grant, with the remainder accumulating in reserves.
New data sheds light on Indiana schools likely most affected by impending cuts to financial aid

But in 2024, the number of Indiana students who qualified for state financial aid jumped after significant changes were made to the federal formula that determines aid eligibility. Commission members kept the awards at the same amount, leading to an unexpected increase to Indiana’s projected spend for the 2025 fiscal year.
That forced CHE to dip into its reserves to cover the inflated costs. Commission staff reported $173 million in Frank O’Bannon awards dispersed in the 2024 fiscal year; $215 million the 2025 fiscal year; and $160 million in the current fiscal year.
Projected scholarship disbursements in the 2027 fiscal year are currently estimated at $157 million. Robison told commissioners that CHE is projecting about 37,000 awards to be issued for 2026-27 academic year, the same as in the current year.
Unused Frank O’Bannon dollars are no longer allowed to rollover into future budget cycles, but any remaining balance at the year’s end can now be transferred to the 21st Century Scholars or Adult Student Grant funds.
Robison said the goal moving forward is to spend “as close as possible” to the Frank O’Bannon program’s full allocation, however.
“We’ll aim to use the full appropriation while not building a hidden reserve,” Robison said.
Award amounts to stay the same
Created in 1969 and later renamed for former Gov. Frank O’Bannon, the grant is Indiana’s primary need-based scholarship for in-state students attending in-state colleges.
It combines two long-running programs: the Higher Education Award, which covers public and proprietary institutions, and the Freedom of Choice Grant for students at private colleges.
Students must be full-time Indiana residents, maintain satisfactory academic progress, and file the FAFSA by April 15 each year to qualify. Those completing at least 24 credit hours earn a full-time award; 30 hours or more qualifies them for the higher “on-time” award.
Together, the Frank O’Bannon programs account for more than 40% of all state-funded student aid, according to the commission.

Award amounts under the 2025-26 schedule ranged widely depending on institution type and student need.
For students at public four-year institutions with the highest demonstrated need and at least 30 credit hours completed, the “on-time” award currently tops at $5,300. Students in their first award year also receive the on-time award amount.
For similar students at private colleges, the top scholarship levels reach $10,600, according to CHE.
At Ivy Tech Community College and smaller proprietary institutions, the top award for the current academic year is about $4,050.
Students receiving the “full-time award” — for completing 24 to 29 credits, rather than 30 or more — the ceiling for the public-institution award falls to about $3,850, while the private institution award is about $7,700 for the 2025-26 schedule.
With the award amounts held flat for the upcoming 2026-27 school year, eligible students will continue to receive financial support in roughly that range, assuming their institution type and credit-completion category remain unchanged.
Commissioner pushes for a stronger message to students
Katie Jenner, who presided Thursday over her first full CHE meeting as both Indiana’s Secretary of Education and the newly-selected CHE commissioner, said the agency will also publish the grant’s funding methodology publicly for the first time in January. The plan, she said, is to invite input from colleges, financial-aid groups and other stakeholders.
“When we put something out transparently, it always ends up better,” Jenner said, adding that the goal is to “make sure we’re spending that money as prudently as possible.”
“We’ll be very transparent about what’s working, what’s not, and make sure every dollar supports the students who need it most,” she continued.
Robison noted that — alongside the 21st Century Scholars Program — the Frank O’Bannon Grant remains a key pillar of the state’s goal to make higher education “accessible and affordable” to all Hoosiers.

Still, Commissioner Dennis Bland said he’d like to see the program’s communications stress that the scholarship represents “an investment,” not a “handout.” He emphasized the “human” impact of the grant and the importance of students understanding the state’s investment in them.
“When people understand that someone has invested in their life and future, they’re more inclined to steward that investment,” Bland said, suggesting the commission or colleges could send students a message reflecting that theme.
He further linked the scholarship to student motivation and retention.
“Investments are being made in your life and the future of your family so that you can grow, develop your skills, return contribution to your family, return contribution to the community,” Bland added. “You’re an outstanding citizen for this state — for the nation. … These are really investments.”
The approved schedule now goes to the State Budget Committee for review in December, as required by state law. After that, the commission will communicate the final award amounts to Indiana’s colleges and universities so financial-aid packages can be prepared early next year.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)When you have covered the Statehouse since 1999, it sometimes feels like being stuck in a time loop. Some issues come back over and over, with no substantive changes in the discussion.
One of my favorites of these arose again last week when key lawmakers came out in support of reducing the number of state boards and commissions. Others though include constant tinkering with “workforce development.” And let’s not forget the endless fight over township government.
But first – back to boards and commissions. Everyone seems to agree we have too many of these ubiquitous government panels — more than 250. These entities cost the state at least $700,000, mostly in per diem, travel and staff costs.
But as soon as you start picking and choosing which ones have to go, people who care about the topic go into fight mode.
When the discussion arose during interim study committees this summer and fall, memories of when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels pitched the same thing in 2006 came flooding back.
“Legislators eager to demonstrate their enthusiasm for some cause or interest group find creating these entities an easy and generally low-cost way to do so,” Daniels said then. “And while these boards and commissions take up only a minute chunk of Indiana’s budget, they devour time, money, and energy far beyond any real contribution they make.”
Some legislators want to slash from Indiana’s 250-plus boards and commissions

He asked legislators to overhaul 300-plus state boards and commissions. Initially he wanted to put a sunset date on every panel so that lawmakers would consider the value of each one in terms of allowing it to continue.
But it took years to make any progress.
Daniels wrote about the effort in a 2012 Atlantic article:
“Progress is not impossible. After years of trying, we have euthanized over 70 of these boards and commissions. My favorite method is to not appoint board or commission members and see if anyone notices. I took a more direct approach in proposing and signing a recent ‘spring cleaning’ bill which took out over 20 entities, including a water shortage task force, a library automation council, and numerous other innocuous-sounding government bodies that rarely meet and whose minimal responsibilities frequently overlap.”
Last year, Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty, introduced a bill that would have eliminated or repealed several boards and commissions. Among them were the Department of Natural Resources’ Advisory Council, the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission, the Indiana Standardbred Advisory Board, the Certification Appeal Board, the Indiana Commission for Arts and Humanities Education, the Law Enforcement Academy Building Commission.
The bill didn’t even get a hearing. And the irony is that the same legislation would have created the Indiana Historical Records Advisory Board.
Bartels and Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, say they will be back at it again in 2026 though they don’t have a specific list of boards and commissions quite yet.
But there are other topics besides boards and commissions that always come back around.
Workforce woes
I don’t think there has been a single year where lawmakers haven’t passed workforce legislation, and I count at least two major overhauls of the workforce development system during my tenure.
And yet we never seem to make improvements. After decades of programs and state spending, businesses still say finding qualified workers is their biggest struggle.
Not enough Hoosiers are going to college or receiving other training or certifications. And Indiana had 135,000 job openings in June 2025. Newer numbers have been delayed by the federal government shutdown.
Township toils
Another issue I have seen cycle through the Legislature numerous times are attempts to eliminate township government. Indiana has 1,008 townships with boards and trustees.
In 2008, about 950 township assessors were abolished after a report on local government reform headed by former Gov. Joe Kernan and then-Chief Justice Randall Shepard rocked the state. It was titled “Streamlining local government. We’ve got to stop governing like this.”
But lawmakers — many of whom came up through local government — have resisted eliminating the level of government closest to the people. The Indianapolis Star recently reported on township spending, and suggested Gov. Mike Braun might support another push against the township structure in 2026.
“All told, Indiana taxpayers spent nearly $20 million on township trustee and board member pay alone in 2024, according to an IndyStar analysis of government salary data, almost as much as the $25 million they doled out in poor relief assistance to residents, which advocates for township government say is the most important thing they do.”
So, it looks like I’ll get to cover another round of debate on township reform right alongside a new effort to purge boards and commissions. It remains to be seen if reporters 20 years from now will get to do it all over again.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A multistate health system is pausing changes to compensation but continuing to ask Duluth physicians to sign a heavily amended contract that includes a noncompete clause barring them from seeking work elsewhere.
Aspirus St. Luke’s push for physicians to sign the amended contract comes even as Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is investigating the noncompete clause, which were banned in Minnesota for contracts after 2023.
An email from Aspirus St. Luke’s, forwarded by two physicians who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, acknowledged the attorney general’s investigation into “proposed amendments to physician contracts and how the amendment might, or might not, impact an underlying non-compete commitment in our employment agreement.”
Aspirus is now pausing changes to compensation and its performance incentive program. Even amid the investigation, however, the company is still asking physicians to sign the amended contract in December — a month after an initial deadline — according to an email sent to physicians from Kim Terhaar, the vice president of ambulatory care.
Physicians previously told the Reformer that they were told that refusal to sign the amendments — which include significant changes to sections on compensation, duties and terminations — would be taken as a resignation.
An author of Minnesota’s 2023 ban on noncompete agreements said the amended contract likely violates the law; although the noncompete ban does not apply to contracts signed before 2023, renewed and amended contracts are considered new contracts.
Still, labor law experts said that it’s unclear how a court might rule. Ellison’s office provided no updates on the investigation.
The amendments are not the first time Aspirus physicians have raised issues with their noncompetes. In October, a family physician sued Aspirus St. Luke’s to be released from the noncompete clause in her contract, arguing that the enforcement of the noncompete would inhibit patient access to primary care in Duluth.
That physician, according to the lawsuit, told Aspirus that she intended to open a direct primary care practice in which patients pay a flat fee for primary care instead of paying through insurance. In response, Aspirus threatened to use her contract’s noncompete to sue her if she proceeded, according to the lawsuit.
Aspirus denied all allegations from the lawsuit and filed a memorandum defending the noncompete. The lawsuit is ongoing.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images).This story was originally published by ProPublica.
The beneficiaries of President Donald Trump’s mercy in his second term have mostly been people with access to the president or his inner circle. Those who have followed the rules set out by the Department of Justice, meanwhile, are still waiting.
Trump has granted clemency to allies, donors and culture-war figures — as well as felons who, like him, were convicted of financial wrongdoing. On Friday, he granted pardons to 77 people, including Rudy Giuliani and other allies tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election, though they are mostly symbolic because federal pardons do not apply to ongoing or possible state prosecutions, which many of the grantees face.
Those clemencies came on top of the commutation awarded last month to George Santos, the disgraced former New York congressman found guilty of defrauding donors and lying to the House of Representatives. Trump cut short Santos’ seven-year sentence after less than three months.
For those who followed the standard protocol set out by the Department of Justice, the sense is growing that the process no longer matters; they’ve watched the public database of applicants swell with thousands of pending cases, while Trump grants pardons to people who never entered the system at all.
In just over nine months back in office, roughly 10,000 people have filed petitions for pardons or commutations, about two-thirds the total of the 14,867 applications submitted during the entire Biden presidency.
Under Justice Department standards and requirements, people seeking pardons generally must wait five years after their release from incarceration, demonstrate good conduct and remorse, and file petitions through the Office of the Pardon Attorney. But Trump’s actions in his second term show he has largely abandoned that process.
Those who have followed the rules are still waiting. They include small-business owners with decades-old fraud cases, veterans seeking to regain the gun rights that were stripped away with their convictions and people working jobs far below their experience because of the stigma of a criminal record.
“It’s unfair to the little guy,” said Margaret Love, who served as pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997 under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and now represents people in clemency cases. “I tell people, ‘Sorry, you don’t have a chance.’”
The pattern began in Trump’s first term, when fewer than half of his clemency recipients had applied through the Office of the Pardon Attorney. By one estimate, only 1 in 10 had been recommended by career officials in that office.
In his second term, the break from the formal process has only widened: Only 10 of the roughly 1,600 people granted pardons had filed petitions to the Office of the Pardon Attorney, and even within that small group, some did not appear to meet the Justice Department’s standards and requirements.
A huge chunk of the pardons, roughly 1,500, were people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The rest have come largely through back channels. In some of the more striking cases, Trump’s pardons erased not only criminal convictions for defendants tied to large-scale corruption and financial crimes but the restitution judges had ordered or that defendants had agreed to pay.
The Justice Department did not respond to questions about why many recent pardons appear to have come outside the traditional review process or why the president has tended to use his clemency power to help political allies and people convicted of financial crimes or public corruption.
A spokesperson for the department said in an email that the Office of the Pardon Attorney is processing clemency applications. “The Department,” the spokesperson said, “is committed to timely and carefully reviewing all applications and making recommendations to the President that are consistent, unbiased, and uphold the rule of law.”
Last month, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had served four months in prison after pleading guilty in 2023 to charges of enabling money laundering. The Wall Street Journal reported that Binance had hired a lobbyist to pursue the pardon. The company has also supported Trump’s family’s crypto ventures. In a “60 Minutes” interview, Trump said that “a lot of people asked me” to pardon Zhao and that he “didn’t know him personally.”
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that there was a “whole team of qualified lawyers who look at every single pardon request” and that Trump was the final decision-maker.
She said he was “very clear when he came into office that he was most interested in looking at pardoning individuals who were abused and used by the Biden Department of Justice and were overprosecuted by a weaponized DOJ.”
A House Judiciary Committee report written by Democratic staffers — which Republicans on the panel did not respond to — found that Trump’s second-term pardons had wiped out more than $1.3 billion in restitution and fines owed to victims and to the public. The White House called the report “pointless.”
Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission, now led by Trump appointees, dropped parallel civil cases that could have forced several defendants who were granted clemency by Trump to return hundreds of millions of dollars more, leaving victims with little recourse beyond private lawsuits.
But it’s not as if Trump broke a system that was working. A president’s pardon powers are considered absolute. For years, the clemency process has been criticized as slow, opaque and riddled with conflicts of interest — with Department of Justice attorneys helping to decide the fate of the very people they once sought to imprison. Presidents were usually faulted for using the power too sparingly to right wrongs.
Trump had a rare opportunity to fix the system. Instead, experts said, he has exploited it.
“If you’re a donor or political supporter, you move to the front of the line,” said Jim Hux, a lawyer representing a Missouri man seeking a pardon for tax crimes he committed two decades ago. He said his client has “led a model life” since finishing his sentence and fits the other criteria the Justice Department says it looks for.
“He’d love to take his grandson hunting and can’t do that because he can’t possess a firearm,” Hux said. He asked that his client not be named.
But after months of watching Trump issue clemency to people who didn’t meet the criteria — and who never went through the Office of the Pardon Attorney — Hux said that he was discouraged.
“If you’re just an average citizen, you can’t even get in the line,” Hux said. “I told my guy he’d probably be better off if he broke into the Capitol or made a major donation to Trump’s inauguration.”

In the fall of 2018, Jared Kushner convened a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. In attendance were his wife, Ivanka Trump, conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, former Obama adviser Van Jones and Kevin Sharp, a former federal judge who had resigned from the bench in protest over mandatory sentencing laws and had become an advocate for clemency reforms.
Also in the room was Kim Kardashian, the reality television star who had reinvented herself as a criminal justice advocate. She had already successfully lobbied Trump to commute the life sentence for Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother from Tennessee who had served more than two decades for cocaine trafficking and who became a national symbol of the harsh mandatory sentences imposed on nonviolent drug offenders. (During the Republican National Convention two years later, Trump would go on to grant Johnson a full pardon.)
Johnson’s release helped pave the way for the conversation. Kushner brought in legal scholars to talk about reform, inviting Mark Osler of the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota and Rachel Barkow of New York University to explain how the clemency system worked, why it failed most applicants and what it would take to fix it.
Many observers of the presidential clemency system agreed it needed fixing. Strong cases languished in bureaucratic limbo while families of applicants pleaded in vain.
Then, Trump had an opportunity to repair it. His feud with his own Justice Department during the investigation into election interference by Russia gave him space to rethink the process, to pull clemency away from the bureaucracy.
Kushner had a strong interest in mercy and second chances. His father, Charles Kushner, had been charged with tax and campaign-finance crimes. Prosecutors said he had arranged for a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law into a videotaped encounter and sent the tape to his sister before she was due to testify against him. Kushner pleaded guilty and went to prison.
Jared Kushner would later write in Time magazine that he had spent time with families of people in prison and “knew from that experience how much those people would benefit from having someone in my office who cared about this issue.”
Standing at opposite ends of a conference table, the law professors proposed an independent board to review petitions quickly and fairly, free from prosecutorial bias. It would be similar to President Gerald Ford’s post-Vietnam War clemency commission, which reviewed petitions from draft resisters and evaders, recommended pardons or alternative service for them and reported directly to the president.
According to Osler, a leading expert on clemency, the participants had questions after the presentation, but there was no obvious dissent. The participants, he said, seemed to agree that his and Barkow’s proposal was the best path forward. Barkow declined to comment.
Sharp recalled that, after the meeting, he met again with Kushner and a few others.
“Jared, in our post-meeting, seemed to agree with all of that,” Sharp said. “The question was, what would it look like? We sat back there and kind of mapped out scenarios of what one of these commissions would look like, how potential clemency applications funnel through and who would look at them before sending those recommendations to the president.”
Sharp said the commission “would have people with experience from the prosecution side of the justice system, people with experience on the defense side of the system, citizens who worked in these areas and were familiar with the issues.”
“And then,” Sharp said, “it just withered on the vine.”
Kushner did not respond to requests for comment.
Trump did advance significant criminal justice reform when he signed the First Step Act in December 2018. The bipartisan measure eased certain federal sentences by addressing disparities in drug penalties and giving judges added flexibility in sentencing nonviolent offenders.
While not a pardon, some legal experts have described the law as a structural act of clemency because it reduced mandatory sentences and allowed earlier release for thousands of prisoners.
Trump handed out pardons on his own terms, though. Many of his first-term pardons came after he had lost the 2020 election, including to campaign aides and four of the six associates who were convicted in the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Among the people granted pardons: Charles Kushner, whom Trump in his second term named U.S. ambassador to France and Monaco.

Rather than rely on the Justice Department’s traditional review system, Trump in his second term has built a parallel network of mercy led by political allies and media figures who can reach him directly.
He appointed Ed Martin, a longtime Missouri political operative and early Trump backer, as pardon attorney and the head of a new Weaponization Working Group at the Justice Department after Martin’s nomination for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia was withdrawn when Republican senators pulled their support.
Martin’s dual role was a sign that pardons had become more overt political weapons. He pledged to scrutinize Biden-era pardons and review what he described as a “weaponized” justice system. After Trump pardoned Scott Jenkins, a sheriff in Virginia and a longtime supporter convicted of taking bribes for political favors, Martin posted on X, “No MAGA left behind.”
Martin did not respond to requests for comment.
A recent NBC News report described pardons being overseen by a tight circle led by Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and White House Counsel David Warrington. Johnson, the drug offender whom Kardashian had convinced Trump to free, advises on drug cases as Trump’s “pardon czar.”
Johnson’s position is new. She has said she helps find people serving or who have served long prison sentences for nonviolent crimes and have been rehabilitated and can safely reenter their communities. She also seeks out people she believes were targeted for political reasons and submits their names to Trump.
But it’s not clear how people without connections are supposed to reach her or what standards she uses to decide which names make it to the president. Johnson has no public contact information and did not respond to messages seeking comment sent to the White House and to her personal email account and Facebook page. Warrington and Wiles, as well as the White House, also did not respond.
Some lawyers said Johnson’s influence has been minimal. One clemency attorney who represents multiple clients, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the chances of his clients receiving clemency, told ProPublica that, in Trump’s second term, he does not necessarily file cases with the Office of the Pardon Attorney.
The most effective route, he said, is a direct line to the Office of the White House Counsel.
Osler said he doesn’t know how to reach Johnson or anyone else on Trump’s pardon team. He runs a law-school clinic where students file clemency petitions for people they believe deserve a second chance but said, “We don’t know what the process is.”
“It’s not Alice’s fault, but this is not what we proposed,” he said, referring to the reform plan he and Barkow presented to Trump’s team in the president’s first term.
“Clemency is not meant to be a function that operates within a closed circle,” he said. “It’s something the Constitution establishes to give hope to the many — including those who don’t have the resources, the fame or the connections to navigate the current system.”

Liliana Trafficante is one of the thousands hoping for clemency. Like many of the people who have received pardons or commutations, she was convicted of a financial crime. But, unlike Charles Kushner, she had no family tie to the president’s inner circle. And unlike Santos, she had never been to Mar-a-Lago. She filed her petition for a pardon on her own.
Trafficante, who lives in the Bronx, pleaded guilty in 2010 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a multiyear scheme in which she collected more than $1 million in investments for a water park for foster children that she never built.
She served just over three years in federal prison and was ordered to pay $750,000 restitution to her victims. She said in an interview that she makes monthly payments but at times has been unable to keep up. She said in an interview that she feels remorse and accepts that what she did was wrong, though she maintains she was not the mastermind of the scheme.
Trafficante said that she now works as a chaplain who ministers to people in shelters and on the streets. This year, she announced on Instagram that she was running for the New York City Council. But under a 2021 city law, she could not legally take office even if voters elected her — unless Trump pardoned her. She registered a campaign committee but ultimately didn’t enter the race.
Trump’s return to office inspired her to seek a pardon. “I mean, he was going through his own criminal court case and yet he’s the president,” she said. “I was like, ‘OK, this is my guy.’”
Tony Gene Broxton, a former fire department bookkeeper from the Florida Panhandle, was indicted in 2013 on federal charges of theft of public money and making false statements. Prosecutors said he stole more than $200,000 in government benefits from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs over several years while working for his local fire district. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years of probation and a year of house arrest. He made restitution for the full amount, court records show.
As a convicted felon, Broxton lost his right to possess a gun. He applied for a pardon during the first Trump presidency, but it was finally denied by the Biden administration in 2023. After Trump returned to office, he applied again.
“I can’t go hunting with my rifles,” he said. “I can’t go target shooting with my wife. All my guns are in storage, locked up. I don’t even have access to them.”
He thought it was a good sign when, on his first day back in office, Trump pardoned the roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants. He believed that Trump would have an attorney review petitions and start approving some of them.
He checks the status of his case every day.
“But,” he said, “every time I go online it just says, still pending.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 07:56:42.453273

Without resources for enforcement, the author argues, tenant protections like rent conrol are too often moot. (Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)A 4-3 St. Paul City Council vote in September offers a cautionary tale for cities nationwide: Rights without enforcement create systems where even well-intentioned officials struggle to make protections work.
When tenants on Ashland Avenue faced 28.5% rent increases despite living with water leaks, mold, deteriorating foundations and wobbly staircases, they spent months fighting for protections the city should have provided automatically. The narrow majority (Councilmembers Cheniqua Johnson, Hwa Jeong Kim, Rebecca Noecker and Nelsie Yang) sided with tenants, limiting increases to 3%. That’s the good news. But dissenting council members Molly Coleman, Anika Bowie, and Saura Jost revealed how enforcement gaps force impossible choices for tenants and city government alike.
Cities nationwide have embraced tenant protection policies — rent control, just-cause eviction, habitability standards — but then they don’t fund enforcement. The result is “paper rights” — tenants cannot access these protections unless they have enormous resources to take on landlords, public officials and bureaucratic inertia. 
This case illustrates St. Paul’s approach to tenant issues: create elaborate protections on paper, provide minimal enforcement, then blame tenants for the resulting dysfunction.
The city’s rent stabilization ordinance caps annual increases at 3% but allows exceptions, including for landlords who can demonstrate need for “reasonable return on investment.” As it stands, tenants can appeal these increases. Since 2022, just 29 tenant appeals have made it to the City Council with roughly 7-in-10 cases denied prior to this September’s case. What happened on Ashland Avenue shows how this entire process actually works: City staff approved a 28.5% increase after reviewing financial documents, apparently without adequately assessing whether the units met basic maintenance standards, with the hearing officer suggesting the council do the same through denial of tenant appeals against such an increase.
Only when tenants organized and appealed did problems come to light.  Instead of ensuring standards were met before approving rent increases, the city required tenants to prove their units were substandard. 
In other words: Here’s your rights — good luck enforcing them on your own.
When enforcement fails, officials often choose landlords
When council members voted against limiting the rent increase, their reasoning revealed how enforcement gaps force impossible choices — and whose interests get prioritized.
Coleman and Jost deferred to systems that had already failed. Coleman argued habitability questions “should be determined through city inspections or in housing court” — even though the Department of Safety and Inspections had failed to assess conditions before approving increases. Both said: Trust the process, even when the process just failed.
Bowie opposed the tenants’ appeal to protect “naturally occurring affordable housing.” Despite acknowledging unsafe stairways and deterioration, she proposed allowing a 20% increase because landlords would be “operating at a net zero while complying with city code.” For other Ashland units: “These rents are below market rate… This isn’t a situation of a landlord trying to jack up the rent.”
This asks tenants to absorb substandard conditions and major rent increases to preserve landlord viability. Tenants living with mold and unsafe conditions are already subsidizing the landlord’s operation with their health.
The dissenting votes weren’t from incomplete information — the council had extensive documentation from a HUD-certified inspector and tenant testimony. These were value choices about whose interests matter most when enforcement fails.
The 4-3 vote shows why enforcement gaps are corrosive: They burden tenants while forcing officials into impossible choices. Without adequate enforcement, city leaders default to preserving the status quo. The result: tenants lose.
The broader lesson
Tenant protections fail without three components:
Proactive enforcement: Cities must verify compliance before approving harmful actions. Complaint-driven enforcement burdens vulnerable tenants and forces officials to decide with incomplete information. Landlords with significant property violations should no longer hide on a city council consent agenda when their license comes up for renewal or when they self-certify their rent increases, but be subject to investigation and discussion before the public who sanctions their business in the first place.
Adequate resources: St. Paul budgeted less than $500,000 for rent stabilization in 2025 to oversee thousands of units. It was insufficient this year, and as half of our city rents, it will continue to be without significantly more money. This budget gap forces officials to make judgment calls without verification infrastructure, and leaves city staff forced to cut corners when they would rather do the right thing by their neighbors.
Clear authority: The dissenting members’ uncertainty about considering habitability reflects unclear authority allowing failures to continue. Cities must define enforcement standards clearly, and do so in a way that provides clarity to decisionmakers and to those seeking remediation.
Without these, tenant protections exhaust tenants while leaving officials navigating claims without support.
The 4-3 vote went right, but three dissenting votes revealed how enforcement failures create impossible situations. In cities implementing tenant protections, the lesson is that rights without enforcement don’t just fail tenants — they create systems where even well-intentioned officials lack tools to make protections work.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P1116559-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 07:56:42.453273

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The proposed Summerlin movie studio bill now under consideration by lawmakers in a special legislative session could force the state to cut expenses or increase revenue to accommodate the bill’s massive expansion of transferable tax credits.
Assembly Bill 5, the resurrected Assembly Bill 238 from the 2025 Legislative Session earlier this year, proposes expanding Nevada’s film tax credit program from $10 million per year to $120 per year, beginning in 2029. Most of the tax credits would be associated with productions at Summerlin Studios, a proposed movie studio in Las Vegas backed by Howard Hughes Corporation, Sony Entertainment and Warner Brothers Discovery.
Legislative Counsel Bureau fiscal analyst Sarah Coffman told lawmakers Thursday that their analysis found that the sixteenfold expansion of transferable tax credits would result in the state’s ending fund balance dipping below the statutorily required 5% in 2030. That would force lawmakers to either cut tens of millions of dollars in state spending or increase revenue by that amount to maintain a balanced budget.
The analysis, discussed during a hearing of the special session’s Assembly Committee on Jobs, served as a counterpoint to film studio supporters who have for years argued that the tax credits have no fiscal downside because they are only awarded after qualified spending has occurred.
Transferable tax credits must be accounted for during the state budgeting process. One state fiscal analyst previously described it as “negative revenue.”
Revenue generated by the projects associated with the transferable film tax credits is supposed to offset the credits, but the return on investment is hotly debated across the nation.
A fiscal analysis commissioned by supporters of the Summerlin Studios bill found that for the proposed $1.65 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years, the state would receive $384.4 million back in direct revenue. That translates to Nevada receiving back 23 cents for every $1 of transferable tax credits handed out.
“So, for every dollar, we’d lose 77 cents,” said Assemblymember Greg Hafen, a Republican from Pahrump whose questions in the hearing prompted a closer look at the impact to the state budget.
If locally generated taxes are considered, the return on investment rises to 53 cents for every $1, according to Guy Hobbs, who led the analysis.
The true benefit to the state, Hobbs and others argued, comes with the indirect and induced revenue generated. With that, supporters project the return on investment to balloon to $32 per $1. That would include a required minimum $300 million spent on qualified expenses like labor, set design, catering, and other elements that involve money going from business to business.
“The economic report does not reflect the fiscal returns on those,” said Matt Walker, the Howard Hughes lobbyist who presented the bill.
AB4 is largely unchanged from its previously considered iteration. The implementation date for the availability of transferable film tax credits was moved back to 2029.
The special session bill also includes provisions that would allow the state to suspend the acceptance of transferable tax credits during economic downturns. Walker likened it to the mining industry prepaying their taxes, a maneuver the state has turned to more than once to address budget shortfalls.
Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat from Las Vegas, questioned bill presenters about AB4’s diversity and inclusion targets. The bill sets five standards, two of which must be met in order for a production to qualify for film tax credits.
Watts said that it appeared a film production could meet the requirements by having just six people into key roles.
Walker didn’t dispute Watts’ reading of the diversity requirements, but he defended the bill as “a serious commitment to thinking outside the box” and creating targets that could be reached by productions that might not be able to meet percentage requirements.
“This is not intended to water it down and create some kind of alternative minimum,” Walker added.
Supporters are describing the film bill as “a jobs bill” that will bring 19,000 construction jobs to the state, something labor unions say is desperately needed. Two labor groups are leading the charge in support of the film bill.
AB4 is also being pitched as an education bill that will provide dedicated funding for expanding pre-K seats in Clark County. The bill would create a special tax district around Summerlin Studios and funnel some of the generated revenue into a standalone fund to support the expansion of full-day early education within the Clark County School District.
Clark County Education Association, the union representing CCSD teachers, is backing the bill.
So too are the University of Nevada Las Vegas and the University of Nevada Reno, which have signed memorandums of understanding with Warner Brothers and Sony, respectively, to develop job training and other opportunities for their students.
The Assembly Committee on Jobs took no action on the bill on Thursday.
Studio bill escapes premature death
Thursday’s policy debate over the film tax credit bill almost didn’t happen after one Assembly member attempted to kill the bill early in the special session.
Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, a Democrat from Reno, requested the full Assembly vote to immediately reject AB5. Immediately rejecting a bill as it’s being introduced into the Legislature is an option listed in the procedural rules, though it is rarely, if ever, used.
The attempt to kill the film bill might have succeeded, with 21 of the 41 Assembly members physically present in the chambers voting to reject the bill. However, after La Rue Hatch moved for the vote, Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager immediately recessed the chamber. When the body reconvened, Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, who serves as the chamber’s majority leader and is the sponsor of the film bill, announced Assemblymember Teresa Brown May would be participating remotely.
Brown May, a Democrat from Las Vegas who voted for a previous iteration of the film bill when it was considered, voted against rejecting the bill, resulting in a 21-21 tie on La Rue Hatch’s attempt to kill the bill. Motions need a majority to pass, so a tie is equivalent to a failure.
Assemblymember Cecelia Gonzalez, a Las Vegas Democrat who supported rejecting the film bill, asked Yeager to explain why Brown May was authorized to vote remotely. Legislative procedural rules state that remote votes are only acceptable for “exceptional circumstances,” Gonzalez noted.
Yeager said that Brown May had “personal matters to attend to” and that it would “not be appropriate” for him to publicly disclose them.
“I have determined, in consultation with legal counsel, that remote participation is appropriate in this circumstance,” he added.
The Assembly earlier this year, during the regular legislative session, narrowly passed a version of the film bill — 22 yays, 20 nays.
Several Assembly members who voted to pass a film bill in June voted to reject it Thursday. The opposite was also true.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Nevada Resort Association on Thursday defended the provisions of Gov. Joe Lombardo’s crime bill that would allow courts to ban certain criminal offenders from the resort corridor for up to a year.
Provisions of Assembly Bill 4 mirror the functions of the now-dissolved Resort Corridor Court, which was created to deal with low-level crimes on the Strip, often by barring offenders from entering the tourist district for months at a time.
The short-lived specialty court, established by the Clark County Justice Court in 2023, was disbanded the next year after questions about its legality arose. 
Matt Griffin, a lobbyist for the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers on the special session’s Assembly Committee on Public Safety and Security that those questions were resolved in April after a Clark County District Court Judge affirmed the county had the authority to enact criminal ordinances on the resort corridor. The court ruled it was not a violation of the First Amendment to bar individuals from the corridor once they were charged or convicted of a crime in the corridor.
Critics of the court argued ordinances on the resort corridor violated free speech laws by targeting street performers and vendors with low-level offences. 
While the bill includes language giving the Justice Court the authority to re-establish a Resort Corridor Court, the bill itself does not revive the controversial court, said Griffin.
“I think there’s been some misunderstanding about what’s being proposed today,” Griffin told lawmakers. “We are not seeking for this body to enact a corridor court. That is a decision for the Justice Court to make and the Justice Court to make alone.”
The bill proposes establishing order-out corridors for individuals convicted of crimes within these areas, with discretionary penalties for first offenses and mandatory one-year bans for subsequent offenses made within two years. 
Virginia Valentine, the president and CEO of the Nevada Resort Association, told lawmakers repeat offenders were undeterred by current penalties.
“Recidivism continues to be a significant issue in our tourism areas,” Valentine said.
Provisions pushed by the Nevada Resort Association would also elevate certain crimes against hospitality workers to higher felony categories by categorizing them as a protected class, similar to utility workers and school teachers.
The Nevada Resort Association also proposed an amendment to the bill that would require the court to submit an annual report that includes the number of people barred from the corridor, their crime, and the rate of successful completion of their sentence. No public data was available on the previous court’s operation.
Several gaming companies spoke in support of the crime bill, including Red Rock Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, Boyd Gaming Corporation, MGM Resorts International, and Wynn Resorts. 
Provision surrounding the resort corridor attracted a slew of testimony in opposition. Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, argued the bill would privatize part of the judicial system. While it does not directly reestablish a corridor court, Haseebullah said it opens the door to build one again.
“This is an optical, performative bill that basically sells out the interests of our community for what the resorts want. When the corridor court was created it targeted people, largely who are unhoused and street performers. It targeted very few, if any, folks who engaged in violence, because it was a Justice Court initiative, if there were violent offenses that would have been bound over to District Court,” Haseebullah said.
“It’s a banishment court so they could continue to try to privatize Las Vegas Boulevard, despite the fact that locals are the ones who pay the bill for that,” he said.
The gaming industry’s asks are just one component of AB4, a sweeping bill that covers several areas of criminal law. The bill would also: 

expand the definition of stalking to include dating relationships and cyberstalking via social media; 
add kidnapping and attempted domestic violence to the list of felony domestic violence offenses;
mandate firearm surrender compliance within 2-5 business days post-conviction;
increase penalties for DUI-related offenses and establish an alternative correctional program;
Child pornography possession would be charged per image; 
eliminate automatic sealing of records for offenses against children or the elderly;
prioritize restitution to victims; and 
addresses violence against school employees.

It’s mid-November in Montana, but the temperatures across the nation’s fourth largest state are all in the high 60s.  There’s two weeks left in hunting season, but there’s no tracking snow except at the highest elevations.  And it’s been dry for a long time as summer’s drought continues unabated.  As for the ski areas, even those with the ability to make snow can’t do so if it doesn’t fall well below freezing at night. 
Put it all together and it’s pretty clear the Big Sky State has hit the wall on how much water it can continue to give away, especially for wells being drilled for new developments that are exempt from the standard water appropriation process. 
How bad is it?  
Well, it’s a very, very, very rare case when you see environmental and conservation organizations such as the Montana Environmental Information Center, the Clark Fork Coalition, and Trout Unlimited on the same side of a water rights lawsuit as the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, the Montana League of Cities and Towns and the Association of Gallatin Agricultural Irrigators.  
But that’s what just happened this week when they were all co-Plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed against the State of Montana and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. 
So why would such strange bedfellows all have the same complaint with the exempt wells law?  It’s because the state continues to allow more exempt wells for new, rural subdivisions to draw groundwater, including in basins that are closed to further appropriation permits — and the drawdown is affecting existing water rights and use in every one of those sectors. 
The simplest example is a milkshake.  If you only have one straw in a milkshake it will last a lot longer than if you have many straws which very quickly results in everyone sucking air because the milkshake is gone.  Like a milkshake, Montana’s water resources are a finite quantity and cannot “meet the demand” for ever more withdrawals.  
Moreover, wells don’t just suck water straight up the straw — they create a “cone of depression” that draws in water from an area far larger than the well location.  That cone then affects other water users as experienced in August when the City of Boulder decided to sell water to the Crazy Mountain Ranch to water its golf course, drying up springs and existing water sources.  When an existing water rights holder filed a complaint with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, the city was told to halt its withdrawals, that the agency considered the well illegal, and then fined the Crazy Mountain Ranch $8,000 — the maximum allowed by law — for violating the Montana Water Use Act.  The issue is now in court as the ranch disputes the fine.
Nor are private water uses the only problem with the exempt well law.  When wells drawdown groundwater or aquifers it impacts the complex hydrogeological systems that affect the water table for rivers and streams, wetlands, lakes, and other public resources the state holds in trust for its citizens.
It’s likely the exempt well law will go down due to the “unintended consequences” of allowing more water withdrawal than there is water especially with our warmer, drier climate.  
If the question is whether the state should give priority to existing residents’ needs instead of allowing new wells for people who don’t even live here yet the simple answer is “yes” — existing residents should absolutely have priority in the allocation of our finite but critical water resources before we all go dry.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P1090687-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 06:58:00.148091

RUTLAND — At first glance, the plan for a new Rutland Free Library looked promising: Replace its pre-Civil War-era brick building with nearby downtown space in hopes of cutting construction costs in half and corralling a host of other local government services into a “civic center.”
If only an architect hadn’t crunched the numbers and calculated a $18 million price tag that’s four times higher than originally estimated.
“That’s not a savings,” library director Randal Smathers said this month. “That’s about what it would cost to redo the building.”

Rutland — Vermont’s most populous municipality outside of Chittenden County — recently green-lit a new tax increment financing district to support a seven-story hotel and apartment block and other downtown improvements. But after 15 years of attempted upgrades, its public library has hit another roadblock on the path toward renovating or replacing its aging facility.
“Back to the drawing board,” Smathers said.
The 76,000-book library has a long history of struggling with space. Since its founding in 1886, the institution has moved from various downtown storefronts, the since-demolished Memorial Hall and the old Longfellow School to its current site — an 1858 Renaissance Revival structure at the corner of Court and Center streets that, up until 1935, housed the city’s post office, courthouse and jail.
“In location and style, this influential building reflects the changes occurring in the city as a result of its initial railroad boom,” the national Society of Architectural Historians has noted. “The site was a compromise, partway down the hill between the original village center on Main Street and the new commercial focus developing in the vicinity of the railroad depot.” 
Residents approved two additions in the 1960s and 1980s, only to see the original building’s ceilings sag and foundation crumble. The library unveiled plans to move to space at nearby Center and Wales streets in 2009 and the former College of St. Joseph campus on the city’s outskirts in 2020, only to be tripped up by costs and criticism.
“Top architects told us the public will compare whatever design we put forward to an idealized library they remember when they were children, and that’s absolutely true,” Smathers told VTDigger last winter during the latest round of meetings. “People start their input with, ‘When I was a kid …’ They form emotional attachments. They love this building. It’s beautiful — and also terrible for a modern library.”
Staying put isn’t any cheaper. The library had banked $1.5 million for capital repairs a year ago when it learned estimates to renovate the current building had risen to nearly 10 times that much. Rutland Mayor Mike Doenges then suggested the library join City Hall in studying the possibility of relocating together in the downtown’s three-decade-old Asa Bloomer state office building on Merchants Row.
‘Libraries have unique challenges’
Leaders hoped the proposed “civic center” — similar to South Burlington’s shared library and city office building that opened in 2021 — would join a list of more than 30 other Vermont library building projects approved since 2010.

But while Rutland residents have acknowledged the library’s problems, they weren’t sold on the proposed solution. At public hearings earlier this year, they voiced reservations about finding parking and feeling safe downtown.
Moving on to develop blueprints and a budget, the library learned its initial civic center project estimate of $4.5 million would actually be closer to $18 million.
“Libraries have unique challenges, the first one being that books are really, really heavy,” Smathers said this past week of a list of complications shared by an architect. “We started looking at the work to upgrade to the standards we would need and the savings went away.”
Back at square one, the library recently received two major private donations, raising its building fund to $4.3 million.
“The library is ready, willing and able to invest that somewhere in downtown Rutland,” Smathers said.
But the exact location remains up in the air. Smathers noted the local Walmart is projected to leave its 76,000-square-foot Rutland Plaza anchor space in 2027 for a new “supercenter” at the former Diamond Run Mall property in neighboring Rutland Town.
“If Walmart does move out, Rutland is going to need reasons for people to go downtown, and a beautiful new library that pays for a third of its own cost upfront seems to me to be the kind of investment that makes a lot of sense,” Smathers said. “If that possibility or another plot of land is available, we need to take a serious look at it.”
In a statement, the Brixmor Property Group, the Rutland Plaza’s operator, said it was “working on strategies to backfill the space” with the expectation Walmart would remain for two more years.
“Our goal is to bring in retailers that are relevant to the communities we serve and we’re happy to work with the city to achieve that,” Brixmor spokesperson Maria Pace said.
Whatever the future holds, Smathers said it can’t be the status quo.
“The problems in this building are not going away,” he said. “At some point, likely in the next five years, something is going to break and we’re not going to be able to open for the public. If somebody is looking for a tax write-off and wants to donate a 25,000-square-foot building, I’m the guy to call.”

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel met with migrant advocates in Grand Rapids at a Thursday roundtable to discuss the impacts of federal policy under the Trump administration on their ability to do their work, especially around concerns of immigration detention and deportation. 
Migrant Legal Aid, which hosted the roundtable, as well as Puertas Abiertas, a Grand Rapids-based organization focused on helping Latinx victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, described situations where federal enforcement had in the past been helpful or necessary to help victims of trafficking or exploitation, but now came with a high risk of detention or deportation for those very victims. 
“When we’re talking about the people who are being exploited, who’s exploited more, of course, than the undocumented?” Nessel said. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For example, explained Teresa Hendricks, the Executive Director of Migrant Legal Aid, when they are working to investigate farms for potential labor trafficking violations, they would normally turn to the Department of Labor for help with assessing those violations. 
“In fact, it’s been the opposite, to the point where, in Michigan, if a grower is being investigated by us, they will call DOL to get an inspection, which is basically a whitewash, to say, look, they can’t find anything,” Hendricks said. 
That’s also a question of an ability to engender trust in workers regardless of immigration status, Hendricks said, which called the organization’s “secret little superpower.”
Meanwhile, Alejandra Garces Pozo, a farmworker outreach specialist with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained that she has had many people reach out to her to cancel their benefits, including Medicaid or food assistance, because of fears that the Department of Homeland Security could be accessing their data.  
“We’re seeing the struggles and the changes in our programs, in our departments, like with helping people apply for state benefits, like whether it’s Medicaid or food assistance or childcare or state emergency relief,” Pozo said. “I’ve had a lot of clients call me so stressed to the point where by the time I’m like, ‘What is it that you want me to do?’ She’s like, ‘I want you to take my benefits away. I don’t want benefits anymore’.”

Those data sharing concerns have been the target of a number of suits joined by Nessel’s office, as she noted in the roundtable, including injunctions on data sharing with Homeland Security regarding SNAP food assistance benefits and Medicaid. 
“I know why people are scared and don’t feel safe and don’t want to participate in programs that they are eligible under law to participate in need and need and badly need,” Nessel responded. 
She added that her own concerns about data privacy under the Trump administration, especially tax return data from the IRS, led her to actually stop hosting trainings with senior citizens on protecting their personal information. 










They’re just terrified. They don’t want to call 911. They don’t trust them.


– Elizabeth Centeno, a bilingual youth group facilitator with Puertas Abiertas


“How am I now trying to tell people how to protect their Social Security number when I don’t even know who has their Social Security number?” she said. 
That lack of ability to work with federal agencies has also impacted Nessel’s own work, she explained. Her office will work on a case involving something as serious as sex trafficking, but when the FBI or Homeland Security get involved, they often instead detain and try to deport the victims.  
“It’s very, very difficult to be a state attorney general, working with the locals, working with the county, working with MSP (Michigan State Police). We just have a really difficult time doing this work when we don’t have the federal agencies involved,” Nessel said, adding that some powers, like granting visas to victims, are outside of her power. “The trust is not there that they’ll treat people who are victims like victims instead of like criminals.”

“Our clients are in so much fear of even calling law enforcement just because of the situation that is going on with Homeland Security,” added Elizabeth Centeno, a bilingual youth group facilitator with Puertas Abiertas. “They’re just terrified. They don’t want to call 911. They don’t trust them.”
Claudia Annoni, the executive director of Puertas Abiertas, also noted that threats of immigration enforcement are often weaponized against victims of domestic violence or trafficking. 
“It adds also to the level of intimidation, because if the perpetrator is a legal citizen here in the United States and you’re not, that is an easy one,” she said. “You say something, and I’ll call immigration on you.”
Nessel responded to Centeno to note that that hesitancy makes it harder to identify victims or witnesses to crimes. She also added that masked and unmarked law enforcement vehicles or uniforms make it hard for people to tell if they’re being stopped by actual police or immigration agents, as opposed to people posing as them.
“It’s really damaging for all of law enforcement,” she said. “It’s creating that confusion in the communities.”
Another concern raised at the roundtable was the availability of grant funding, and how challenging new rules regarding diverse or inclusive language have created new challenges for groups like Puertas Abiertas to even function.  
“The reality is … we serve this community. And when you’re applying for a grant or you’re applying to a foundation, you aren’t gonna lie, ‘Well, we serve people.’ We serve the Latinx community,” Annoni said. “Who do we trust that we can send a letter, a proposal to receive funding.”
Molly Spaak, deputy director and attorney at Migrant Legal Aid, said that their organization had gone through a thesaurus to find different language to use when their $300,000 federal grant was cut — over half of their annual budget. 
The burden on groups like Migrant Legal Aid has increased exponentially — Hendricks noted that they get calls nearly every day asking for help with questions about emergency estate planning, managing mortgages and custody of children when someone is being deported imminently. That falls outside of their normal scope of work, and means that they often have to direct people to outside, private lawyers — who are often very expensive. 
“I think a key takeaway is that all of this happens so quickly and it’s so confusing, and our clients are usually terrified by this whole experience,” Spaak said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A business lobbyist Thursday sought to salvage a new unemployment insurance bill that has sparked opposition from some Democrats and advocates for people with disabilities.
The bill came from the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. The council is historically a source of consensus legislation to update Wisconsin’s laws on jobless pay, but its 2025 proposal includes provisions Democrats have strongly opposed.
The senior Democrat on the Assembly’s labor committee has disavowed the bill because it includes a financial penalty for people who receive federal disability pay if they apply for unemployment insurance when they’re laid off from a job.
The council bill also contains several other changes that Democratic lawmakers have unanimously opposed and Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed in the past.

At a public hearing Thursday on the legislation, AB 652, Scott Manley of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce emphasized that the measure had the unanimous support of both the management and labor members of the advisory council.
Manley chairs the council’s management caucus. Representatives from the council’s labor caucus did not take part in the hearing.
“There’s a reason we have a council,” Manley told the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment. “It’s a process we believe in. We think it’s a process that works. And we would ask everybody in the community to respect that process.”
WMC and other business groups have repeatedly backed Republican legislators’ bills to change the state’s unemployment laws when they bypassed the joint advisory council.  Evers has regularly vetoed such bills.
Manley said that it would be unprecedented for an advisory council bill to split the Legislature on party lines, however.
“My fear is that if the Legislature decides to turn this into a partisan issue, despite the fact that it was unanimously supported by labor and management, that Gov. Evers would consider vetoing the bill,” Manley said.
If that happens, he said, the bill’s $25 bump in the state’s maximum weekly jobless pay — the first increase in more than a decade — would likely be put off until 2027.
Victor Forberger, a lawyer who specializes in unemployment law, said even that increase, bringing the maximum benefit to $395 a week, was inadequate compared with surrounding states.
Minnesota tops out at $914 a week, Forberger testified. Iowa’s maximum is $602 and Michigan’s is $446, with an increase to $530 in 2026.
“We’re not keeping pace with the states around us,” Forberger told the committee. “We’re not even coming close to that
The disability-jobless pay conflict
The advisory council bill’s highest-profile point of contention applies to people who receive Social Security Disability Income.
Since 2013, Wisconsin law has automatically disqualified SSDI recipients from collecting jobless pay, even if they get laid off from a job and otherwise meet the requirements for unemployment compensation.
A federal judge ruled in 2024 that the SSDI jobless pay ban violated federal law. After an additional court order this summer, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development is now reviewing the cases of people denied unemployment compensation in the last 10 years due to the SSDI ban, and is issuing payments to those who qualify.
The joint advisory council unemployment bill repeals the ban on unemployment insurance for SSDI recipients. But it would also cut their jobless pay by 50% of their SSDI pay.
That provision led Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), the ranking Democrat on the labor committee, to keep her name off the list of sponsors for the advisory council bill.
“I simply cannot support taking benefits from those who are disabled,” Sinicki said when she, along with the committee’s other two Democrats, voted against the bill’s formal introduction Thursday. “They receive very little money to begin with. And now to reduce their benefits to me is unconscionable.”
Manley defended the 2013 law that excluded SSDI recipients from the unemployment insurance program.
“SSDI is intended to compensate somebody for their loss of earning capacity based on a disability,” he said. “And unemployment is supposed to compensate somebody through the loss of their earnings because they were laid off or their job was eliminated or some other reason that’s no fault of their own. So, that’s why the policy decision was made in the first place that we wouldn’t allow people to have both benefits.”
While the court ruled against a blanket exclusion from unemployment compensation for people getting SSDI, Manley argued that offsetting their jobless pay by a portion of their disability income is comparable to existing provisions that offset unemployment benefits based on other wage income.

But SSDI is not like a wage, said Forberger, whose lawsuit overturned Wisconsin’s SSDI jobless pay ban.
“SSDI is essentially getting your Social Security benefits early,” Forberger testified. While Social Security payments are based on lifetime earnings at retirement age, he said, unemployment is based on a recent job loss, and unemployment benefits are based on earnings in the last year and a half.
The average SSDI benefit in Wisconsin as of December 2023 was about $1,400 per month, he said. SSDI recipients take part-time jobs because their disability income “is not enough to support themselves,” Forberger said. “They need additional money to make ends meet.”
The federal Social Security Administration, which administers the disability program, encourages recipients to work so they might make a transition back to the workforce and no longer need benefits. “Essentially, what Wisconsin is saying to disabled folks here is . . . ‘We don’t want you working anymore,’” Forberger said.
Other provisions
Several other items in the advisory council bill previously were part of Republican bills that Evers vetoed in the past when they reached his desk.
One would require DWD to establish a website where employers could report unemployment compensation recipients who “ghosted” job interviews or didn’t show up for the first day on the job after an offer.
Another would require audits of 50% of all work searches by people collecting jobless pay. In 41% of work search audits that DWD conducted, “claimants failed to fulfill weekly work search requirements,” said Brian Dake of Wisconsin Independent Businesses. “We believe this data justifies the need for more audits.”
 A third provision stipulates specific checks that DWD should make to ensure that a person who makes an unemployment claim isn’t stealing another person’s identity or engaged in some other fraudulent activity.
The bill also would mandate electronic filing of payroll information for business owners with fewer than 25 employees.
Forberger, in his testimony, rejected all those provisions as ineffectual or unnecessary.
“Ghosting interviews is already illegal in this state,” he said, with stiffer penalties than outlined in the bill. Employers, he added, are unlikely to go to the trouble of filing a report and take the time for the hearings that would follow.
Forberger observed that the department already consults a wide range of databases in checking out claims. And he said small employers have sought his help after making mistakes and getting in trouble with the department in filing required payroll documentation.
“To mandate online-only filing is just going to make it that much harder for these employers,” Forberger said.
(According to DWD communications director Haley McCoy, in 2024 about 97% of taxable employers with fewer than 25 employees submitted their wage reports electronically. “Fewer and fewer employers file on paper every quarter with current figures showing less than 3% filing by paper,” McCoy told the Wisconsin Examiner.)
Forberger said the bill’s work search audit requirement was redundant, because DWD already conducts work search audits of every person filing a claim. He said he’s heard from many people who don’t understand what constitutes a work search and how to report it.
“When they’re getting audited, they’re getting disqualified,” Forberger said. “If you really want to improve the system, DWD needs to start doing some training and helping people how to navigate the system.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana leaders gathered Thursday to consider how the state could mine its ample coal waste for the rare earth elements key to modern technology — in a bid to boost domestic production and break China’s dominance.
“I want all these liabilities that we’ve got to turn into resources,” Kit Turpin, director of the state’s Abandoned Mine Land Program, told the Indiana Rare Earth Recovery Council at its first meeting.
Gov. Mike Braun created the group in an April executive order. He directed its 13 members to help develop a coal waste-based rare earths industry.
The 17 metallic elements are critical to defense, health care, power generation, transportation and other industries. They’re also in widely used consumer products, like iPhones and LED lights.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Despite their name, the elements aren’t actually rare — they’re just typically “finely dispersed,” rarely found concentrated enough to easily extract.
Major deposits are found in China — the world’s leading rare earths producer — as well as Brazil, Russia, and elsewhere, said Maria Mastalerz, a research geologist for the Indiana Geological and Water Survey.
Federal estimates place the U.S. at just 1 million metric tons of reserves, compared to global reserves of about 120 million metric tons.
“Indiana does not have traditional sources” of rare earths, Mastalerz said.
But coal and its production byproducts — gob, slurry, spent substrate, acid drainage and sludge, and more — could be “unconventional” sources.
Tapping coal
“Every point” of mining, processing and using coal presents “special” opportunities to recover rare earths, according to Mastalerz.
However, these materials are “low-grade,” with lower concentrations of rare earths, she repeatedly cautioned.
That makes extraction more difficult and expensive.
Mastalerz — who specializes in coal geology, organic petrology and geochemistry — is testing ways to find rare earth “sweet spots” and “optimize” their recovery.
The materials are plentiful, though.

Turpin, whose Department of Natural Resources program rehabilitates abandoned mine lands, said Indiana has more than 1,900 sites. The program has almost $80 million worth of projects in the pipeline, but there’s an estimated $400 million worth of unfunded inventory, he said.
“The economics don’t look good” for rare earths recovery, he said, “but if you already have a problem (in abandoned mine lands) that needs addressed, maybe you can find efficiencies.”
The program tested a gob pile and found dozens of elements, including rare earths and other critical minerals, per Turpin.
“Every cubic yard of coal refuse out there contains about 10 grams of yttrium — what’s in your hand there,” Turpin said, as council members passed around a small case with chunks of lustrous metal.
“The problem with it is … you’re talking about processing a ton of this material for that 10 grams,” he told them.

The gob pile has an estimated $10 billion worth of rubidium in it, he added, but it’s stuck in 2 million yards of material.
The program must use its largely federal funding on mine land reclamation, however. Rare earths recovery has to be “incidental” — another challenge.
‘Your test state’
Federal officials called in from Washington, D.C., to praise Indiana.
“The things that you’re doing are the same things that we would like to do,” said Lanny Erdos, director of the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.
“We really are with you in your efforts here,” said Ned Mamula, director of the U.S. Geological Survey. “… We want to change our thinking about this. Pile of waste? No. … There’s products in there. We’ve got to find a way to get them out.”
Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski thanked the pair, telling them, “Keep in mind, we’d like to be your test state — a beta — and definitely your partner here. So we’ll keep you updated on our activities.”

Braun’s order includes several directives for the council: advance a coal site cleanup program, collaborate with industry on extraction and processing technology, establish Indiana-based supply and refinery operations, and work with educational institutions to create an extraction and processing workforce program.
The group has to provide annual updates to the governor, and a final report is due before the end of 2026.
The next meeting date hasn’t yet been set. Council members suggested bringing in industry representatives, like those interested in processing rare earths out of coal waste or those who’d use the elements in their products.

Others recommended calling on more academics, since the technology might not be advanced enough for industry, and to consider recovering the elements from recycled technology.
Indiana has an estimated 57 billion tons of unmined coal but only 17 billion tons are recoverable using current technology, said Tommy Sutton, vice president of surface operations at Hallador Energy’s Sunrise Coal.
Of that recoverable amount, 88% would require underground mining and just 12% could be extracted via surface mining.
“I think we’ve got several years,” Sutton said of the industry, but companies are “competing for the same coal reserves.” He said coal companies are turning to byproducts like methane, sulphur and possibly rare earths.
“What was refuse at one point is now something you can actually use,” he told the council.

Parcel 0712 is part of a complex of oil and gas leases in ecologically valuable sagebrush-steppe that the Bureau of Land Management has proposed for auction in June. 
The post Drilling lease slated 2 miles from world’s largest sage grouse lek, center punching planet’s longest mule deer migration appeared first on WyoFile .","The rolling, rockpile-strewn sagebrush that unfurls along more than 3 square miles of the Golden Triangle region appeared mostly devoid of life during a recent mid-November afternoon walk.
But brown, chalky spheres and cylinders of scat littering the landscape offered evidence of winged and hooved animals that call this ground home seasonally and throughout the year. 
A mile or so southwest of the Lander Cutoff Road, this 2,194-acre Bureau of Land Management parcel is proposed for inclusion in an oil and gas lease sale set for June. 
Wildlife biologists know the tract, labeled Parcel 0712 in the lease sale, as among the most biologically rich reaches of the sagebrush-steppe biome remaining anywhere on Earth. 
Evidence of the claim is illustrated by the area’s abundance of greater sage grouse.

Just two miles from the boundary of Parcel 0712 is the sprawling Divide Lek, which retired Wyoming sage grouse coordinator Tom Christiansen frequents in the spring. He’s there to count male birds strutting to court mates, and there are a ton of them. 
“It’s the largest lek on the planet, at least that I’m aware of,” Christiansen said. “The highest [count] was over 300. I don’t remember the exact number, but this last year [the count] was over 200.” 
Parcel 0712’s proximity to the largest-known congregation of sage grouse, a struggling species, isn’t the only superlative descriptor of its wildlife value. This parcel amid the sagebrush sea also completely overlaps the main thread of the longest mule deer migration corridor known to Wyoming and the world. 
Discovered by biologist Hall Sawyer relatively recently in 2011, the route is used by thousands of mule deer headed to summer in the Hoback Basin, with the record setters even venturing as far as eastern Idaho. Come winter, the animals are found in the Red Desert and lower reaches of the Green River Basin. To get to and from their seasonal ranges, these ungulates travel a 100-plus miles, passing through the Prospect Mountains along the foot of the Wind River Range and right through the middle of Parcel 0712.

Discussion is brewing in conservation circles about BLM’s proposed leasing of not just Parcel 0712, but tens of thousands of acres spread across five dozen parcels that intersect with Wyoming’s first three protected mule deer migration corridors. The lease auction set for June also could include tracts overlapping Wyoming’s first protected pronghorn corridor — a route that’s passed muster with state wildlife officials, but awaits a group of stakeholders and Gov. Mark Gordon’s approval. 
All of the oil and gas leases slated for a June 2026 auction are in the early stages of the BLM’s vetting and approval process. Currently, they’re being “scoped,” subjected to public scrutiny and could still be pulled and never offered. Comments on the proposed parcels can be submitted online and are due by Monday. If they do get leased, an entirely separate environmental review process would await before approval is granted to actually drill. 
Still, wildlife advocacy groups are questioning the wisdom of leasing the most vital sage grouse habitat remaining and areas in the middle of big game migration routes. 
“Are we really okay with potentially sacrificing some of our most important wildlife habitat?” asked Alec Underwood, conservation director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council. “What kind of message does that send to all those who value wildlife and future generations?”

But oil and gas companies that have fueled Wyoming’s economy and enabled the state to save and invest an extraordinary amount of money have a starkly different interpretation. 
“There’s no place that I’m going to say is a place that shouldn’t be leased,” said Steve Degenfelder, a land manager for Kirkwood Oil and Gas, which is the primary company expressing interest in drilling the Golden Triangle region. 
Degenfelder anticipates leases in the Golden Triangle will come with “extensive surface occupancy stipulations.” Those restrictions combined with modern drilling technology, he said, can help ensure that nesting sage grouse, migrating mule deer and other wildlife aren’t extensively harmed. 
“I’m confident that the BLM land managers and Game and Fish can work with the operator, whoever that is, to mitigate [wildlife impacts],” Degenfelder said.
Another well-known Wyomingite whose ranch is right across the Lander Cutoff from Parcel 0712 said he’d need to learn more before passing judgement on the prospects of leasing and drilling an area that others consider ecologically sacred. 
“Would I be supportive of anything they decided to do? Certainly not,” said Jim Magagna, a longtime livestock lobbyist. “But on the other hand, I’m very open minded about getting a better understanding of the development potential. What would it look like?” 

An oil and gas lease has been proposed for Parcel 0712, located within an area designated as off limits to leasing by the Bureau of Land Management’s Rock Springs Field Office. The parcel is within 2 miles of the world’s largest known sage grouse lek. (Bureau of Land Management)
Without digging into his files, Degenfelder wasn’t sure if Kirkwood specifically nominated Parcel 0712. But the Casper-based company has long shown an interest in Golden Triangle-area parcels and it’s one of the outfits that has been leasing ground there for years over the objections of conservation groups. The nearly 20,000 Golden Triangle acres slated for auction in June were nominated in 2021, Degenfelder said. The parcels were initially going to be offered in June 2022, but then a consortium of environmental groups led by The Wilderness Society sued and were successful.  
BLM’s proposal to lease the area again in 2025 is especially controversial because the standing federal land-use plan — the Biden-era Rock Springs Resource Management Plan — explicitly doesn’t allow it. Officials with the federal agency’s Wyoming office, who’ve been furloughed for weeks during the government shutdown, have been unreachable to explain the discrepancy, though notably, they’ve started the process of revising the current plan. 
Degenfelder, meanwhile, points to President Donald Trump’s “national energy emergency” declaration as an explanation for BLM proposing to lease an area designated as off limits.
“It was similar to a War Powers Act,” he said of the declaration. “That could very well be the reason why.”
Others remain skeptical of leasing in the Golden Triangle. Christiansen, the former Game and Fish sage grouse corridor, said he’ll be watching to see how his old employer, the state of Wyoming, responds to BLM’s proposal. 
“If the state chooses to support the lease sale, it puts public trust in state policies like the [sage grouse] executive order at risk, because they’re supporting an illegal action,” Christiansen said. “If we support actively disregarding the rule of law at the state level, the public can’t support or can’t trust state policy, either.” 
During the 2019 debate over oil and gas leasing in the Golden Triangle, state wildlife officials did not advocate for “no surface occupancy” stipulations, pointing toward the state’s grouse policy, which they deemed adequate. Likewise, Wyoming’s ungulate migration policy also doesn’t call for no-disturbance stipulations outside of “bottlenecks” — and there are none in that portion of the designated Sublette Mule Deer Migration and proposed Sublette Pronghorn Migration.

Although sage grouse were nowhere to be seen during WyoFile’s recent visit to Parcel 0712, that’s likely because the chicken-sized birds have reached the time of year when they are less dispersed, and instead concentrated in flocks that can number in the hundreds. 
“They’re gathering now in their winter flocks,” Christiansen said. “It’s harder to find a group, but when you find a group, it’s going to be a lot larger.”
They’ll stay in the area of Parcel 0712, the adjacent record-setting Divide Lek and in the surrounding reaches of the best sagebrush habitat left on Earth, which are all part of a “broad winter complex,” the biologist said. Then come next spring — a month or two before the BLM’s planned lease sale — they’ll start strutting.

As a powerful solar storm painted brilliant hues across Wyoming skies, people went searching for the perfect backdrop to catch the epic light show. Even backyards, streets and alleyways offered stunning views of the northern lights.

Even backyards, streets and alleyways offered stunning views of the northern lights, giving people a show from wherever they were standing. 
Astronomer and Wyoming Stargazing Executive Director Samuel Singer told WyoFile that the geomagnetic storm was forecast to be most active Wednesday evening, but nearly 100% cloud cover obscured the aurora. In contrast, Tuesday evening’s cloudless skies “surprisingly” rolled out the brilliant hues. The storm’s geomagnetic activity reached a planetary K-index (kp) of 8, with the scale running from 1 (calm) to 9 (most extreme), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

Singer noted that while auroras peak around midnight, “when most people are in bed,” this celestial event peaked between 6 to 7 p.m. The early show, with more vivid colors than expected, prompted a rapid exchange of texts and phone calls, he said. 
“There were a ton of people just getting home from work and having dinner,” Singer said. “They looked outside and said, ‘Oh my God, look at that color.’”
Dubois resident Christina Botkin and her family watched the aurora from the comfort of their home. 
“Our neighborhood is at about 8,000 feet, and there’s hardly any light pollution, so we had an amazing view,” Botkin said. “It was the first time our kids had seen the northern lights, and they’ve been talking about it ever since.”
Wilson resident Kim Havel described her neighbors’ almost primal response to the cosmic scene, with people “howling like wolves around the neighborhood.” Kyle Haynam, a longtime Moose resident, said the park had almost as many headlights as northern lights. 
“I felt transported to Burning Man for a moment,” Haynam said. “There was a couple parked in our driveway, having what looked like a nice date with a bottle of wine as they enjoyed the show.”

Wilson resident Annabelle Reber headed out to Antelope Flats in Grand Teton National Park to get the ideal shot. She used the slow shutter feature on her cellphone to capture the colorful show over the Tetons. Awestruck aurora watchers crowded the pullouts along the highway, creating roadway conditions similar to bear jams. Reber even had to swerve around a man who suddenly ran across the road in front of her car, she told WyoFile. 
Jackson resident Ike Faust and his family joined the convoy of cars headed north, eventually finding a more remote location near Jackson Hole Golf and Tennis Club.
“In Wyoming, it was the biggest northern lights show that I’ve ever seen,” Faust said. “Even in Alaska, I have never seen that red.”
On the eastern edge of Teton Park in the tiny town of Kelly, Wendell Field described the experience as his first time standing under a red aurora borealis.

“Usually, there’s more green,” Field said. “Sometimes the colors dance like a curtain or like seaweed in the ocean, but the reds had more of a pulsating effect.”  
Singer explained how cosmic rays of red and green become visible to the naked eye. He said that when big explosions occur in the outer atmosphere of the sun, solar particles collide with Earth’s atmosphere. When the solar particles funnel toward the highest concentration of magnetism at the southern and northern poles, bands of colors sweep across the skies. 
Red auroras, according to NASA, are created when stronger solar storms push the interaction between oxygen atoms and solar particles to higher altitudes, typically above 150 miles. Green, which is more commonly seen, results from the geomagnetic exchange occurring at lower altitudes, approximately 62 to 186 miles. Other colors, including pink, blue, purple, orange and yellow can also streak the sky when various molecules react at different elevations.
Over the past couple of days, photos of the colors dancing above Wyoming have flooded social media channels. Jackson Hole filmmaker and writer Charlie Craighead said the lights were bright enough to illuminate the foreground, creating optimal photography conditions.   
“The auroras I’ve seen in the Arctic were really intense and focused, but here the colors seem to wash over the sky in big swaths that light up the whole landscape,” Craighead said. 
While photographs of the aurora can be breathtaking, Singer said nothing compares to being there during one of the “most miraculous wonders of nature.” 
“The difference between seeing a photograph of the northern lights and standing under the phenomenon is like the difference between seeing a photograph of the ocean and actually standing barefoot on a beach with the water hitting your ankles as you dig your toes into the sand,” Singer said.
With Tuesday’s cloudless skies, the northern lights could be seen over the Center for the Arts in downtown Jackson. (Karissa Akin)

Critics call it a crisis.,"Michelle Stroud, a family child care provider in Toms River, talks about a $30 million budget shortfall in the state child care assistance program during a news conference on Nov. 13, 2025, at the Statehouse in Trenton. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Advocates are urging New Jersey lawmakers to cover a $30 million budget gap in a state-funded child care program for low-income working parents, saying the shortfall has had “devastating consequences” for families and providers alike.
The state’s child care assistance program quit accepting new applicants on Aug. 1 and raised copays for already-enrolled families after lawmakers in June passed a $58.8 billion budget that did not include enough money to cover the program’s total operating costs.
Those program changes forced some parents to quit their jobs or reduce their work hours because they couldn’t get assistance or afford the higher copays, and that, in turn, drove some providers to cut their hours or consider closing as their enrollment fell, according to a coalition of about 30 social justice advocates and labor unions.
The advocates sent a letter to Gov. Phil Murphy, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, and legislative leaders and gathered at the Statehouse Thursday to call on policymakers both to pony up the $30 million and to find a long-term funding solution that ensures child care is affordable and available for all who need it.
“New Jersey can’t claim to be the state that values working families if it’s willing to balance the budget on the backs of working families,” said Jason Ajiake, political director of labor union SEIU United Healthcare Workers East.
Michelle Stroud, a family child care provider in Toms River, said she has not passed the higher copays on to families whose children are in her care. Under the program, parents pay their share directly to the provider, while the program pays the provider for the rest of the cost of care. Both the copay and the subsidy rate are based on several factors, including a family’s size and income and the kind of care.
“I know how hard it is, so I take the hit instead of my parents,” Stroud said. “No one can afford this. Parents can’t afford the out-of-pocket cost. We can’t afford to give these discounts. Nobody wins.”
Murphy’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The program serves about 70,000 children from infancy to age 13 (or up to 19, for special-needs children) across the state, according to the state Department of Human Services. Families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level qualify for assistance; for a family of three, that’s about $53,000 a year.
“For many of our most vulnerable families, this program is the only path to affordable child care,” said Winifred Smith-Jenkins, director of early learning policy and advocacy of Advocates for Children of New Jersey.
The program got almost $80 million in additional funding in this year’s budget. But Sarah Adelman, the human services commissioner, testified during a May budget hearing that the allocation still would leave a $25 to $30 million budget gap, due to climbing enrollment and unfunded federal policy changes, such as a measure requiring the state to make enrollment-based payments before service is provided. She warned then that the department would have to freeze new applications and hike copays if the budget gap was not closed.
In their letter, advocates described the budget shortfall as a crisis that “demands a fundamental shift in how we value child care.”
“Child care is not a luxury; it is the workforce behind the workforce. It is critical public infrastructure, as essential to a functioning economy as roads and bridges. It is time to treat it and fund it as such,” they wrote.
Advocates noted that the rising costs of housing, health care, utilities, and groceries have dominated headlines this year, but child care costs have created “another affordability crisis.” A September brief by the Rutgers Child Care Research Collaborative found that 76% of New Jersey children under 5 are in non-parental care, with half of those families spending more than 7% of their annual income on child care (that’s the affordability threshold under federal guidelines).
The budget shortfall and program cuts it caused worsen inequities, because women of color are disproportionately represented among both parents and providers who rely on the program, advocates said.
“This is a worker issue, it’s a woman’s issue, it is a social justice issue, a racial justice issue,” said Trina Scordo, executive director of New Jersey Communities United.
Scordo applauded states that have “figured this out,” including New Mexico, which became the first state in the nation to offer free, universal child care this month.
“We’re a blue state. We are a wealthy state. That means we have the resources to figure this out,” Scordo said. “We can do this. It is not impossible. But it takes morality and courage.”
Two state legislators joined advocates at the Statehouse Thursday to cheer the cause. Sens. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) and Angela McKnight (D-Hudson) both have introduced bills to address sagging child care funding.

McKnight’s bill, which she introduced last month with Sen. Britnee Timberlake (D-Essex), would allocate $28 million to cover the program’s gap. It has no Assembly companion and awaits a committee hearing in the Senate.
Ruiz, who’s both a working mother and a former preschool teacher, called child care “a cornerstone of my policy agenda since before I got elected.” She has seven pending bills that would bolster child care in New Jersey, including one that would expand the income eligibility for child care assistance. That does have an Assembly companion, but neither chamber has yet advanced the bill.
“Government sometimes loses that common-sense approach. And unfortunately, we’re here because things happen, but it’s time for us to right the wrong,” Ruiz said.

A proposal to prohibit using SNAP to purchase sugar, spices and condiments reveals the far right's appetite for cruelty, writes guest columnist Lindsey Hanlon.
The post Meat loves salt, but does the Freedom Caucus love Wyoming? appeared first on WyoFile .","Let me tell you a story. There is an English fairy tale called Cap O’ Rushes that is strangely relevant to the most recent Freedom Caucus attempt to raise the bar on cruelty. In the tale, a wealthy man asks his three daughters how much they love him. The oldest two are extravagant in their praise, saying they love him more than life and more than all the world. The youngest tells him that she loves him “as meat loves salt.” Feeling insulted by the simplicity of her answer, the father kicks her out. 

Opinion

The usual fairytale hijinks follow, and in the climax, the daughter marries the prince and invites her father to the wedding without revealing her identity. For the wedding banquet, the new princess orders every dish made without salt. When they get to the meat course, it is so tasteless and disgusting that the guests can’t eat it. The father bursts out crying, realizing that “as meat loves salt” was a perfect encapsulation of his daughter’s love. Meat without salt is hard to eat, let alone enjoy. It needs salt to be a complete meal, just as the daughter needed her father to feel complete. (It all ends happily, don’t worry.) 
I thought about this fairytale as I read that Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams and the majority of the Joint Labor, Health, and Social Services Committee are willing to spend up to $3.1 million to prohibit Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, from covering a variety of foods — among them, salt. 
Salt, and many of the other items proposed to be off limits, like sugar, spices and condiments, are not “accessory foods,” as they were described in the meeting. They are what make food palatable. No human is a perfect automaton, able to persist forever on bland, perfectly balanced meals. We need a little seasoning. Food needs to nourish our souls as well as our bodies.
And what if we (as the Freedom Caucus folks so frequently encourage us to do while clutching their pearls) think of the children? After all, as we learned when Republicans froze SNAP benefits — in the month of Thanksgiving despite a $6 billion emergency fund — 44% of Wyoming’s SNAP beneficiaries are children. I’ve never met a child who didn’t go through at least one phase where a condiment was a major food group. You know the one where every essential food crucial to nutrition — vegetables, protein, even fruits and carbs — has to swim in an ocean of ranch or ketchup before the child even thinks about eating it. Rep. Rodriguez-Williams might think she is saying, let them eat carrots, but what she is really saying is that she doesn’t think enough about how people eat at all.
The Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program is, as its name suggests, meant to be supplementary. It’s possible that these legislators are picturing SNAP beneficiaries being able to use the money to “splurge” on things that would otherwise be beyond their means, like fruit, vegetables, and, of course, meat. But the reality is that for many beneficiaries, SNAP isn’t supplemental — it IS their food budget. With everything costing more, from medical care to housing and utilities, many families find themselves without a spot in their budget for food. There is no other pool of money for folks to use to get truly scandalous items, like mustard. Or, God forbid, the occasional candy bar. And with the Trump administration ballooning inflation at a rapid pace, the money provided by SNAP is already covering less and less, and folks are already being forced to make hard decisions about what to get. Why do we need to suck all the joy out of eating on top of these hardships? 
Meat loving salt is not just a fairytale or a metaphor. It is a physical reality of the meat of our bodies. A lack of sodium can lead to a condition called “hyponatremia,” which is a really good word to play in Hangman that means the body can’t regulate water well. Cells, including brain cells, start to swell. In mild cases, this leads to nausea, headaches and confusion. In “moderate” cases, muscles stop functioning correctly — they become weak, they spasm or they seize up in agonizing cramps. In more serious cases, it can lead to seizures or a coma. In the most serious cases, it results in death.
And if that isn’t a perfect reflection of the Freedom Caucus operating strategy, I don’t know what is. It’s members’ MO to cut Wyomingites off from vital resources that the Freedom Caucus considers “luxuries” and not realize their mistake until it results in pain or death for the people they claim to represent. Or worse, the Freedom Caucus members know those consequences will come and they cut off the resource anyway. 
Rachel Rodriguez-Williams and the Freedom Caucus do not love the people of Wyoming as meat loves salt, and it shows. With them in power, we will never get our happily ever after.

The projected deficit has increased from a month ago, when the state budget was projected to end the fiscal year with a $56.6 million deficit, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Overall, state revenues have come in below forecasts in three out of the first four months of the current fiscal year, state records show. 
According to the November edition of the General Fund Budget Monitor report published by the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office on Wednesday, total state revenue collections have come in $103.1 million, or 5.8%, less than the revised forecast issued by the Idaho Division of Financial Management. In addition to revenues coming in below budget projections, cumulative revenues have also come in $59.5 million, or 3.4%, below the actual revenue collections compared to the same time period last year, according to the General Fund Budget Monitor. 
When it comes to the bottom line, the state general fund is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a budget deficit of $58.3 million.
In interviews Thursday, two prominent legislators from two different political parties presented two very different assessments of the budget situation.

“It keeps me up at night,” said House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise. “I cannot underscore enough how dire the situation we are facing is.”
Rubel said 3% budget cuts ordered by Gov. Brad Little this summer are already causing harm to Idaho’s elderly, disabled and low income families. She predicted more cuts will be forthcoming, calling it “a catastrophe.”
 Idaho budget committee co-chair says Idaho won’t see a budget deficit

On the other hand, Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who co-chairs the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said the latest monthly budget reports show Idaho’s economy is healthy. She pointed out the state has record levels of savings accounts and cash reserves and said the largest tax cuts in state history are going to provide real benefits to Idahoans.
“We’re coming off the largest tax cut in state history and individual income tax collections are still up,” Horman said. 
“I am looking at the trends now, and we have one month up and three months under revenue forecasts, but the numbers are small. They are not off by hundreds of millions. By no stretch is revenue in a free fall – it isn’t.”

Horman said one revenue source – corporate income tax collections – are down by $58.3 million. That number is identical to the projected deficit of $58.3 million. 
“You can explain the entire variance simply with corporate income tax numbers,” Horman said. 
 Idaho legislators are required to pass a balanced budget

The Idaho Constitution requires the state to have a balanced budget and prohibits the state from spending more money than the amount of revenue that is collected.
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money the state takes in. Idaho’s largest sources of revenue are taxes, specifically individual income taxes, sales taxes and corporate income taxes.
The latest revenue report covers the first four months of the 2026 fiscal year.
“We will set a balanced budget,” Horman told the Sun on Thursday.  “The constitution requires it. I am personally committed to it. And I anticipate we will leave as large of a cash balance as we can to carry over into next year to guard against unforeseen circumstances. It was a wise decision to do it last year. And it will be a wise decision to do it again next year while still maintaining the core functions of government.”
 Projected budget deficit does not include impact of President Trump’s tax cuts

The projected budget deficit does not include the cost of paying for more than $100 million in supplemental funding requests the Idaho Legislature will consider in 2026. The projected deficit also does not include the cost of conforming to tax changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer.

The nonprofit Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy released a report Nov. 6 estimating that conforming to the personal and corporate tax changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could reduce Idaho revenue by an additional $284.4 million.
“Idaho’s lawmakers should ensure that our state revenue is protected to provide the public services that Idahoans rely on — like our education system, roads, and public safety,” said May Roberts, policy analyst for the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy. “Idaho’s budget should not take a hit to fund corporate tax breaks that primarily benefit businesses in other states.”
 Big budget decisions await Idaho Legislature in 2026

During meetings this month at the Idaho State Capitol, leaders of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, vowed that the Legislature will intervene to ensure the state ends the fiscal year with a balanced budget. 
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. 
Horman emphasized that Idaho is not now in a budget deficit, and the deficit is a projected forecast. What matters, she said, is where the budget actually stands when the 2026 fiscal year ends. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. That means that the current fiscal year 2026 ends June 30. 
The latest budget documents released by the state cover the months of July through October, representing one-third of the full fiscal year. 
The state’s projected revenue shortfalls are not limited to the current fiscal year. The gap between revenue projections and requested budget expenditures is projected to widen during the upcoming 2027 and 2028 fiscal years, according to budget documents presented to the Legislature’s budget committee earlier this month.  
One budget scenario that state staffers presented to JFAC last week showed an estimated budget deficit of $555.2 million – more than half of a billion dollars – for fiscal year 2027. 
Horman said that $555 million figure is just a projection and said the Idaho Legislature has never agreed to fund everything that the state agencies requested. 
The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Republican-controlled Legislature reduced state revenues by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for nonpublic school education expenses, including tuition at private, religious schools.
“Prior budget crises we have faced were due to the housing crisis in 2008 that we had to react to,” Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said in a text message to the Idaho Capital Sun last week. “This one is a direct result of the Legislature setting a questionable revenue projection in order to do tax cuts.”
Gov. Little sounded public warnings during the 2025 legislative session about the impact of revenue reductions on the budget. 
During a Feb. 25 breakfast with reporters, Little said he was not very happy about the reductions in state revenue.
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little told reporters Feb. 25.
In contrast to the $450 million worth of revenue reductions, Little proposed $100 in tax cuts and another $50 million for private school education initiatives in his January 2025 State of the State address. 
Despite his concern with the revenue reductions, Little did sign each of the tax cuts and the new private school education tax credit into law earlier this year. 
The 2025 legislative session begins Jan. 12 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The two top lawmakers in Tennessee’s House and Senate disagree with President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff on political corruption convictions.
Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, who serves as Senate speaker, said Thursday if he had been advising the president, he would have told him not to issue the pardons for Casada and staffer Cade Cothren.
“I just feel it was not correct,” McNally said.
Sexton reportedly told WBIR-TV in Knoxville the pair shouldn’t have been pardoned after being found guilty on multiple charges.
Despite some claims the case was pushed by the Biden administration, Sexton said the FBI started investigating Casada and Cothren during Trump’s first administration and then the Justice Department decided to go to trial this spring after Trump’s second term began. 
“That was their decision based on the evidence,” Sexton told WBIR-TV. “And then you had a Trump judge who presided over the case in Nashville.”
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson, a former FBI agent and assistant U.S. attorney, adjudicated the case and sentenced Casada to 36 months in prison and ordered him to pay a $30,000 fine for his role in a fraud and kickback scheme. Richardson sentenced Cothren to 30 months and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine.
Trump pardons former Tennessee Speaker Casada, ex-chief of staff

Both escaped punishment after Trump signed pardons late last week.
Despite the potential for presidential pardons, Sexton told WBIR his office will keep trying to get rid of corruption.
“We’re not going to turn a blind eye to it,” Sexton said.
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Smith was recently sentenced to eight months for her role in the scheme. She is seeking a presidential pardon according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
Casada and Smith concealed Cothren’s identity in the scheme because they felt lawmakers wouldn’t do business with their company if they knew the former chief of staff was involved. He resigned his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal that also engulfed Casada.

The protest was one of over 1,000 planned across the country. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado should aim to add 40,000 “attainable” owner-occupied homes and decrease costs for 100,000 renters by 2035, Attorney General Phil Weiser said Thursday, as his campaign for governor rolled out a housing platform he said would cater to the needs of all Coloradans.
“I want Coloradans to know that I am confronting this challenge with a sense of urgency, seriousness, and creativity, bringing bold leadership that will focus on this problem,” Weiser told Newsline an interview. “Whoever you are, a renter, you own your own home, you live in the urban areas, rural areas, our platform is comprehensive and addresses across the board. I’m the only candidate who can say that.”
Weiser’s proposed policies to increase housing stock and affordability in Colorado include speeding up construction permitting processes, streamlining government housing programs, supporting first-time home buyers and preserving existing affordable housing units for renters.

“When I talk to Coloradans, affordability, particularly with regard to housing, is often the first topic on their minds,” Weiser said. “It’s particularly a concern for key professionals, like teachers, law enforcement officers, and nurses who are having a harder time affording to live in communities where they work.”
If elected, Weiser would appoint a cabinet-level chief housing officer and create a state housing innovation team that would coordinate all state housing efforts. Currently, multiple state agencies work on housing policy, which Weiser said makes it “not always as coordinated or as focused.” For a large priority like housing, Weiser said it’s important to have a point person to lead and “help drive the sorts of outcomes we want.”
A housing innovation team would look for solutions that have worked in other cities and states and determine if any could work in Colorado. An example of that work could include looking at buildings school districts no longer use as an opportunity for employee housing. He also said that legislation to lower permitting fees for affordable housing projects, which are currently the same as fees for multi-million dollar homes, could incentivize more affordable construction.
He also wants to work against corporate landlord abuses, including junk fees and rent-setting algorithms, which he challenged as attorney general. The Colorado Legislature passed a bill banning the practice, but Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it. Weiser said he would have signed the bill into law, adding that his track record and expertise as attorney general show a “demonstrated commitment to standing up for consumers,” and he’d aim to continue that work as governor in collaboration with the next attorney general.
Weiser is running against U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet for the Democratic nomination for Colorado governor. Bennet announced his housing platform in September. Whoever wins the Democratic primary in June 2026 will likely be favored to win the general election. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election. 
Most of the state’s housing funds come from Proposition 123, a measure Colorado voters approved in 2022 that dedicates an additional $300 million annually to the state’s affordable housing efforts. It protects the additional revenue by exempting the funds from the annual limits set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, the 1992 state constitutional amendment that places restrictions on Colorado’s tax and spending levels.
The Colorado Legislature in recent years has passed several laws reforming land use policies in the state to encourage additional housing construction. That includes laws to streamline modular and manufactured housing, expand the parts of the state where accessory dwelling units are universally allowed, incentivize denser housing around transit hubs, and reduce litigation risks for construction defect claims. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has made “More Housing Now” a key goal throughout his second term as governor.  
Demographers estimate Colorado needs about 100,000 more units to meet the housing demand in the state.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Backing for Republican favorite Matt Van Epps and Democratic nominee Rep. Aftyn Behn is kicking into high gear in the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District seat as the Cook Political Report sees a shift in the political landscape.
The independent, nonpartisan group moved the district to “lean Republican” from “solid Republican” this week, mainly because of an 75% decrease in GOP turnout. Democrats, in contrast, are motivated to cast ballots in early voting, according to the report.
Van Epps is trying to counter by holding a tele-town hall Thursday with President Donald Trump, whose endorsement pushed him to victory in the Republican primary.
As voters started heading to the polls this week, a Florida-based political action committee called Engage, Y’all also spent more than $64,000 supporting Behn with Facebook posts, one about the importance of the race in changing the politics in Washington, D.C., where Republicans control Congress and the White House. 

In another post, the group accused Van Epps of supporting a law that increases health insurance and grocery costs while endangering nursing homes and causing more than 200,000 people to lose their health insurance.
The Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Votes Action PAC spent nearly $12,500 canvassing for Behn and putting out literature.
Van Epps, in contrast, has gotten only one independent expenditure in his favor, $31,000 from Special Operations for America, since he won the Republican primary in early October.
It could be that outside groups aren’t overly concerned yet about Van Epps, former General Services commissioner for Gov. Bill Lee, losing to Behn in a gerrymandered red district.
Yet former U.S. Rep. Mark Green, whose seat they are vying to fill, complained about the rejiggered 7th District because even though it stretches from the Alabama line to Clarksville, it takes in western Davidson County — a reliably blue area — which could come back to haunt Republicans.
Van Epps, a former Army helicopter pilot, last week released his first ad of the general election campaign, saying he didn’t risk his life for America “just to watch career politicians wreck it.” In the new spot, he said his next “mission” is to lower prices, reduce health-care costs and bring in jobs. 

It’s a far cry from the negative ad he directed at Behn when she bragged about going after ICE agents during a sweep for immigrants in South Nashville this year.
After casting an early vote Wednesday morning in Nashville, Van Epps spoke briefly to reporters, telling them he supports House Speaker Mike Johnson’s approach on handling the Epstein files, more or less slow-walking them through Congress.
Behn also unveiled her first campaign ad last week with a man riding a mechanical bull in slow motion and saying Washington’s system is “rigged” to help the rich with tax breaks and to bury the Epstein files. As the bull speeds up, she says regular folks get a “rough ride” because of tariffs and rising health insurance costs.
The East Nashville political organizer was supposed to have a big shindig last week with firebrand U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. Crockett canceled at the last minute due to what her office called scheduling issues, but Behn carried on with state Sen. Charlane Oliver and Crockett dialing in.
Behn is enjoying a bit of a bounce caused by Democrats’ election wins in Virginia, New York and New Jersey a week ago. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin canvassed with her last weekend.

The question is whether those can translate to Tennessee, where Van Epps has a built-in advantage. He got the endorsement of Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who put out a Facebook call for support.
It remains to be seen whether he will need independent expenditures from the School Freedom Fund, which backed him in the primary with more than $62,600 as he handily defeated a cast of Republicans.
One interesting note is that U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who refused to mention her last opponent, state Rep. Gloria Johnson of Knoxville, is blasting Behn constantly. Blackburn said in posts on X, formerly Twitter, that Behn and New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist and Muslim, are “cut from the same cloth” and want to return to Soviet-era policies. She also called Behn the “AOC of Tennessee,” saying she was dressing up on Halloween as U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat constantly targeted by Republicans for liberal stances.
Typically, it’s bad form to mention an opponent’s name because it lends credibility to their candidacy. In Tennessee it would typically take a lot of mentions, but some folks are starting to sweat.
Staying in the saddle?
Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, despite a series of foot surgeries and maladies, sounds like he’s gearing up for another campaign to serve in the District 5 Senate seat representing Anderson, Knox and Loudon counties.
McNally said Thursday, “I’ll probably make that decision a little later, but I fully planned on it.”
The Oak Ridge Republican is Tennessee’s longest-serving lawmaker. He won election to the House in 1978 and served four terms before capturing the Senate seat in 1986. He succeeded Ron Ramsey as Senate speaker and lieutenant governor in January 2017.

Amid talk that he might step away from the legislature, some senators have been jockeying for position to win the speakership for two years, especially after revelations that McNally posted comments next to risque photos on young gay men’s Instagram sites. He retained the speakership in a secret 19-7 vote in March 2023.
In the hunt early
Retired Tennessee Highway Patrol Capt. Mark Proctor is running as a Democrat for the 59th District House seat to be vacated by Rep. Caleb Hemmer.
Proctor worked for more than 25 years in the department, leading divisions on public safety, research and planning and training, in addition to protecting four governors.
“Serving and protecting is in my DNA,” Proctor said in a release. “After 25 years in law enforcement, my mission turned even more to raising my two daughters, volunteering in their schools, and running a small business. Now, I’m ready to serve and protect again — this time in the state legislature.”
He said he will concentrate on creating safer, stronger communities, giving families a boost and ensuring access to good schools, affordable health care and economic opportunities.
The district includes South Nashville, Forest Hills, Oak Hill and Brentwood.
Eviction ruling
Republican state Sen. Kerry Roberts is being forced out of a historic Springfield home after a judge ruled in favor of a bank that called in a $4.5 million note, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Sumner County Judge Kee Bryant-McCormick made the ruling in October, despite saying she felt Knoxville-based Apex Bank took advantage of Roberts and his wife after they borrowed the money to transform the 1860s-era home into a wedding venue with pools and gardens. They used the home and Airbnb parcels for collateral.
The dispute appears to center on the maturity date of the loan, which was originally to be October 2027. Apex moved it to January 2024, then extended it to March and May.
The senator, who is represented by state Rep. Gino Bulso, contended sluggish release of funds by the bank led to construction delays and his requests for extensions. But just as the project was nearing completion and he started to schedule weddings, he received a default notice, according to the report, and after foreclosing on the property, Apex sold it to another party for $5 million.
Roberts, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court last year, accused the bank of “predatory lending” and said he and his wife, Dianne, were heartbroken.
“It’s the place where I wanted to be buried,” he told the publication.
The bank denied the allegation and accused Roberts of trying to use his position as a senator to “intimidate judicial officials and spread misinformation.”
Roberts said he plans to appeal the ruling and file a lawsuit in Circuit Court.
No debating this one
Rutherford County Mayor Joe Carr was hospitalized this week at Vanderbilt trauma center with multiple injuries sustained while he and his son were training horses at his Lascassas farm in Rutherford County.
He sustained nine broken ribs, a lacerated liver and semi-collapsed lung in the incident. He was taken to a hospital in Murfreesboro (where he probably had to wait forever) before being transferred to Vanderbilt.

“This is the first time that I have spent the night in the hospital in 65 years,” Carr said. “I’m glad it was from something I love.”
A press release said both horses they were training are fine.
What I’m trying to figure out is how he got this far without spending one night in a hospital. I recall sitting up all night in the Stones River Hospital emergency room in Murfreesboro when my mother got sick. Getting old is tough, mayor.

(Photo: Greg Childress)This is the first of a two-part series on how one of the state’s most economically disadvantaged communities is trying to change its fortunes.
Seeds of hope are taking root in East Kinston, one of North Carolina’s poorest zip codes.
Kinston Teens, a youth-led nonprofit organization founded in 2014, has launched an ambitious plan to resurrect a community wracked by crime, generational poverty, sparse public investment and nearly decades-old natural disasters from which it has yet to fully recover.

Chris Suggs, 25, an East Kinston native and city councilman, founded the nonprofit when he was 14.  He said he was driven to do so by gun violence involving youth and gangs that had Kinston residents living in fear of being caught in the crossfire.
The gun violence sparked conversations and outrage among adults, but no one talked to the youth most affected by it, Suggs said. He was a ninth grader at Kinston High School at the time.
“All throughout the year [2014], we were having these issues of gun violence involving young people,” Suggs said, “our peers in school either shooting someone or getting shot.”
 A report released around that time by the UNC Center for Civil Rights, The State of Exclusion: Lenoir County, N.C.: An In-depth Analysis of the Legacy of Segregated Communities, was eye-opening, Suggs said. 
“The data showed us that the East Kinston neighborhood where so many of our volunteers and the young people impacted by gun violence lived had been ranked the No. 1 most economically distressed census tract in the entire state of North Carolina,” he said.
Three years after he launched Kinston Teens, Suggs, who graduated high school a year early, headed west to UNC Chapel Hill where he earned a political science degree. He served as senior class president and also started a nonprofit on campus.
Despite being advised by his parents and other relatives to move on from Kinston and make a better life elsewhere, Suggs returned home shortly after graduating from UNC Chapel Hill in 2021, and was elected to the Kinston City Council, hoping to make a difference. At the time, Suggs was the youngest elected official in the state.  
“I was born and raised in the most economically distressed neighborhood in our state, and then spent four years in Orange County, one of the wealthiest zip codes in North Carolina,” Suggs said. “I got to see the glaring disparity in what’s possible when you have a city and county government in Chapel Hill and Orange County that will lead the way, that put those catalytic public investments into housing and affordability and additional assets in food and public health.”
Suggs, who’s been a vocal critic of the lack of public investment in East Kinston, did not seek reelection, and his term on the city council will end next month. He believes his time is better spent focusing on the neighborhood he believes has been overlooked. 
“We [Kinston Teens] have been leading this work as an organization for 11 years, but particularly with a focus on East Kinston for almost seven years now,” Suggs said, “and there still hasn’t been a significant investment in either attention or money from local government officials here in Kinston.”
To avoid conflicts of interest, Suggs said, he’s been reluctant to ask for funding or support from colleagues, but expects that to change after he leaves the city council. His organization runs on grants and private donations.
Betting on the future
At the center of the fledgling renewal in East Kinston is the old abandoned and decaying Lewis School, which the nonprofit recently purchased for just under $17,000.

Suggs said there are no plans yet for the aging school building, but future uses could include housing, office space and community meeting space..
“We’ve started having some conversations about the possibilities for using the space,” Suggs said. “The classrooms, I think, are perfect sizes to be potentially reimagined as apartment homes and there’s such a need for housing and affordable housing here in Kinston.”
It’s not the first empty building he’s bought. When he was 17, Suggs used $850 in donations to buy an abandoned house that he transformed into the East Kinston Neighborhood Hub. It now provides community members with emergency resources, digital access, food support and civic programming. He’s also bought and refurbished a former church across the street from that house that serves as meeting space and is used for other activities such as game night.   
Buying the school, Suggs explained, was a strategic move that gives the neighborhood a say in what happens in East Kinston.

“We don’t want our property swallowed up by gentrification or outside investments,” Suggs said. “We want people right here in the neighborhood, in the local community, to be able to have our hands on those properties to stop displacement,” Suggs said, “and to make sure any development that happens in East Kinston works for us and not against us.”
While the community is “open and receptive” to talking to potential investors and developers, they must be willing to work with the community, Suggs said.
“When the opportunity presents itself for us to develop housing or an outside investor to come in and want to develop housing, we could say these are the terms and conditions that our neighborhood wants to see met,” Suggs said. “This is the percentage of housing, for example, that we want to be below the median income level for people who are families with young kids or for ill members of our community or people struggling to get back onto their feet.”

Lenoir County Commissioner Preston Harris, a retired educator who taught at Lewis School in the 1990s, said Suggs could use the building to house Kinston Teens’ current initiatives and to provide housing. 
“Two of our existing schools from the past have been transformed into senior apartments, and the other one is pretty much a section eight [apartment complex],” Harris explained, making it clear that he was speaking as a private citizen. “So those are possibilities.”
Harris said Kinston Teens is eligible for county grant opportunities to help fund improvement initiatives in East Kinston, although the nonprofit would have to compete with others for funding.
“We know that he’s [Suggs] doing great work with Kinston Teens,” Harris said. “They currently have renovated a couple of houses in that immediate community that have been dilapidated and some places that have been abandoned. We do see some private people coming into those houses and doing some work with them and getting them to the point where people want to move back into that area.”
Kinston is one of the poorest cities in the state. According to the U.S. Census data, 28.9% of the population live below the poverty line, which is more than double the 12.5% who live below the poverty line across the state, and the 12.4% who do nationally. 
In 2023, Kinston’s median household income was $35,250, while North Carolina’s was approximately $70,800. That means Kinston’s median household income is about half of the state median.

Theon Hardy, 89, a retired educator has lived in East Kinston all but about five years of her life, while she taught school in Henderson, N.C., after graduating from Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte in 1958.
Hardy said she was determined not to return home after graduating, but eventually did to care for aging parents. She still lives in the family home her father bought in the 1940s. She is proud of the single-story cottage-style home with its manicured yard that immediately stands out in a community where there is much blight.  
Hardy remembers when the streets of East Kinston were unpaved and when her family lived across the street from the city’s first Black policeman.
“I was going to get married and move out of the neighborhood and all, but I stayed here and kept making repairs to the roof and windows, and added on the den and stuff like that,” Hardy said. “So, why move, you know, unless I could find somebody to come and take me away, and that never happened.”
Hardy is excited about the current effort to revitalize East Kinston.
“Anybody my age that has seen teens gravitate to the good and not so good sometimes, I just feel proud to see somebody who shares interests in them and helps them to appreciate the neighborhood that they live in,” Hardy said. “It brings a smile and my jaws are rather tired, not from talking but from smiling.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSCN0851-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 06:58:00.148091

Many of the arrests made since the Memphis Safe Task Force began its work have been for traffic violations and drug charges, despite its stated focus on violent crime, according to new data shared with MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.
“This is supposed to be a ‘Make Memphis Safe Task Force,’ and really what it is, is a ‘Make Memphis Drive the Speed Limit Task Force,’” said General Sessions Court Clerk Tami Sawyer, whose office will make the data public through a new dashboard on Thursday.
So far, there hasn’t been an influx of new cases involving violent crimes, said Jonathan Bennett, associate director of the University of Memphis’ Center for Community Research and Evaluation. Bennett worked on the dashboard with Vishant Shah, chief data and analytics officer at the clerk’s office.
“The data shows there is an increase in traffic stop-related and narcotics arrests. Felony and misdemeanor arrests remain about 50/50,” Bennett said.
Currently, the dashboard only includes arrests leading to new cases, although the clerk’s office plans to add warrant data in the near future. Arrests stemming from pre-existing warrants are “likely a key focus of the task force’s efforts with respect to violent offenders,” Bennett said. The task force said Sunday that more than 1,000 of its 2,342 arrests were on preexisting warrants, but how many of those are for violent crimes remains unclear.










This is supposed to be a ‘Make Memphis Safe Task Force,’ and really what it is, is a ‘Make Memphis Drive the Speed Limit Task Force.


– Shelby County General Sessions Court Clerk Tami Sawyer


The Shelby County General Sessions Court’s new dashboard will live on shelbygeneralsessions.com, and will be updated weekly. The dashboard reflects what’s happening in Shelby County’s criminal justice system, including jail and court operations, amid the surge in policing from President Donald Trump’s Memphis Safe Task Force.
Sawyer said publishing the dashboard is a part of her office’s goal to be more transparent — especially since the U.S. Marshal’s Office, which oversees the task force, stopped reporting some information.
The data indicates that the county’s jails are being crowded with people arrested for narcotics- or traffic-related charges, Sawyer said. The two charges are often interconnected. For example, a highway patrol officer may pull someone over for speeding but also charge them with a drug-related offense if the officer finds marijuana in the vehicle.
“We already know the jail can’t hold the amount of people that are being detained,” she said. “We know intake can’t hold the amount of people that are being brought in every day. And while some of those arrest numbers have tapered off a bit, we can breathe today, (but) this weekend anything could change.”

According to the September jail report card, the downtown jail is overcapacity, holding 2,804 men. The report card showed 324 women in Jail East, which is near capacity.
The dashboard also shows misdemeanor citations, which officers can choose to issue instead of arresting people who they charge with misdemeanors. However, Shelby County is currently 70 to 80 days behind on digitizing Tennessee Highway Patrol tickets, so the data is incomplete, Sawyer said. As a result, there is currently no way to gauge how the task force is affecting those citations.
Because the highway patrol issues paper tickets to Memphis drivers and delivers hard copies of those tickets to the court, staff must enter each citation line-by-line into the county’s online system. Sometimes, the citations are difficult to read, causing additional delays, Sawyer said. People can’t pay their fines until the tickets have been entered into the system, she said.
“There’s no standard of how (citations are) written. Some of them are on printouts. Some are handwritten. If it got wet, if it’s been torn (or) crumpled up, that’s how they’re coming to us,” Sawyer said.
Sawyer’s staff had been reading and manually processing 1,500 citations per week since the highway patrol began its surge of enforcement in Memphis in June, she said. That pace has slowed since her office depleted its overtime budget trying to decrease the backlog, Sawyer said.
Right now, Shelby County is the only county in the state that inputs highway patrol citations manually, a process that predates Sawyer’s tenure as clerk. Other counties use the Tennessee Integrated Traffic Analysis Network, called TITAN for short, a statewide database of all traffic-related reports submitted by law enforcement agencies across the state, including the highway patrol. With this system, citations are uploaded online and available within the same day, she said.
Sawyer said Shelby County will begin using TITAN in mid-December, with no additional cost to the county or taxpayers because the system is free to use, Sawyer said. “TITAN should have been in play before I was elected,” she said. The database launched in 2008.
Once TITAN is implemented, the county will explore how artificial intelligence can be used to quickly input handwritten and printed citations online in order to clear the backlog, Sawyer said.
“Technology was not a priority for this office in previous generations,” she said. “I’m trying to update this office from 1975.”
The arrest data dashboard was originally created for the “Inter-Agency Justice and Operations Work Group,” composed of Shelby County government officials. The group first convened in September, when the criminal justice system saw “chaos” and disruption from the expected influx of task force activity, Sawyer said. The group’s goal is to coordinate and streamline criminal justice system operations.
Members of the group include county judges, representatives from the district attorney’s office, staff from the public defender’s office, the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, judicial commissioners and a county commissioner.

Sometime in the hours after last week’s election in Hamtramck, officials who weren’t involved in elections walked into the city clerk’s office, a space that’s supposed to be a secure place to keep ballots.
That revelation has thrown the outcome of the Michigan city’s entire election into doubt, including an exceedingly close mayoral race.
A total of 37 absentee ballots were initially unaccounted for on election night but were later discovered in the clerk’s office, opened but not yet tabulated. But since those ballots were not secured and could have been accessed by others, it’s currently up in the air whether they will be included in the election’s final totals.
The fate of the 37 ballots now rests with the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, which deadlocked on the decision Thursday and put off a resolution until Friday. City officials’ breach of the ballots’ chain of custody — a core safeguard in election law — has cast new doubt on the city’s election system, which is already under scrutiny amid ongoing criminal investigations and unusually high numbers of corrected absentee ballots.
How the canvassers rule on the 37 ballots could affect who wins the open-seat mayoral election in Hamtramck, a city of about 28,000 that borders Detroit. According to unofficial results, engineer Adam Alharbi currently leads City Council member Muhith Mahmood by only 11 votes.
 Ballots discovered after the election

City Clerk Rana Faraj told the board of canvassers on Thursday that her records showed a 37-ballot discrepancy on election night but that no one knew where the ballots were. They were found the next day in the clerk’s office, opened but still in their envelopes. When the discovery was made, the clerk immediately sealed the ballots in a secure envelope and brought them to the county, Faraj said.
The city clerk’s office is normally a secure space, so the discovery did not immediately raise questions about the ballots’ validity. However, Faraj said, her staff later realized several city officials, including interim City Manager Alex Lagrou, had entered the office while the ballots were there.
It’s unusual for non-election officials to go into a clerk’s office around an election, and it is not clear why they did so. Lagrou could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.
“This is an issue of election law,” said Lisa A. Capatina, the chair of the canvassers board. Capatina and Toni Sellars, the Republicans on the board, voted against tabulating the ballots, while Democrats Richard Preuss and Edward Keelean voted in favor.
The canvassers ultimately tabled the decision on the advice of Becki Carmargo, corporation counsel for Wayne County. They will reconvene on Friday afternoon. The state deadline for canvassing is Tuesday.
Preuss said he would love to hear from residents before making a decision.
“There seems to be a robust amount of people here at this meeting today that would like to have a chance to speak,” he said.
Those who spoke during public comment at Thursday’s board meeting were split. A number of self-identified Hamtramck residents said it would be wrong to disenfranchise those 37 voters, while others felt those ballots should no longer be considered after the chain of custody was broken.
 Investigations into Hamtramck elections

The revelation is yet another blow to election confidence in a city that has been racked by scandal. Several members of the City Council are being investigated for alleged election crimes, and one person who was also under investigation won election to the council last week. There have been accusations of ballot stuffing, intimidation, fraud, and more, including felony charges against council members.
Meanwhile, Faraj confirmed she has been on paid leave since Monday, which she told Votebeat on Thursday during the meeting was “for her safety.” She did not expand on what that meant.
Even if the 37 ballots are eventually counted, the election isn’t over. The city also has 120 “cured” ballots left to include in the final totals, Greg Mahar, the director of Wayne County elections, told the canvassers. That’s a significant number for a city of around 28,000 residents; Detroit, in comparison, had only 72 for a city of nearly 650,000.
Cured ballots are absentee ballots that weren’t counted originally because either the signature on the envelope was missing or it did not match the signature on file. In these cases, the clerk’s office reaches out to the voter and gives them until the Friday after the election to correct it, so their ballot can be counted.
It’s unclear why there were so many cured ballots in Hamtramck. Mahar attributed it largely to the open-seat race for mayor, but Detroit — which also had an open mayoral race — did not see the same spike.
“It is a bit unusual,” he told the canvassers.

Martha Layne Collins told political writer Bob Johnson “I have never been a pushy broad.” (Shelby County Historical Society)Martha Layne Collins, who died Nov. 1 and was interred Monday, was a good governor. She grew in office, advanced a state that greatly needed advancement, and provided important lessons for women in politics — as the state’s first female governor, one who allowed her husband to peddle influence.
Collins started out as a teacher, and as governor she set the state on the road to education reform. The progress in her 1983-87 term was aided by the national school-reform movement and paled in comparison to the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act, but the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence said the lawsuit that led to that landmark legislation was filed in “the education-focused atmosphere” that she helped create.
Her greatest legacy is making Kentucky a major automobile-manufacturing state, through recruitment of the Toyota plant to Georgetown. Yes, Toyota might have come if she hadn’t been elected — and if it hadn’t, some other Japanese automaker probably would have, if for no other reason than to get two more friendly U.S. senators. But speculation aside, Collins deserves credit for her leadership and salesmanship.
Martha Layne Collins, Kentucky’s only woman governor, dies at 88   

Larry Hayes, her Cabinet secretary, said in his eulogy of Collins that after Toyota initially passed up Kentucky in its search for a U.S. plant site, she called the company’s American sales chief, who got her a meeting with its top brass. They wanted “1,500 acres of free, flat land,” which the state didn’t have, but obtained with the help of Norfolk Southern Corp., whose railroad serves the plant, Hayes said. 
“She was really the one, with her personality and her ability to connect with some people . . . and her courage in taking the step” of giving land to a corporation, which the state constitution explicitly banned. State lawyers noted that, but “We kind of had to not listen to that part of it because she said ‘We’ve got to do this.’  She saw that,” Hayes said, adding later, “she truly cared about making things better for people.” A sharply divided state Supreme Court approved the deal a few months before Collins left office, and the state’s incentives to Toyota have long been accepted as a good investment in the state’s economic future.
The greatest blemish on Collins’ record was her husband’s 1993 conviction for extorting state bond underwriters, which sent him to prison and ended her political career. If she didn’t know what he was up to, as she averred, she should have known.
Bill Collins was part of a campaign team of old-school political operators and others who didn’t fit in the Democratic primary campaigns of Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane and former human-resources secretary Grady Stumbo. Though she became only the third American woman elected governor in her own right, Collins was the most traditional of the three Kentucky candidates. She relied on local politicians, personal connections and quiet but crucial help from Democratic U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford, in whose campaigns she had worked.
She was an adept, attractive and energetic campaigner, and as the first Kentucky woman with the chance to become governor, something of a curiosity. Women brought husbands to see her, and she won some over. A 1983 poll found that most people who said they voted for Collins also said they had met her — amazing at a time when the previous election seemed determined by television.
That election had been won by businessman John Y. Brown Jr., who loved national politics but seemed to think that local Democratic events were beneath him. Collins, as lieutenant governor, was the next option for most organizers. She turned many of them into supporters, and made enough people think she actually could be governor that she edged out Sloane by 4,532 votes. (She was accustomed to close elections; she won the 1979 lieutenant governor primary by 3,338 votes over favorite Bill Cox.)
Though Brown’s style helped Collins win friends, he left her with a legislature that was charting its own course after decades of domination by governors. Under Collins, it became all the more a broker of special interests, albeit with extra focus on issues she deemed important, such as education and workers’ compensation. She disliked the confrontation that forges compromise, but she and her associates said “her political style is too subtle to be measured by traditional standards,” as reported by Courier-Journal Political Writer Bob Johnson as she left office. She told him, “I have never been a pushy broad.”
Collins’ other important legacy remains unfulfilled. When she was governor, women held four of the seven statewide elective offices, and the age of women in Kentucky politics seemed to have arrived. But that majority hasn’t been repeated, and no other woman has been governor, or even nominated for the job. Bill Collins’ case may have had something to do with that, but I think it stems more from our state’s deeply traditional culture, which resurged in politics when Republican social issues drove the state rightward after the Collins years. The state was never more Democratic in voter registration than it was in the year she was elected.

Collins’ mentor Wendell Ford was elected governor in 1971 over Tom Emberton, who died in 2022 after serving as chief judge of the Court of Appeals. The day after Collins died, an Amanda Matthews bronze statue of Emberton was unveiled at the Metcalfe County Courthouse named for him. It was a friendly, bipartisan event, something all too rare these days — a tribute to Emberton, one of the nicest people ever in Kentucky politics. Former state Chief Justice Larry Van Meter said Emberton “had a magical way of bringing consensus.” We need more of that, too.

(Photo by Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)New qualitative research from University of Virginia professors and law students explores contributing factors to youth gun violence in Virginia as well as solutions at the state and local levels. 
“We shouldn’t be scared to walk around our own city without a gun,” said a 25-year-old Charlottesville resident interviewed as part of the research, which was released Thursday. 
That person was one of several minors and adults from around the state researchers interviewed to glean insights about what inspires people to carry guns and what might make their communities feel safer instead. 
The study builds on other research, like a 2024 study that revealed how teens exposed to neighborhood gun violence were more likely to begin carrying their own guns. For the UVA research, authors explored different hotspots around the state where homicide rates were higher. 
Lynchburg-area resident James Watkins, a longtime violence reduction and youth outreach strategist, conducted interviews with youth for part of the qualitative research and is one of the authors. 
At times in his own childhood, Watkins lived in high-violence areas before he found a sense of community and earned a scholarship to Virginia Military Institute where he eventually earned a psychology degree. His mentorship background and own lived experience, he believes, helped make the interviewees, whose identities the report kept anonymous, more comfortable. 
After the young people opened up and shared their experiences with him, Watkins said his takeaway is that adults should listen to minor’s perspectives when it comes to gun violence – from causes to engagement to reasons someone might have a gun in the first place. 
“If you don’t feel comfortable going to law enforcement or an adult (to resolve an issue), a kid is going to pick up a gun, because they’re accessible,” Watkins said. “They’re going to pick up a gun to protect themselves.” 
 Study shows what works, suggests further steps

The research points to several recommendations for actions that state and local governments can take to help drive down violence. 
As interviewees shared their insights living in areas where violence has been prevalent, they also shared how they think police could more meaningfully listen and engage with communities. A Hampton-area resident suggested officers seek local residents’ feedback for solutions in hotspot areas to help inform certain actions. 
Aside from law enforcement, the report also noted instances where civilians are stepping in to prevent conflicts from escalating to a need to call cops in the first place. 
The study’s authors also suggest local governments set memorandums of understanding with “organizations that employ people with lived experience.” 
One such organization is the Central Virginia Violence Interrupters, a nonprofit based in Charlottesville. The group, established by people with past criminal histories, seeks to help reduce violence and prevent crime through conflict mitigation and deescalation tactics. 
The idea is that people with the lived experience of doing time for crimes are well-suited to intervene to assist people on the verge of it. The once-volunteer cohort has been supported in recent years to treat their work as a part time job as they devote hours of time putting themselves in risky situations to benefit the overall community. 
City Council has appropriated funding to the organization in recent years and it had obtained federal grants, but the numbers have dropped this year as President Donald Trump’s administration cancelled grants or awarded them in other areas of the country. Additionally, Charlottesville has budgeted less for the group. The researchers suggest localities should continue to  support groups like the Violence Interrupters. 
“When we traditionally talk about safety, we’re thinking about potential victims. But we want potential offenders to feel safe too. That will make it less likely that they act in ways we all regret and they will regret,” said Andrew Block, one of the report’s authors and director of UVa’s State and Local Government Law Clinic. 
The research also points to successful state and local actions that can be continued. For instance, Hampton, Newport News and Norfolk have established interagency steering committees that share data on which areas of their towns are gun violence hot spots where intervention and public safety resources can be prioritized. 
As assistance to the research, an organization called Virginia First Cities Coalition hosted a virtual and in-person conference this past September with law enforcement leaders and violence interruption groups to share insights.
“Everybody has to play a role,” said Kelly Harris-Braxton, director of Virginia First Cities. “We’re all in this together.”
Law enforcement leaders discussed how they’d started devoting “the same level of investigatory resources to non-fatal shootings as they did homicides.” The approach led to quicker arrests and prevented retaliatory violence, the report stated, and was another recommendation for law enforcement around Virginia to implement. 
Harris-Braxton called it “refreshing” to see how energized the police chiefs in attendance at the conference were about reducing violence. 
Likewise, outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares’ Ceasefire Virginia program was noted as a success. The program, which invests in gang prevention and targets repeat offenders, has also distributed grant funding to violence intervention and youth mentoring groups around the state. 
When celebrating the program’s work last year with Virginia Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, Miyares said “you can’t just prosecute your way out” of violent crime. 
Continued funding for violence intervention programs and groups is a paramount recommendation from the UVA study for state government. The authors also suggest expanding the funding where possible and ensuring the funding is flexible as localities tap into grants. 
Authors also noted that Newport News-based Democratic Del. Cia Price’s effort to create the Virginia Center for Firearm Intervention and Prevention has previously passed the legislature but was blocked by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s veto pen. With Democratic Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger set to take the helm of the state next year, she could potentially sign it into law. 
The state’s gun storage safety laws could be bolstered, researchers said, some of which have been successful over the years, and others which have been vetoed. 
At local levels, the authors noted some holistic approaches that may help reduce gun violence in hotspot areas, such as investing in community centers and enabling school districts to address absenteeism. 
Both Harris-Braxton and Watkins emphasized that school or afterschool programs are places minors can find mentorship and friendship. 
“Some kids don’t have a stable family,” Watkins said. “There’s a void so they go searching for gangs for belonging but then they get sucked into the lifestyle.”
When speaking about the idea of community centers in an interview for the study, a Richmond-based young adult said that youth “are looking at their environment” and if violence and crime is what they see, they’re more likely to engage in it. A third space to connect with others and supportive environments can be nurturing, they said. 
“You don’t have to keep getting into this cycle of getting into these crimes, ending up in the jail cells, then not being able to find a job and then again, back to crime and falling into jail,” they said. 
By exploring ways to prevent gun violence in the first place and how to address it when it arises, Block explained that state and local actions can achieve  synergy and progress. 
“If we think about this mass problem of youth gun violence on a more local level and almost micro level, it becomes a much more solvable problem,” Block said.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia will delay raising its academic benchmarks in reading and math until the following school year — a pause that gives teachers and school divisions a brief breather before higher proficiency standards take effect. 
On Thursday, the Virginia Board of Education endorsed a four-year phased plan to raise expectations set by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration. The goal is to better align the state’s benchmarks, or cut scores, with the rigor of the National Assessment of Educational Progress  and help students improve their thinking problem-solving skills.
Critics have said for months that while they understand the need for higher expectations, they worry shifting cut scores could lower graduation rates, increase teacher burnout and worsen inequitable access to education. Others, however, spoke in support at Thursday’s meeting.
Youngkin’s education board moves to toughen proficiency standards

“When standards stay low, the least advantaged children lose the most as they depend the most on the public school system for their education,” said parent Todd Truitt.

He added that “many of these least advantaged kids in Virginia graduate believing they are prepared, only to find out later that the world expected more of them.”
This school year will serve as a preparation year, with the proficient cut score staying at 400 before rising to 446 by the 2028-2029 school year. Virginia will begin gradually increasing cut scores starting in 2026-2027.
Under the board’s plan, students retaking an SOL assessment must meet the passing score that was required when they first took the test.
Students who have already demonstrated proficiency on high school end-of-course assessments — whether in middle or high school — will not be required to retake the test or the course. The board also directed the Virginia Department of Education to release updated student assessment reports next spring for parents and school divisions, intended to help meet the board’s goals for higher expectations.
Groups including the Virginia Association of School Superintendent had asked the board to extend the existing proficiency and graduation requirements for all high school students, not just seniors. But the board took no action, with staff saying they are following the precedent of modifying cut scores without altering graduation requirements. 
Board Member Ida Outlaw McPherson emphasized the need to support disadvantaged students as they prepare for college, sharing that she herself had not been ready in certain subjects — something she said might have derailed her plans to pursue a political science degree. 
“Fortunately, I was able to overcome it, but that’s why it’s very important to me that we raise the level as quickly as possible so the students never have to face that,” McPherson said.
Since September, VDOE has met with school leaders to discuss concerns over how the proposed cut scores would affect their divisions, providing modeling and impact analyses.
Scott Brabrand, VASS executive director, said members “strongly appreciated” and “support your total four-year phase-in approach to intentional transition planning,” which will allow for additional modeling by VDOE and school divisions.
The vote caps a years-long process that drew heightened attention in the spring, when a standards-setting committee of teachers and instructional personnel began developing recommendations.
Virginia Explained: The debate over student expectations

On Oct. 24, Youngkin asked the board to raise achievement expectations and cut scores — particularly for grades 3-8 reading and math SOLs — following the release of 2022 NAEP results that showed declines in Virginia across both subjects between 2019 and 2022, and continuous drops in fourth-grader proficiency dating back to 2017.
The administration asked the board to reverse cut scores lowered by a previous board, which “inflated the perception of proficiency and ultimately led to some of the worst learning losses in the country,” according to the agency’s presentation.

Mim Luangraj, a resident in Arlington, said parents — including those from working families and those who speak English as a second language — likely do not know where standards should be set for college and career readiness.
“As a product of that community and on behalf of those that can’t advocate for their own children, I’m here today to say it’s crucial that their children receive an education at schools with high academic expectations and real opportunity — because for many of them, that’s the only place they’ll get it,” Luangraj said.
Board Vice Chair Bill Hansen was absent from the 8-0 vote by the Youngkin-appointed board.

(Photo by Alan MacRae/New Hampshire Bulletin)This is the third in a three-part series on New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. You can read Part I here, and Part II here.
IN 1956, A DOCUMENTARY titled “Help Wanted” placed viewers inside the Laconia State School, which from its founding in 1903 as the New Hampshire School for the Feeble-Minded to its closure in 1991 housed people with disabilities.
So disturbing were the visuals that the Portsmouth Herald compared the institution to images of the concentration camps of Nazi Germany.
Overcrowding plagued the New Hampshire facility, with over 1,000 residents by 1942, according to a historical account from the Laconia Daily Sun. There was no privacy or personal space in the group bedrooms — and in one building a single toilet was shared among 80 people. Many residents were forcibly sterilized, and beatings were routinely given as punishment for bad behavior.
For nearly a century, the institution served as the state’s response to the needs of people with disabilities. It took a class-action lawsuit — and its articulated horrors — to shutter the place for good and usher in a new system for state-administered care more than three decades ago.
But as a monthslong Bulletin investigation into New Hampshire’s modern disability care network has revealed, systemic problems of abuse and neglect haven’t gone away. Tragic story after tragic story — many of them reported this week for the first time — provide the evidence.

After the November 2017 assault, the 26-year-old victim — who remained anonymous in the court filings, press reports, and other materials describing the crime — was bleeding, had vomited, and called his mother from the bathroom to tell her he’d been raped. She told officers her son had the mental capacity of a 15-year-old.
Jordan is currently serving a 10-year sentence at the New Hampshire State Prison for Men in Concord, according to the Department of Corrections website.
Jordan and the victim lived in a Manchester home operated by Community Integrated Services, which was overseen by the Moore Center, a Manchester area agency designated by the state to coordinate care for people with disabilities. 
A lawsuit filed in October 2019 by the victim’s family alleges that neither Community Integrated Services nor the Moore Center did a background check on Jordan before hiring him to live with and care for the young man. In 2014, Jordan was convicted of driving while intoxicated, which is legally disqualifying to serve as a caretaker for people with disabilities, and charged with unlawful possession of a weapon. The lawsuit claims Community Integrated Services and the Moore Center were made aware of the charges by the home’s landlord, who had discovered them during a background check.

Still, neither agency fired Jordan nor removed the young man from his care.
In the weeks leading up to the assault, the victim’s mother reportedly witnessed Jordan belligerently intoxicated, per the lawsuit, but Community Integrated Services denied he was drunk, arguing he was on medication that prevented him from drinking alcohol. The mother reportedly asked them to install a video camera in the apartment to monitor Jordan and was told it was “in the works,” the lawsuit alleged.
Community Integrated Services and the Moore Center didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment or an interview.
Jordan’s crime played out publicly in court and was widely reported in the state’s press. However, a Bulletin investigation found that Jordan’s assault was not an isolated incident within New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system — that acts of violence, negligence, and exploitation are common. Many never make it to court or are settled behind closed doors with parties unable to speak of the outcomes. Others take years for the state to fully investigate.
In New Hampshire, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are entitled to services. The state designates 10 area agencies, including the Moore Center, to either provide this care or subcontract with another vendor agency, such as Community Integrated Services, to do so. The area agency system, established in the wake of the Laconia State School, is overseen by the state’s Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services and is paid for by Medicaid and other state and federal dollars.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte, shown here talking to reporters on Oct. 15, told the Bulletin on Nov. 12 she’s been in communication with the commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services and attorney general about systemic issues raised in the Bulletin’s reporting. She said she will “continue to make sure that these are investigated, that we follow through with any changes that need to be made to the system.” (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Gov. Kelly Ayotte told the Bulletin on Wednesday that after the first two parts of this series were published, she reached out to DHHS Commissioner Lori Weaver and Attorney General John Formella to discuss the issues raised.
“These are very serious allegations,” Ayotte said. “They need to be examined, and we need to make sure that the system is serving the people that have disabilities in our communities, and also any of the contractors, the area agencies that contract with the state to serve people with disabilities, make sure that they are performing and that they are treating people well, so I take this very seriously.”
She said she will “continue to make sure that these are investigated, that we follow through with any changes that need to be made to the system.”
New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver, shown here during an Oct. 15, 2025, Executive Council meeting, declined the Bulletin’s requests for an interview. Bureau of Developmental Services Chief Jessica Gorton and Director of Long Term Supports and Services Melissa Hardy also declined. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The Bulletin repeatedly requested interviews with Weaver, Bureau of Developmental Services Chief Jessica Gorton, and Director of Long Term Supports and Services Melissa Hardy to discuss issues within New Hampshire’s disability system. The three declined. Jake Leon, director of communications for DHHS, instead provided a statement.
“While we are unable to comment on individual cases, DHHS has a process in place to review and investigate complaints made against providers and vendors licensed or certified through the Department,” he wrote. “We take these allegations seriously and will continue working to ensure Granite Staters with disabilities are protected and that allegations are thoroughly investigated.”
Rampant abuse and neglect
State records obtained by the Bulletin show New Hampshire investigated 1,405 reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation committed against people with disabilities in the state’s intellectual and developmental disability system from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025. 
Those reports include allegations of physical attacks, sexual abuse and assault, and verbal attacks committed by staff against people with disabilities in their care. Of the reports, 467 were deemed credible after a state investigation, according to the records, while 18 of the complaints were withdrawn before the investigations were complete and 28 complaints were ongoing when the records were produced.
State records also show 119 people died in New Hampshire’s disability system from 2023 through June 2025. Of those deaths, 79 were deemed “anticipated” by the state (state officials refused to define “anticipated” for the purposes of these records) and at least 22 were categorized under “unknown” cause of death. The causes of death in the records include “intracranial hemorrhage” (brain bleed), complications from a “right femur fracture,” and “probable bacterial infection, and malnutrition.” 
BDSMortalityReportSept2022throughJune2025
 This mortality report, obtained by the Bulletin through an open records request, details deaths within New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. The state declined to provide more documentation to add context to the nature of the deaths.
No further information is included in the records that would provide more context, and the state declined to provide the Bulletin with further documentation on the deaths even with personally identifying information redacted, citing state statutes.
News reports from other states — including Missouri, West Virginia, and California — suggest New Hampshire is not entirely unique, as abuse and neglect have been reported elsewhere. Additionally, the Bulletin collected data from neighboring states on their developmental disability systems through a series of open records requests. However, differences in how data is categorized and reported — as well as population variations — make comparisons with bordering states challenging.
In Vermont, 92 people died within the state’s intellectual and developmental disability system in 2023 and 2024, according to state records. In Massachusetts’ system, 730 people died in 2023 and 2024. Massachusetts categorized the deaths even further: 18 were determined to be accidental, one cause was undetermined, and 21 were still pending investigation earlier this year when the records were produced. The remaining were attributed to natural causes. In Maine’s system, 112 people died in 2023 and 2024, per state records. Of those deaths, three were accidental and 56 were attributed to “unknown causes.”
As for abuse and neglect, Vermont saw 680 instances of “alleged abuse, neglect, and prohibitive practices” and 254 “criminal acts” in 2023 and 2024, per state records. In Massachusetts, records show 11,652 complaints of abuse and neglect in 2023 and 2024. And in Maine, there were 370 complaints of abuse and neglect in 2023 and 2024. 
Looking forward
Jim Piet, who has cerebral palsy and serves as vice chair of the New Hampshire Council on Developmental Disabilities, said he’s “not surprised” to hear of abuse within the care system and has experienced yelling and threats from caregivers himself.

The Council on Developmental Disabilities is a federally funded agency independent of state government that advocates for people with developmental disabilities. Piet said DHHS provides so little data and information that it makes it impossible for his council to meaningfully offer recommendations or identify issues.
Piet said the market to hire caretakers is so difficult that some people with disabilities or agencies put up with abusive or neglectful behavior because they’re afraid of not being able to find a replacement. He said low wages, minimal benefits, and little opportunity for career advancement for these employees sometimes leads to lower quality employees.
“Abuse can look like lots of different things,” Piet said.
State Sen. David Rochefort, a Littleton Republican and chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said he was unaware of the abuse and neglect cases before hearing about them from the Bulletin. That’s “unsettling to hear,” he said.
David Rochefort
“As someone who lived through the clergy abuse of 20 years ago,” he said, “there’s been past instances where things like this have been covered up, and this can’t be covered up. It has to be brought out into the open and people need to have the justice that they deserve. Everybody deserves justice, but this is such a vulnerable community that are so dependent on others. I would certainly support anything that would protect them.”
He said it’s important for lawmakers to look for breakdowns in the system.
“My first initial thought is, how did these cases get to this point,” he said. If there were breakdowns, he said, “then we can dig into that a little bit and find out what in the process failed these people, and look to make adjustments there.”
He said in other interactions he’s had with the area agency system, he’s wondered if there needs to be more oversight on area and vendor agencies.
“We want people to get the best care that’s available, especially a very at-risk population,” Rochefort said. “But we want it done right, and we want it done safely, and if there’s areas that need to be addressed, hopefully we can address them, but the proliferation of these private vendors just makes you wonder, are we doing enough to vet these these places and are they providing the best care that’s possible?”

 How did the Bulletin report this story?

	
Over the course of months, the Bulletin sifted through thousands of pages of state records, court filings, and law enforcement documents, and interviewed dozens of family members, advocates, attorneys, and others. To see a selection of the most noteworthy documents click here.

Stephanie Patrick is the executive director of the Disability Rights Center-NH. This federally designated agency is tasked with investigating suspected abuse and neglect in New Hampshire; pursuing litigation on behalf of the state’s disability community; assisting people trying to receive services for their disabilities; advocating for people with disabilities; and working with lawmakers on solutions to problems facing the disability community.
“It doesn’t seem clear that there’s a path forward,” Patrick said. “I think there’s potential to make systems better. People do that all the time. We, the state of New Hampshire, are hopefully constantly looking at how to make systems work better to meet the needs of the people that they are supposed to serve. But I don’t know how you do that if you don’t want to talk about it.”
Patrick said nothing will change until state leaders are willing to be frank about what’s going on and commit to changes. She called it “unacceptable” for the state to delegate responsibility for abuse and neglect to private agencies.
She said high-level elected officials need to call for evaluations of the Department of Health and Human Services’ licensing and certification officials, its investigations teams, and adult protective services. Those groups need to “work together to address systemic failures instead of operating in silos or blaming one another.”
Patrick also said lawmakers need to devote more funding to ensure quality services and staff to monitor the conditions of residential programs.
“It is challenging because there are not enough providers,” Patrick said. “But to me, it’s worse to have poor quality providers than to not have as many as you want. A healthy system involves setting real true expectations for the kind of care that people get and holding providers accountable.”
Patrick said the state needs a full investigation conducted by an independent agency separate from the state.
“Civil lawsuits for damages provide resources for the abused person with disabilities and bring some solace to families,” she said. “Criminal charges can hold the perpetrators accountable. But neither actually forces the state and its Medicaid providers to actually examine the systems that led to these failures.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lakesfacilityvetting-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

(Photo from Google Maps.)As it was in the midst of financing a $61 million bribery scheme, Akron-based FirstEnergy also improperly claimed millions in construction expenses, according to a new report. 
The company classified lobbying and donations as construction expenses at the same time that it funded the bribery scandal, although it’s not clear if any of that money was paid in bribes.
Now that $108 million in such errors have been found, the utility is asking Ohio regulators for permission to charge its customers for them. 
Otherwise, they’ll be billed to FirstEnergy shareholders — which prominently include the company’s own executives.
Corruption surcharge
Ohioans are already frustrated with skyrocketing utility costs. 
Due in part to AI-driven demand for data centers, monthly utility bills were up $32 on average this summer compared to 10 years ago, Signal Cleveland reported.
But Ohio customers also have faced a sizable surcharge for corruption over the past decade. 
In 2023, former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder, R-Glenford, was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for his role in a conspiracy in which FirstEnergy paid $61 million in bribes to get a $1.3 billion ratepayer bailout. 
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones and Vice President Michael Dowling face felony charges in the same scandal.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Most of the bailout money was intended to prop up money-losing nuclear plants owned by FirstEnergy. It was repealed after the FBI made its first arrests. 
But it wasn’t until five years later that the Republican-led legislature repealed a coal bailout benefitting a group of Ohio utilities that was part of the same 2019 legislation. 
By that time, ratepayers had already been forced to pay more than $500 million that won’t be refunded.
That’s all in addition to $1.5 billion that electric utilities have been allowed to collect since 2009 in charges that the Ohio Supreme Court later deemed to be illegal. 
But because the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio greenlit the charges without creating a refund mechanism, customers won’t get that back either.
Underwriting incompetence
Now a new report by the Energy & Policy Institute has flagged another way FirstEnergy might be trying to profit improperly. 
A FirstEnergy spokeswoman didn’t respond to calls and emails requesting comment for this story. 
As revealed in court documents and testimony in the fallout from the scandal, by 2016, company leaders’ poor business decisions had made them desperate. 
They were heavily invested in aging coal and nuclear plants, fracking had made gas-fired electricity generation much cheaper, and they couldn’t compete. 
So they went looking for a way to force customers to bail them out.
FirstEnergy started courting Householder at the World Series in Cleveland that October, and by flying him on the corporate jet to Donald Trump’s first inauguration the following January. 
Using FirstEnergy money, Householder and his allies were elected, he became Ohio House speaker at the start of 2019, and he shepherded the bailout through the legislature later that year.
The FBI arrested Householder and four others in July 2020. Two of his codefendants later died by suicide.
Construction? Or lobbying?
Auditors later found that concurrent with the scheme, FirstEnergy had engaged in another practice that — regardless of whether it was intentional — worked to the company’s financial advantage.
A 2022 audit by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found that from 2015 to 2021, FirstEnergy incorrectly classified millions spent on things like lobbying, advertising, and political donations as construction costs. 
That’s important, the Energy and Policy Institute Report said, because utilities are allowed to collect a profit from ratepayers on their construction investments. 
They’re not allowed to collect such profits for money they spend on lobbying and political donations.
“Utilities are supposed to fund lobbying and donations with shareholder money because these expenditures primarily benefit shareholders and do not benefit ratepayers,” the report said. 
However, the federal audit found lots of claimed construction expenses that had almost nothing to do with actual construction.
“For example, audit staff found that some employees spent 5% or less of their time performing work that supported the FirstEnergy subsidiaries’ construction operations, but had more than 90% of their labor and related costs capitalized as a cost of construction,” the audit said.

Construction? Or bribes?
Some of those misclassified dollars might have been used in the bribery scandal. 
The Energy and Policy Institute report cited a 2024 utilities commission audit. It said that FirstEnergy claimed as a construction expense $2.5 million that was part of a $4.3 million bribe paid to Sam Randazzo.
Randazzo played a pivotal role in the bribery scandal, starting shortly after the Nov. 6, 2018 elections.
On Dec. 18, 2018, FirstEnergy execs Jones and Dowling met with Gov.-elect Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov.-elect (and now-U.S. Sen.) Jon Husted at the Columbus Athletic Club. 
They discussed whether the executives wanted Randazzo to regulate their massive electric utility, according to a state indictment. 
Jones and Dowling then drove about a mile to Randazzo’s German Village condo and negotiated the $4.3 million bribe, the indictment said.
DeWine appointed Randazzo to the state’s top regulatory spot a few weeks later. 
It was a perch from which Randazzo helped write the corrupt energy bill that FirstEnergy paid huge bribes for.
The $2.5 million part of the bribe for the future regulatory chief was itself part of $6.45 million that FirstEnergy paid to a group controlled by Randazzo. 
The company then classified the money as a construction expense, the Energy and Policy Institute Report said. 
After being arrested, Randazzo died by suicide in April 2024.
Dunning ratepayers, not stockholders
As a consequence of the federal audit’s findings, FirstEnergy reclassified $108 million in claimed construction expenses as “miscellaneous deferred debits.”  
Now, even though some of the funds were apparently used to improperly profit from ratepayers, FirstEnergy is asking to bill those same customers for the whole shebang. 
It’s part of a request to the utility commission to pass on $190 million in additional costs to ratepayers.
In its annual 2024 10-K report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, FirstEnergy said it “has accepted” the findings of the 2022 federal audit. But it added that it hopes the company’s owners won’t have to shoulder them.
If the Public Utilities Commission doesn’t allow it to bill ratepayers for charges that the audit said were improperly accounted for, it would “have an adverse impact on FirstEnergy’s financial condition,” the filing said.
In other words, shareholders instead of customers would be left holding the bag. And that would cost the FirstEnergy brass, as opposed to their ratepayers, who have no choice about whether to use the company’s distribution system.

For example, total compensation for FirstEnergy CEO Brian X. Tierney was $26.5 million in 2023, Axios reported. 
To give an idea just how much that is, assume Tierney works 70 hours a week. That would mean he was paid $7,280 an hour, or 219 times the average hourly wage of his Ohio customers.
And a huge portion of Tierney’s 2023 pay — more than $22 million — was in the form of company stock, which would take a hit if something “had an adverse impact on FirstEnergy’s financial condition.” 
The state’s official consumer advocate, the Office of Consumers Counsel is urging the public utilities commission to make FirstEnergy’s owners pay for errors made by the people they pick to run the company.
“Consumers shouldn’t pay for FirstEnergy’s mistakes. Both the independent auditor and OCC’s expert agree that FirstEnergy’s $108 million ‘fix’ for its own error was improper,” the agency’s head, Maureen Willis, said in an email. 
“FirstEnergy caused the problem — now it’s trying to make consumers clean it up. The record points the other way: FirstEnergy consumers deserve a rate cut, not another hike.
Willis added, “The PUCO should stand with consumers, not FirstEnergy.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Firstenergy-mug-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

Wes Moore spent a few minutes sorting donated food before signing an executive order in late October declaring a state of emergency to allow for distribution of food aid. As the federal government reopens, questions remain about how states will be reimbursed for the costs they incurred. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Though Congress ended the record-setting federal government shutdown, many questions remain for states that were already wading through seismic federal changes.
One major uncertainty: whether and how states will be reimbursed for the costs they incurred, as they have been in previous shutdowns. And for the longer term, the shutdown offered a glimpse into the funding challenges facing states. They’ll have to rely more on their own money and staff to keep federal programs going even at a time when many face their own budget problems.
That’s a top concern for the federal food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Amid conflicting federal guidance during the shutdown, states reacted in different ways: Some issued partial benefit payments, others sent aid to food banks to keep people from going hungry.
But even after the government reopening restores SNAP aid, other challenges loom. The major tax and spending law enacted this summer tied SNAP funding to state error rates, which measure the accuracy of benefit payments. Advocates fear the shutdown will increase error rates because of conflicting federal guidance.
Air travel, SNAP benefits, back pay at issue as federal government slowly reopens

“States are really worried,” said Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit working to address poverty-related hunger.
And states have been rushing to inform rural residents, veterans and older adults that they will soon be forced to meet work requirements or lose SNAP benefits. It’s just the first in a wave of cutbacks to the nation’s largest food assistance program required under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July.
FitzSimons said the shutdown highlighted the importance of SNAP and how “untenable” many of the upcoming changes will prove for states. For now, states are working to get benefits to people immediately, and then will focus more on questions of reimbursement and ongoing changes to SNAP.
“The hope is that states will be able to move quickly and then turn their attention to all the changes,” she said.
While public attention has centered on the shutdown chaos in recent weeks, more fundamental changes are occurring outside the spotlight, said Eric Schnurer, founder and president of Public Works, a consulting firm specializing in government performance and efficiency.
“The ground is shifting under their [states’] feet even as this goes on,” he said. “Even if the Trump administration and his policies were to pass on in another three years, there are serious structural changes in the relationship between state and federal government.”
Since taking office, the Trump administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. And the president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandates deep cuts to social service programs, including Medicaid and food stamps.
Under the law, states will be required to pay a greater share of administering SNAP in the coming years. That requirement, along with eligibility changes, could result in millions of Americans losing benefits.
“I think the public in general got a taste of what that might look like over the past month,” Schnurer said, referencing the shutdown’s first-ever disruption to SNAP benefits.
State-federal strain
The legislation to reopen the government approved by Congress and signed by the president this week says that states shall be reimbursed for expenses “that would have been paid” by the federal government during the shutdown.
“So that sounds promising for states,” said Marcia Howard, executive director of Federal Funds Information for States, which analyzes how federal policymaking impacts states.
But it’s unclear how that language will be interpreted. For example, states that sent money to food banks for emergency food assistance are less likely to be made whole compared with states that sent funds through existing federal programs like SNAP, she said.
Veterans, rural residents, older adults may lose food stamps due to Trump work requirements

California dedicated $80 million in state funds and deployed the National Guard to food banks across the state. But Virginia launched a temporary state-level version of the federal food stamp program.
Previous administrations have been more flexible with federal funds, making it easier for states to receive funding or reimbursement, Howard said.
“This administration is really more holding states’ feet to the fire perhaps than other administrations have. So I think they’ll be less permissive in who and how they reimburse,” she said.
It could take weeks or months before states know the full fallout from the shutdown, especially with food assistance.
“[States] did such different things, and I think there’s going to be a fair bit of back-and-forth: should this be covered? Should this not be covered?” Howard said.
The shutdown and its aftermath underscore the ongoing strain between state and federal governments, said Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University in New York.
Federal uncertainty can cause state leaders to be more cautious about their own budgets — similar to how an economic downturn can decrease consumer spending, she said.










In some ways, even though the shutdown is over, things are not going to go back to ‘normal.’


– Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University


“There’s a delay of services, there’s a diminishment of capacity and partnership, and those things might be harder to quantify when you’re talking about what is the cost of the shutdown,” she said. “But I think those are real costs.”
And the end of the shutdown does not extinguish those tensions.
“In some ways, even though the shutdown is over, things are not going to go back to ‘normal,’” she said.
More changes coming
Aside from spending cuts and new administrative costs, Trump’s July law made major tax code changes poised to cost many states, said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that supports public sector workers.
Most states use the federal tax code as a basis for their own income tax structures, so changes at the federal level can trickle down to state tax systems or states can choose a different structure to avoid those changes.
Last month, a Massachusetts budget official said federal tax changes would cost the state $650 million in revenue this budget year.
So even with the government back open, states have to plan for some level of unpredictability, Glasgall said. And the future of entire agencies like the Department of Education remain up in the air, he noted.
“So there’s still a lot of uncertainty, even with this bill,” he said.
‘This shutdown feels different.’ States might not get repaid when government reopens.

On Wednesday, state budget analysts briefed Maryland lawmakers on the $1.4 billion budget gap they could face as they head into the 2026 legislative session.
That figure does not include the fallout from the federal government shutdown, which may not be known for months, according to Maryland Matters.
In late October, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore declared an emergency and directed $10 million in state funds toward food banks and pantries. Earlier this month, he announced $62 million in state funds would be deployed directly to SNAP recipients.
Rhyan Lake, a Moore spokesperson, told Stateline that Maryland expects the federal government to reimburse the state for its SNAP expenditures during the shutdown.
But lawmakers are still gearing up for a hit from major federal changes.
In addition to cuts from Trump’s domestic tax and spending law, Maryland has lost about 15,000 federal jobs, budget officials said. But many federal workers who took buyouts were paid through September. And the shutdown caused a pause in federal employment data, potentially concealing the true impact.
State Sen. James Rosapepe, Democratic chair of the joint Spending Affordability Committee, said he’s worried the state has only seen the beginning of its federally induced fiscal challenges. He also noted that this week’s shutdown-ending legislation only assures the government remains open through January, meaning another shutdown could be just a couple months away.
“We’re less than a year into the administration, and the effects of things they’ve already done don’t seem to have flowed through yet to the data that we have, which leads me to believe that the worst is yet to come,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-14 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Today, the curtain goes up on Ned Lamont’s bid for a third term",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/14/gov-lamont-reelection-third-term-announcement/,Gov. Ned Lamont has events planned Friday to define himself as central to continuing a fiscal recovery brought to life on his watch.,"On his first day as a formally declared candidate for reelection to a third term, Gov. Ned Lamont has events planned Friday in each of Connecticut’s five congressional districts, all in the service of defining himself as central to continuing a fiscal recovery brought to life on his watch.
“I think we’ve earned the right to actually do some bold initiatives. You know, eight years ago — $2 billion deficits, and everybody leaving the state. Then you had COVID, now you got Trump,” he said Thursday. “We’ve had a lot of stuff thrown at us over the last seven years, but we’ve also righted the ship, got our fiscal house in order.”
He begins the campaign with the advantages of wealth, incumbency and a home in a Democratic Party that dominates Connecticut politics, even if it struggles for a unifying message — or a consensus about a governor who scores well in the polls while frustrating progressives over his frugal habits.
“Yeah, the progressive wing in the legislature is obviously much more inclined to compromise on the guardrails and spend more than me or the general population,” he said. “I am in a position to point out that when I got here, state employees hadn’t gotten a raise in three years. They gotten seven in a row. The not-for-profits hadn’t seen a raise in three years. We’ve been able to keep up.”
Expect Lamont to self-fund his reelection and opt out of the state’s voluntary Citizens’ Election Program, which imposes spending limits in return for public financing: $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for the general election. Lamont spent $15.1 million on his 2018 campaign and $25.7 million on his 2022 reelection.
“I just find there’s so much outside money pouring in all these races,” Lamont said. “I’m not looking outspend anybody. I’m looking to compete, but I want to make sure I’m able to compete.”
Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, the two Republicans competing for the GOP nomination, are expected to seek public financing.
The run-up to the campaign has focused on promoting his record of the past seven years, most notably the state’s fiscal stability, as well as an early childhood trust fund that is perhaps his biggest deviation from a credo of avoiding major new expenses. The fund began with a deposit of $300 million and will bring down the costs of day care, raise salaries for providers and increase the number of available slots.
Lamont said a desire to see the fund thrive is one of the reasons he’s seeking a third term.
“I want to bring that to fruition. I don’t want that to get derailed,” he said.
On Thursday morning, he and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz announced the state was adding up to 1,000 new spaces in January. At the press conference, Lamont said, “People do a lot of promising in this business. I also like to deliver.”
But when asked later to say what about Lamont and his record would best inform voters about what to expect in a third term, he pointed to an attitude, not an accomplishment.
“I think optimism, making people believe in this state again,” he said. “You know, we were down on ourselves. Nobody believed in the state. And that’s infectious. I’d like to think optimism is infectious as well. I think you see that reflected in people believing in the state. More people wanting to be in the state, more businesses starting in the state. And if I could say the one thing I’m proudest of — it’s a little amorphous. I can tell you about balanced budgets — but I think people believe in the state. I think people say, ‘God, there’s a real reason for me to be here in Connecticut.’”
Lamont, 71, is the first Connecticut governor to seek a third term since Republican John G. Rowland in 2002 and the oldest to seek reelection since the 76-year-old Wilbur Cross, a Democrat, lost a bid for a fifth term in 1938, when gubernatorial terms were two years.
Lamont and Bysiewicz will begin their campaign in Bridgeport with a roundtable talk on workforce development, followed by a walking tour of downtown New Haven with Mayor Justin Elicker and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District. 
In Groton, they will talk about energy policy and fighting the White House over its suspension of an off-shore wind project. Then they go to Hartford for an event on rising healthcare costs, finishing the day with a campaign launch party at a brewery in Waterbury.
The campaign’s launch comes the day after a two-day special session of the General Assembly that addressed two sources of friction with some in his party: His unexpected veto in June of an omnibus housing bill and his defense of the so-called guardrails that direct a gusher of surplus dollars into a rainy day fund and an underfunded pension fund.
A revised version of the housing bill is headed to his desk, this time assured of his signature. And he agreed to at least temporarily relax the guardrails, diverting $500 million that had been bound for the pension fund into the budget reserve — a hedge against further federal shutdowns and cuts coming from President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
No one says the special session resolves all those tensions, and it’s not hard to find Democratic lawmakers who question whether he ever will use what essentially is a Trump contingency fund.
“We’re empowering the governor. We’re giving him the resources to respond to [Trump’s bill] and all of the artificial crises the federal government has created,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown. “What he chooses to do with those resources, I think we still have a lot of questions.”
In an interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Lamont acknowledged, “Look, I’m not racing to spend $500 million.”
But he noted his willingness to spend state dollars to maintain the availability of food and heating assistance when the shutdown interrupted federal funding of SNAP and WIC food assistance and LIHEAP heating aid.
“I was ready to step up and do SNAP and WIC and LIHEAP and all the things related to the shutdown. I was ready to do that because people were desperate and they needed some security that I was going to be there, even if Donald Trump was changing his mind every two days,” Lamont said. “I am more careful when people say, ‘Let’s use these one time funds for long term expenses.’ And that will probably be a debate.”
Those “long-term expenses” are references to the possible end of tax credits that subsidize health care premiums for policies purchased on the exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. In Connecticut alone, replacing those subsidies would be an annual cost of $350 million.
“I’ve tried to lead the conversation by saying I’m going to protect the most vulnerable,” Lamont said. “You can count upon that, and you and I may have a different definition, whether how big a commitment we’re making, but I think as a governor, that’s my obligation to make sure the most vulnerable are protected. That’s not just shut down, but that’s going forward.”
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, who counts himself among the Democrats who wish Lamont was more aggressive in his use of surplus funds, said any tensions that Democratic lawmakers have with Lamont speak well of the party and the governor.
“I think that tension is what makes us have to negotiate and put out a better product. So I would be upset if there were no tensions,” Winfield said.
It is a contrast, he said, to the congressional Republicans in Washington who are intimidated by the president.
Lamont said he shares the anger of his party’s liberals over Trump forcing spending cuts to the federal safety net to partly finance tax cuts for some of the nation’s highest earners. 
“If I was in Washington, D.C., I never would have given a tax cut to that Mar-a-Lago crowd and pay for it by cutting the hell out of health care, SNAP benefits,” he said. But he resists imposing higher taxes on the wealthy in Connecticut, saying it would make the state less competitive.
Lamont said he is sensitive to the vast inequality in wealth in Connecticut and the U.S.
“It’s exacerbated now, because the rich are getting richer, and the middle class is not keeping up. You have a debate in our party about that, which is ‘take from the rich and give to the poor,’ and it’s all a matter how you divvy up the pie,” Lamont said. “For me, I’m always emphasizing opportunity, chance to start your own business, chance to get a raise because you get more skills, chance to own your own home. Nothing builds wealth like owning your own home, cutting taxes for the middle class, not the big shot. So, two different ways of trying to go in the same direction.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_LamontPortrait_047-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

They examined the power of sheriffs’ offices as part of The New York Times’s Local Investigations Fellowship. This story was reported in collaboration with Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting.
For years, guards in a jail outside Jackson terrorized those in their care, according to dozens of people who say they endured, witnessed or participated in violent assaults.
Guards dragged inmates into blind corners, where cameras couldn’t capture acts of violence. They beat people behind closed doors. And they encouraged favored inmates to join in on the brutality.
Former inmates and guards said the violence at the Rankin County jail created a culture of fear and was widely accepted by officials as a way of keeping order, an investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times has found.
More than a dozen former inmates recounted being beaten for nonviolent infractions, like talking back to guards or getting caught with contraband. Many said a special group of inmates, known as trusties, helped guards beat troublemakers, lending fists whenever needed. Sometimes, the jail’s highest-ranking officials instigated the punishments or handed them down themselves, according to former guards and inmates.
The Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, which runs the jail, has a documented history of brazen violence. Last year, the Justice Department began investigating the agency for potential civil rights violations after Mississippi Today and The Times revealed that a group of detectives and patrol deputies, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” had been torturing suspected drug users for nearly 20 years.
This portrait of life inside the Rankin County jail is drawn from interviews with more than 70 former inmates. Many of their descriptions of widespread violence are supported by medical records and photographs, as well as incident reports written by guards and a video that shows guards shocking a man with an electrified vest.

Four former guards, three of whom asked to remain anonymous, also said they had witnessed unjustified beatings by other guards and trusties. Most described the violence as a weekly occurrence.
In a statement, the department’s attorney, Jason Dare, called the reporting “baseless.” The Rankin County jail, he wrote, “is one of the cleanest and best-run jails in Mississippi, with jailers never having been found to use excessive force in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”
After reviewing the findings, Sean Tindell, the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said on Wednesday that agents from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation had been assigned to investigate the allegations.
Since 2013, at least 11 inmates from the jail have sued the department, alleging they had been assaulted by guards or trusties. The vast majority represented themselves and most of the lawsuits were dismissed because of missed deadlines and court fees, or other technicalities.
The attacks, described in the lawsuits and in interviews with former guards and inmates, ranged in severity from slaps and whippings to brutal beatings that left inmates with bloody wounds and broken bones. Three guards and nearly two dozen former inmates said that trusties and guards would purposefully drag inmates into areas with no surveillance cameras before beating them.
Morgan Curtis, a former trusty who has been in and out of the jail since 2015, said the way guards would order trusties to attack inmates was “like a command to a pack of dogs.”
In interviews, nine former trusties, most of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation, admitted to helping guards beat inmates. They said the highest-ranking trusties were expected to back up guards during volatile situations or attack inmates so that guards would not have to do so themselves.
This group of trusties, recognizable by their blue jumpsuits, earned a nickname: the Blue Wave.
One former trusty described an incident from 2020. He said that on the orders of guards, he beat an inmate who had flooded his cell, kicking him repeatedly.
The following year, the jail’s top administrator, Barry Vaughn, confronted an inmate who had failed a drug test. Vaughn punched him so hard, the inmate said, that it broke his nose and knocked out two dental crowns.

Christian Dedmon, one of five former Rankin County deputies who was sentenced to federal prison for torturing two Black men in 2024, said that while he was working at the department he had watched Vaughn beat inmates in his office. A former guard described seeing several similar beatings. Vaughn declined to comment on the allegations.
In 2019, a man who briefly escaped the jail was lifted into the air by his throat and choked by a sheriff’s deputy, several inmates and a guard said. Bryan Bailey, the sheriff of the department, later bragged about the incident, according to Dedmon.
Dedmon has sent hundreds of emails from a federal prison in New Jersey, describing how his willingness to partake in violence helped him rise through the ranks. He has said that he wanted it known that the brutalities he committed were part of a deeply ingrained culture at the department.
He previously shared information about the use of taxpayer-funded equipment at Sheriff Bailey’s family farm, allegations that led to an investigation by the state auditor.
“They made me powerful and respected, made me actually feel like somebody, like I had done a good job,” Dedmon wrote. “It’s OK to beat drug addicts, it’s OK to take from the taxpayer, so why would I not mirror them?”
Beatings behind closed doors
The Rankin County Adult Detention Center is tucked behind the courthouse on the main drag of Brandon, a town of about 25,000 people with one of the lowest crime rates in the state.
Several hundred inmates, many of them accused of drug crimes and other nonviolent offenses, live in rows of beige cells stacked two stories high. Many have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting their day in court.
Over 10 months, reporters examined 69 alleged incidents of violence against inmates at the jail that occurred from 2012 to 2024.
They included 21 encounters in which guards documented that they had used force against inmates, and why, in incident reports. These reports are routinely filed whenever guards encounter issues. Their descriptions of violence differed greatly from what inmates said had happened.
But in a number of cases, reporters were able to interview eyewitnesses who supported the accounts of the victims. In several cases, medical records corroborated the injuries that inmates described.

In the case of Larry Buckhalter, the violence was filmed — by a guard.
In 2018, Buckhalter began a one-year sentence for possessing a small amount of cocaine. He was intellectually disabled, his family said, and people often took advantage of him.
According to three former guards who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Buckhalter was nicknamed “Crying Larry” by guards and other inmates because he had a habit of pestering jail staff with small requests.
One day, he asked for a Coca-Cola. A cellphone video obtained by Mississippi Today and The Times shows Buckhalter sitting quietly in a chair, strapped into a stun vest that is typically used to control violent inmates during court hearings.
Off camera, a man jokes that Buckhalter is going to bite off his tongue. A woman, who is also off camera, tells Buckhalter to give his consent.
Buckhalter takes a deep breath. “My name Larry and I volunteer to this,” he says.
The vest is activated. Buckhalter screams as his body convulses.
“Now you get a Coke,” the woman says. “It’s all over! I’m so proud of you, Larry!”
In his statement, Dare, the department attorney, did not address the guards’ actions. He criticized the reporting as “alleged rumors by unnamed sources who have no personal, first-hand knowledge of events,” and pointed out that reporters had not spoken to Buckhalter, who died in 2021.
Tindell, Mississippi’s public safety commissioner, called the video “appalling and utterly unacceptable.”
David Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that using force can be justified in certain circumstances, like if an inmate poses a threat; but doing so without cause or as punishment, he said, is “categorically inappropriate.” Corporal punishment in U.S. jails and prisons was deemed unconstitutional in the 1960s.
Fathi reviewed several incident reports filed by guards. He said the reasons they cited for using force were so vague they should have raised red flags to supervisors, and that the justifications fell far short of the typical threshold followed by jails and prisons.
In one such report, a guard wrote that he had struck an inmate, Dustin Rives, in the face because Rives had verbally threatened another guard. The blow broke Rives’ jaw, medical records show. Another report stated that guards struck Carvis Johnson and threw him to the floor in 2020 because he yelled threats and turned toward them after being ordered to face a wall.

For years, the man in charge of monitoring the jail was Vaughn, a captain who was recently promoted to undersheriff, making him second-in-command of the sheriff’s department.
According to a former deputy, a former guard and 14 former inmates, Vaughn often beat inmates who broke the rules, slapping and whipping them during interrogations in his office.
“ When you walked through his door, he had a shelf. And on the side of the shelf, he had like a wooden stick, a wooden baseball bat, two or three antennas,” said Cameron Kennedy, a former inmate who said Vaughn had questioned him on several occasions.
In June 2021, Vaughn called Kennedy and several other trusties who had failed drug tests into his office, one by one.
When Kennedy refused to explain where they had gotten the drugs, he said, Vaughn slapped him hard enough to give him a black eye.
Three of the other men who had failed drug tests said Vaughn had punched or whipped them with a car antenna. One of the men was Woodrow Lamont Lewis, the trusty who said Vaughn had knocked out his dental crowns that day. The men said they also saw other inmates return bloodied and bruised from Vaughn’s office.
A few months after the failed drug test, Kennedy was caught with a cellphone, an incident report shows. Vaughn handcuffed him to a chair and struck his shins and thighs with a car antenna, he said.
“He never did stop,” Kennedy said. “I’m talking about, like, 10 or 15 minutes, rapping me with it.”
Dedmon, the former deputy who is in prison, wrote in an email that he once saw Vaughn repeatedly punch an inmate who had smuggled drugs into the jail.
Vaughn directed reporters to speak with the department’s attorney, who denied the allegations.
Cigarettes and ‘free world’ chicken
Some of the country’s first trusty programs began in the early 1900s in Mississippi prisons.
Places like Parchman, a notorious prison in the Mississippi Delta, were known to select trusties from among their most violent inmates. The trusties, armed with guns and whips, were tasked with disciplining other inmates or forcing them to perform backbreaking work in cotton fields.
A federal court ruling in 1972 deemed trusty-on-prisoner violence unconstitutional, leading to the widespread dismantling of the programs in prisons across the nation.
Today, modern versions of trusty programs are common in county jails, though participants are generally banned from using physical force. These programs put nonviolent offenders to work, helping them learn job skills.
In Rankin County, many former trusties spoke glowingly about the program, crediting it with turning their lives around.
“It was the biggest blessing in my life,” said Cameron McKenzie, a former trusty. “I’ve been out now 20 months. I’m married, got full custody of both my kids, just bought a house, good job, you name it.”
Many inmates in the county jail are there only for short periods, while they await sentencing, but trusties usually serve their entire sentence in the facility, rising through the ranks over months or even years.
The most senior trusties — those who earn blue suits — have far better living conditions than other inmates. Former trusties said they slept in their own cellblock, in unlocked cells, and sometimes got passes to visit their families.
Many could roam the facility freely, play video games and work outside the jail. One former trusty, Cameron McCaskill, said he was allowed to keep a pet dog and order pizza.

“A blue suit is unrestricted,” Sheriff Bailey said during a 2020 interview with a Mississippi lobbying group. “Once they get a blue suit status, that is almost like being an employee here.”
Dare said trusties were not allowed to use force.
“ I do not believe that is specifically spelled out in a policy,” he said in an interview. “I do know it is a practice that trusties do not go hands-on.”
But several former guards and participants of the program said that the jail staff expected some trusties to provide extra muscle in exchange for their privileges.
“ If something is going on with the officer and they need assistance, you need to be there,” said Lewis, the former trusty. “If you ain’t there to help them, whether they are winning or losing, then you already know you’re next.”
Three others said trusties were rewarded, sometimes with “free world” food, for joining the violence.
“People would do just about anything for a cigarette, or a box of Church’s chicken with a honey biscuit,” said Phillip Smith, a former trusty. “That was the motivation of the Blue Wave.”
Dozens of former inmates, including many who participated in the program, said they had witnessed trusties hitting or kicking other inmates, or holding them down while guards beat them.
Of the 11 inmates who have sued the sheriff’s department since 2013, five said in their lawsuits that trusties attacked them with guards. All but one had their lawsuits dismissed.
Carvis Johnson, an inmate who had a long history of disciplinary infractions, claimed in a 2020 lawsuit that he had been beaten by guards and trusties. Court records show that Mr. Johnson settled his lawsuit, but the department declined to provide further details about the settlement.
Incident reports show that a confrontation began after Mr. Johnson shoved feces under his cell door and broke a sprinkler, flooding his cell. Trusties were brought in to clean up the mess. Guards led Mr. Johnson out of his cell and knocked him to the floor after he verbally threatened them, the reports show.
In an interview, Brock Reed, a former trusty, said a guard told a group of trusties to give Johnson “a sample” and that they should beat him because they would be the ones stuck cleaning up his mess.
Reed said the guards led Johnson to a corner widely known for being a camera blind spot. A supervisor’s routine review of the incident confirmed there was no security camera footage of what happened, in part because “hallway camera does not show where inmate was in the hall.”
When Johnson hit the floor, Reed kicked him in the hip and lower back, he said.
“I wasn’t going to be the one trusty to tell the police, ‘No, I’m not doing this,’” he said. “I know how they look at you for that.”

Christopher Mack, a former inmate, sued the department last year, claiming trusties and guards beat him in 2021. When he made bail and left the jail with twin black eyes the next day, Mack said, Sheriff Bailey approached him and asked who had caused his injuries.
“ I looked at him and said, ‘Mr. Bailey, you know who did this to me, your officers and trusties did this to me,’” Mack said.
The sheriff cursed under his breath, Mack said, and stormed off.
A battered escapee and a bragging sheriff
In September 2019, William Keith Richards found out what could happen to trusties who took advantage of their freedom.
Richards, a blue-suit, had nearly completed his sentence when he walked out of the jail one Friday. Officials did not notice he was gone until he missed church that Sunday, an incident report shows.
When Richards was caught, other blue-suit trusties were ordered to gather at a garage entrance of the jail, where Bailey berated them for not informing guards of the escape, four former trusties said in interviews.
Bailey told the trusties they should take a good look at Richards, because he was the reason they were about to lose their special privileges, two of them said.
Richards was escorted back to the jail by Deputy Wes Shivers, a 6-foot-8 former U.F.C. fighter. After they arrived, Shivers lifted the inmate into the air by his throat and choked him, said two former trusties and a former guard. In an interview, Shivers confirmed that he had returned Richards to the jail but denied choking him.

It is unclear whether Bailey saw the incident or when he left the room. Shivers said he could not recall whether the sheriff was nearby when he arrived with Richards.
A group of guards and trusties dragged Richards into the jail’s dressing room, which was known to not have cameras, and beat him, according to four former inmates familiar with the incident.
They saw Richards in the days following, and said his face was swollen and his neck was ringed with bruises.
“They did a number on him,” Reed said.
Richards declined to comment for this article, citing fears for his safety. Bailey declined a request to comment, deferring to the department’s attorney. In a statement, Dare, who called the reporting “baseless,” did not address whether Bailey was present during the incident.
The department did not produce reports detailing Richards’s capture despite repeated requests.
During email exchanges with reporters, Dedmon recounted the sheriff bragging to him and others about how Shivers had choked an inmate who had escaped.
“Bailey used to talk about it,” Dedmon wrote. “I can just remember Bailey saying, ‘Wes held him up against the wall with one hand.’”
A ‘satisfactory response’
Mississippi Today and The Times obtained formal grievance documents from lawyers who sued the department, providing a rare window into how jail officials handled inmate complaints. From 2018 to 2022, eight inmates filed grievances that described assaults by guards or trusties.
In 2022, Rives, the inmate whose jaw was broken by a guard, filed a grievance. Jail incident reports show that after Rives was struck, guards strapped him into a restraint chair overnight and then locked him in an isolation cell for 25 days. It was there where he filed his grievance, saying he had not been taken to the hospital. His jaw was infected by the time he was hospitalized and required surgery, according to medical records.
“ It never healed,” he said. “ If I take a bite out of a hamburger, it’ll lock up and pop and grind like you wouldn’t believe.”

A report from Rives’s grievance file shows that a supervisor closed his complaint three days after it had been filed, saying the department had documented the incident and provided a “satisfactory response,” which included scheduling a hospital visit for Rives and informing him that he could not press criminal charges against the guard while incarcerated.
Rives said the department did not contact him again.
The report does not indicate whether the guard who broke Rives’s jaw, Jordan McQueary, was disciplined or questioned about the incident. Rives is among at least nine inmates who have filed complaints or federal lawsuits claiming they were assaulted by McQueary, who still works at the department.
Last year, the department honored McQueary for his “outstanding” work.
He did not respond to requests for comment.
At least six other grievances were closed under similar circumstances, with no indication that the guards or trusties accused of violence were interviewed or disciplined.
Supervisors also listed “satisfactory response” as the reason for closing three other complaints. The forms do not define the term, and department representatives did not respond to requests for clarification.
Defending the trusty program
Two former trusties who spoke to Mississippi Today and The Times about their experiences said they have since been confronted by jail officials about their interviews.
John Phillips, a former trusty who said he witnessed and participated in violence between 2017 and 2021, was brought back to the Rankin County jail in August to face new criminal charges.
While there, he was taken to Vaughn’s office, where Vaughn and Dare questioned him about what he had told the publications.
Phillips then wrote and signed a statement contradicting the comments he had made to reporters. His lawyer was not present during the meeting, Phillips and Dare said.
“I never seen anything that the news reporters are talking about when spoken about inmates on inmates or the Blue Wave,” the statement reads, according to a copy provided by Dare. “There is no wrong doing at the Rankin jail or in the program.”
In a later interview, Phillips stressed that his statements to reporters had been true, and that he had felt pressured by the officials to write the letter. Dare said he had not pressured Phillips. He provided a recording of a portion of the August interaction in which Phillips says he is giving his statement voluntarily.
Dare said that he had collected similar statements from several other former trusties, but he declined to share their names.
“I sit down and try to meet with folks, figure out what they know,” he said in an interview last month. “I’m trying to defend the trusty program, that’s all.”

Insurance rates are expected to increase by double-digit percentages as tax credits on Affordable Care Act premiums are set to expire at the end of the year.
The tax credits had been a sticking point in the shutdown fight, but the deal reached this week did not extend the credits.
Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act began Nov. 1.
The lack of action on health insurance seems to open the door for changes experts and advocates have been fearing for months, a new health care landscape that includes increased insurance costs and much less governmental support for individuals who may not qualify for Medicaid, but still need help to afford health coverage.
“As Ohioans begin to consider coverage for 2026, they can expect to pay substantially more for their premiums on the federal marketplace,” the Health Policy Institute of Ohio said in a policy brief released this month.
An analysis by health research nonprofit KFF showed that since the introduction of the enhanced premium tax credits, enrollment in marketplace plans has “more than doubled” to more than 24 million people nationally.
Without the tax credits, KFF said annual premium payments in 2024 would have been more than 75% higher than they were.
“Enrollees with incomes about 400% of the (federal poverty line) will be subject to large increases in premium payments if enhanced premium tax credits expire,” according to KFF research.

With an annual premium increase of 18%, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see annual premiums rise by an average of more than $22,000 in 2026, the KFF found.
The Health Policy Institute of Ohio said that states that run their own health marketplace expect to see premium increases of 17%, but individuals in states like Ohio, who use the federal marketplace directly, should expect to see an average jump of 30%.
The institute said the rates are the largest changes requested by insurers since 2018.
“Because those previously enrolled in marketplace coverage will likely be ineligible for Medicaid coverage because of their income level and usually do not have insurance coverage offered through their job, most will likely become uninsured,” the policy brief stated.

A recent study by the Urban Institute estimated an additional 140,000 Ohioans could be uninsured because of the tax credit expiration, pushing the uninsured rate in the state up 29%.
Those who stick with the Affordable Care Act would could see thousands of dollars in increases without the tax credits.
A 27-year-old Ohioan with a $35,000 annual income could see their premiums jump from $1,033 to $2,615.
A 35-year-old couple who makes $30,000 per year would go from paying nothing with the credit, to paying more than $1,100, according to the institute analysis, citing KFF data.
The insurance cost increases are attributed not only to a fear that with increased premiums, younger Americans will drop coverage, but also to rising hospital costs, bigger demand for “expensive pharmaceuticals” and “economic forces such as potential tariffs on medical supplies, inflation and labor shortages.”
Medicaid has already seen its share of cuts, including a ban on funding directed toward Planned Parenthood health clinics.
The cuts have caused Ohio-area affiliates to reduce staff in clinics that provide preventive care along with reproductive health access.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has even closed facilities due to the loss of Medicaid patients, which make up about 40% of their client population.
The changes to the Affordable Care Act credits would come despite vast public support for the renewal of the tax credits.

The word “emergency” sticks in our minds because that is what the Trump administration claimed last Friday when it urgently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). As Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media, the administration filed an “emergency stay application in the Supreme Court requesting immediate relief.”
Immediate relief from what? As winter was approaching and 42 million Americans in poverty were facing their first full month without food assistance, the “emergency” facing the administration was simple: a U.S. District Court’s ruling requiring it to fund SNAP benefits, consistent with an another court order the week before. The district court judge had told the administration it was “simply unacceptable” to wait any longer to fund the program “for political reasons.” He added, “Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry. This should never happen in America.”
It happened in America, the richest and most powerful nation on earth.
Even as the government reopens this week after the record-long shutdown, tens of millions of Americans — including family and friends of ours — have already experienced substantial harm due to the administration’s actions. Roughly 1 out of every 8 Americans did not receive food assistance as scheduled at the beginning of November, including some 76,000 Granite Staters. More than 41% of them are children. Many work in low-wage jobs or at home caring for children or elderly relatives. Many are veterans, homeless, living with disabilities, and no longer exempted from work requirements. Although countless nonprofits like the New Hampshire Food Bank and churches like our own are doing their level best to meet the need, they simply can’t keep up.
The question was never if the administration could fund SNAP in the midst of the government shutdown. By its own admission, executive agencies like the Department of Agriculture which administers SNAP had access to tens of billions of dollars in leftover funds, which the courts had ordered it to use to stave off widespread hunger. In fact, the administration had effectively reworked other parts of the federal budget to sustain top priorities during the shutdown like paying ICE officers to continue mass deportations, which government data show primarily target people without any criminal record.
In “emergency” times like these, people of faith like our family often turn to scripture with a greater sense of urgency. The president and many of his top officials tell us they are Christian. In fact, his recent threat to launch a “vicious” military attack on Nigeria over targeted persecution of Christians (a claim strongly rejected by Nigeria’s democratic government) appears calculated to burnish his image with conservative evangelicals.
It was the latest in a series of actions toward the African continent — including restricting refugees in favor of white Afrikaners who perpetrated apartheid in Sindiso’s native South Africa — which violate Christian notions of humanity or the African philosophy of ubuntu. Such actions, from blocking food aid for hungry Americans to threatening war against African nations that pose no threat to the United States, are the definition of inhumaneness and the opposite of Jesus’ life and teaching.
As we try, and often fail, to show our kids, following Jesus begins with loving God and other people, especially those who are hungry and in need. In fact, shortly before sacrificing his life out of love for us, Jesus taught his disciples that to follow him we must serve the poor, the foreigner, the sick, and the imprisoned.
“For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.” When the righteous people in Jesus’ parable ask, “Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?” Jesus answers simply, “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” (Matthew 25:31-46 NIV)
Whatever your faith, or lack thereof, we as Americans can all agree that no child should go hungry. If only our leaders saw the true emergency and responded humanely.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/foodassist-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

(Getty Images.)An Ohio Senate measure updating the state’s orphan well program is getting pushback from environmentalists, counties, and farmers.
The proposal, Ohio Senate Bill 219, aims to balance money for plugging up old wells with provisions making it easier to drill new ones.
Critics argue that the balance is off — giving drillers new perks without doing enough to promote the orphan well program.
“While S.B. 219 appears to elevate and improve laws governing oil and gas operations in Ohio,” Southeast Ohio resident Roxanne Groff testified Wednesday, “the bill does just the opposite.”
But those critiques don’t appear to be landing with the bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Al Landis, R-Dover, or committee chairman, state Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta.
“This whole thing has been misconstrued,” Chavez said after the hearing. “People are looking for the bad in it, and there’s no nefarious piece of this.”
The environmental critiques
The bill aims to secure funding for plugging orphan wells by creating new fund with strict limits on how and when money can be transferred out.
In particular, the bill prohibits state officials from moving dollars from the orphan well fund to the general revenue fund.
Although Groff agreed that funding “should not be ‘raided’ to make up budget deficits,” she worried the bill could tie the hands of the person heading up the oil and gas division.
“Interest funds can only be dispersed by the director, with the advice of the Technical Advisory Committee for Oil and Gas,” Groff noted.
Six members of that eight-member panel come from oil and gas companies.
Groff noted the governor vetoed a similar provision in last summer’s budget.
“I can only hope that he vetoes this bill also,” she said.
Groff called another provision “excessive” which allows drillers to demand expedited review of their applications 10 times in a calendar year.
As recently as 2022, she said, agency officials wrote new rules to increase public participation for injection wells used to dispose of drilling waste.
“This bill would seem to eliminate that if a company requested an expedited permit,” Gross said.
Ohio state senator proposes dedicated well-plugging fund, other regulatory changes

In an earlier hearing, Cathy Cowan Becker from Save Ohio Parks noted the bill shortens the timeline for reviewing nominations and bids to frack beneath state land.
Instead of 180 days to review a nomination the commission has 90.
Rather than putting the parcel out for bid the following quarter, the commission would have to post it immediately and choose a winner in 60 days.
After that, state officials would have just 30 days to complete lease.
Becker said that turnaround is “unreasonably short.”
“The people have 45 days to submit comments about fracking nominations,” she said, “However, we are often not informed of such nominations until days, even weeks, after they have been received.”
County and farmer pushback
Meanwhile, the County Commissioners Association of Ohio and the Ohio Farm Bureau had pushed lawmakers to remove a provision making road-use agreements voluntary.
The commissioners association explained that local governments maintain 83% of Ohio’s road miles.
“These local roads are not designed for the constant movement of heavy industrial traffic associated with horizontal drilling operations — vehicles hauling water, sand, equipment, and production waste,” the group testified.
“Even limited activity of this nature can cause substantial degradation of rural roads.”
Evan Callicoat from the Ohio Farm Bureau on Wednesday thanked lawmakers for restoring road use agreements in the latest version of the bill. But he raised two other quibbles as well.
The measure reduces the statute of limitations for terminating an oil and gas lease.
The current 21-year statute of limitations gives homeowners a significant stretch of time to claim a lease has expired due to lack of production.
The bill would reduce that term to three years which the Farm Bureau opposes.
Another provision tweaks a driller’s responsibilities when dealing with several landowners ‘unitized’ into one drilling lease.
Callicoat said it looks like lawmakers want to ensure agreements with individual landowners can’t violate an order from state regulators, “which we totally understand and support.”
But as written, he worries it would allow drillers to disregard agreements so long as they comply with regulatory orders.
“If a well owner agrees to certain terms with specific landowners in a given pool, they should be required to follow those provisions,” Callicoat said.
‘Misnomers and misinformation’
Speaking after the hearing, Chavez and Landis defended the legislation and noted some of the changes were recommendations from the chief of the state’s division of oil and gas.
Chavez explained that previously companies could ask for an unlimited number of expedited permits, “and there were some companies that were abusing that system.”
“(That) clogs it up,” Landis chimed in.
To avoid the logjam, Chavez went on, the division stopped offering any expedited permits.
To him, 10 expedited permits a year feels like a reasonable compromise.
“But it doesn’t circumvent — and that was a misnomer in the testimony there — it doesn’t circumvent anything in the process. It just says it goes to the front of the line,” he said. “It still has to comply with everything in that permitting process and approval process.”
“There’s a lot of misnomers and misinformation on the testimonies,” Chavez claimed. “And our job is not to correct them up here — we’re to listen.”
What they’re hearing is making some difference, at least at the margins.
An amendment adopted Wednesday gives priority to plugging orphan wells near injection wells.
Are those wells more dangerous or less stable?
“In my opinion, no,” Chavez said, but some stakeholders had expressed that concern.
Orphan wells are often old and relatively shallow, he said, while injection wells are relatively deep.
“There’s multiple layers of separation,” he said. “But you know, if there are concerns, we’re just saying, hey, add that to your priority list. Instead of plugging wells out in the middle of the woods, let’s make sure we plug around here to allay any fears that there may be.”

When news happens, which it does all day every day, they gird themselves to report and write a story. If they finish an in-depth project or especially artful investigation, they are allowed to luxuriate in their achievement for a few minutes before an editor inquires: “What do you have for me today?”
I’m not asking for anyone’s pity. Journalists either enjoy or grudgingly accept this reality, depending on temperament. But it’s also why the induction of Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter into the Kansas Press Association’s Newspaper Hall of Fame on Thursday was so deeply jarring. You see, I don’t think of Tim as a Hall of Famer. I don’t think of him as a portrait on a wall alongside other Kansas journalism greats like William Allen White, Rolla Clymer, and four generations of Scotts and Lynns at The Iola Register.
I think of Tim as a damn fine reporter who’s going to uncover something today. And tomorrow, if we’re lucky. He’s rock solid. He’s tenacious.
And he never stops writing stories.
Tim lives and works in the present. I don’t want to think of him as a relic of the past. Just this week, the same week that he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, Tim has written five stories. He covered the response of Kansas senators and representatives in Washington, D.C., to the end of the longest shutdown on record. He followed up on fallout from former Beneficient CEO Brad Heppner’s indictment. Just to top things off, he covered multiple sets of findings  from state auditors.

@ksreflectorKansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter was inducted into the Kansas Newspaper Hall of Fame on Nov. 13, 2025. His 40-year career has been spent fighting corruption, holding politicians accountable and being dedicated to the finest principles of journalism. #Kansas #firstamendment♬ original sound – Kansas Reflector


This is not a man who rests on his laurels. This is a man who doesn’t know what laurels are.
Let’s talk numbers for a second. This column counts as my 484th piece since beginning at the Reflector in August 2021. That sounds impressive enough, and I occasionally share my tally to impress others. But Tim, who has been present since the Reflector’s founding in July 2020, has written an astonishing 2,248 stories.
All of this has only been the latest act of a distinguished career. Here’s where the history comes in, the looking back, which I’m sure makes him feel a bit uncomfortable. Tim attended Kansas State  University, then worked at United Press International. He followed up with stints at the Lawrence Journal-World and The Topeka Capital-Journal, where Reflector editor Sherman Smith and I both came to know him.
What’s Tim Carpenter like? He’s just “Carp,” to use the nickname that so many have employed over the years.
He’s the kind of dedicated professional you would hope. He carries a healthy skepticism of editors, no doubt forged from decades of battling them to protect his reporting. He has a dry sense of humor, a library of extraordinary anecdotes (seriously, ask him about the voodoo priestess) and an uneasy relationship with technology that hasn’t prevented him from prolifically posting TikTok videos.
Most of all, though, Tim cares.
He cares about the art and craft of journalism. He cares about his family. He cares about the state of Kansas.
While I have known many gifted writers and reporters, none have matched Tim’s ferocious caring. When Sherman Smith takes an all-too-rare vacation from his duties as editor, I fill in as best I can. When I call Tim to ask what he’s working on, I know he will share an array of potential stories with an excitement and energy that puts colleagues 40 years his junior to shame. Sorry, kids, that’s just the truth,
As he said to the crowd gathered in Topeka: “Almost everything that I treasure in life came from journalism. My family, a career, a path. When I looked at the people in the hall of fame, I saw a bunch of names I recognized. I worked with, competed against, learned from about two dozen of those people, and I’m just really honored to be part of the group.”
Over my career, I’ve come to recognize that a precious few people are born to be journalists. They are born to be reporters. They are born to do this work.
Tim Carpenter is one of those people.
Kansas is lucky to have him. Kansas Reflector readers are lucky to have him. Congratulations to the Kansas Newspaper Hall of Fame’s latest, most deserving member.

“Time flies,” “time waits for no one,” “as time goes on”: The way we speak about time tends to strongly imply that the passage of time is some sort of real process that happens out there in the world. We inhabit the present moment and move through time, even as events come and go, fading into the past.
But go ahead and try to actually verbalize just what is meant by the flow or passage of time. A flow of what? Rivers flow because water is in motion. What does it mean to say that time flows?
Events are more like happenings than things, yet we talk as though they have ever-changing locations in the future, present or past. But if some events are future, and moving toward you, and some past, moving away, then where are they? The future and past don’t seem to have any physical location.
Human beings have been thinking about time for as long as we have records of humans thinking about anything at all. The concept of time inescapably permeates every single thought you have about yourself and the world around you. That’s why, as a philosopher, philosophical and scientific developments in our understanding of time have always seemed especially important to me.
 Ancient philosophers on time


Ancient philosophers were very suspicious about the whole idea of time and change. Parmenides of Elea was a Greek philosopher of the sixth to fifth centuries BCE. Parmenides wondered, if the future is not yet and the past is not anymore, how could events pass from future to present to past?
He reasoned that, if the future is real, then it is real now; and, if what is real now is only what is present, the future is not real. So, if the future is not real, then the occurrence of any present event is a case of something inexplicably coming from nothing.
Parmenides wasn’t the only skeptic about time. Similar reasoning regarding contradictions inherent in the way we talk about time appears in Aristotle, in the ancient Hindu school known as the Advaita Vedanta and in the work of Augustine of Hippo, also known as St. Augustine, just to name a few.
 Einstein and relativity

The early modern physicist Isaac Newton had presumed an unperceived yet real flow of time. To Newton, time is a dynamic physical phenomenon that exists in the background, a regular, ticking universe-clock in terms of which one can objectively describe all motions and accelerations.
Then, Albert Einstein came along.
In 1905 and 1915, Einstein proposed his special and general theories of relativity, respectively. These theories validated all those long-running suspicions about the very concept of time and change.
Relativity rejects Newton’s notion about time as a universal physical phenomenon.
By Einstein’s era, researchers had shown that the speed of light is a constant, regardless of the velocity of the source. To take this fact seriously, he argued, is to take all object velocities to be relative.
Nothing is ever really at rest or really in motion; it all depends on your “frame of reference.” A frame of reference determines the spatial and temporal coordinates a given observer will assign to objects and events, on the assumption that he or she is at rest relative to everything else.
Someone floating in space sees a spaceship going by to the right. But the universe itself is completely neutral on whether the observer is at rest and the ship is moving to the right, or if the ship is at rest with the observer moving to the left.
This notion affects our understanding of what clocks actually do. Because the speed of light is a constant, two observers moving relative to each other will assign different times to different events.
In a famous example, two equidistant lightning strikes occur simultaneously for an observer at a train station who can see both at once. An observer on the train, moving toward one lightning strike and away from the other, will assign different times to the strikes. This is because one observer is moving away from the light coming from one strike and toward the light coming from the other. The other observer is stationary relative to the lightning strikes, so the respective light from each reaches him at the same time. Neither is right or wrong.
How much time elapses between events, and what time something happens, depends on the observer’s frame of reference. Observers moving relative to each other will, at any given moment, disagree on what events are happening now; events that are happening now according to one observer’s reckoning at any given moment will lie in the future for another observer, and so on.
Under relativity, all times are equally real. Everything that has ever happened or ever will happen is happening now for a hypothetical observer. There are no events that are either merely potential or a mere memory. There is no single, absolute, universal present, and thus there is no flow of time as events supposedly “become” present.
Change just means that the situation is different at different times. At any moment, I remember certain things. At later moments, I remember more. That’s all there is to the passage of time. This doctrine, widely accepted today among both physicists and philosophers, is known as “eternalism”.
This brings us to a pivotal question: If there is no such thing as the passage of time, why does everyone seem to think that there is?
 Time as a psychological projection

One common option has been to suggest that the passage of time is an “illusion” – exactly as Einstein famously described it at one point.
Calling the passage of time “illusory” misleadingly suggests that our belief in the passage of time is a result of misperception, as though it were some sort of optical illusion. But I think it’s more accurate to think of this belief as resulting from misconception.
As I propose in my book “A Brief History of the Philosophy of Time,” our sense of the passage of time is an example of psychological projection – a type of cognitive error that involves misconceiving the nature of your own experience.
The classic example is color. A red rose is not really red, per se. Rather, the rose reflects light at a certain wavelength, and a visual experience of this wavelength may give rise to a feeling of redness. My point is that the rose is neither really red nor does it convey the illusion of redness.
The red visual experience is just a matter of how we process objectively true facts about the rose. It’s not a mistake to identify a rose by its redness; the rose enthusiast isn’t making a deep claim about the nature of color itself.
Similarly, my research suggests that the passage of time is neither real nor an illusion: It’s a projection based on how people make sense of the world. I can’t really describe the world without the passage of time any more than I can describe my visual experience of the world without referencing the color of objects.
I can say that my GPS “thinks” I took a wrong turn without really committing myself to my GPS being a conscious, thinking being. My GPS has no mind, and thus no mental map of the world, yet I am not wrong in understanding its output as a valid representation of my location and my destination.
Similarly, even though physics leaves no room for the dynamic passage of time, time is effectively dynamic to me as far as my experience of the world is concerned.
The passage of time is inextricably bound up with how humans represent our own experiences. Our picture of the world is inseparable from the conditions under which we, as perceivers and thinkers, experience and understand the world. Any description of reality we come up with will unavoidably be infused with our perspective. The error lies in confusing our perspective on reality with reality itself.

Adrian Smith and Mike Flood at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sep. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)This year, Congress enacted a law that allows American taxpayers in participating states to take up to $1,700 a year in federal tax credits for donating to organizations providing scholarships for students to attend private and religious K-12 schools.
Before Nebraska taxpayers would be allowed to claim this federal tax credit, the federal law required that governors approve of state participation, and Nebraska’s did. Gov. Jim Pillen’s decision to do so has resulted in some criticism.
However, the critics missed something vital.
In my opinion, most Nebraskans would rather keep their federal tax dollars in Nebraska, where they could help employ Nebraska private school teachers and administrators and provide income to businesses that sell equipment and services to schools.
Some, including Nebraska Examiner columnist George Ayoub, argue that last November’s vote against a state-funded school voucher law means that a majority of Nebraskans oppose state taxpayers taking advantage of this new federal tax credit.
But the fact that a majority of Nebraskans voted against state-funded scholarships for K-12 students says nothing about how they feel about the federal tax credit program, which involves no expenditures from state income, sales or property taxes.
Under the federal tax credit program, Nebraskans who owe federal income taxes can either send $1,700 to the federal government, or they can donate that $1,700 to a qualified scholarship granting organization right here in Nebraska.
That money flowing to private schools will also flow through to the employees and businesses that help the schools do their work, people who pay Nebraska state income taxes, and they will increase Nebraska tax revenues.
As those employees and businesses spend that money on food, housing, healthcare and so forth, it will generate more economic activity and more sales and income tax revenue that can then be used to support public K-12 schools.
In addition, every K-12 student in a private school is one less student whose education must be provided at the expense of payers of Nebraska property, income and sales taxes, thus saving Nebraska taxpayers money.
Federal tax dollars are already used to provide scholarships to college students at private and religious schools, including Pell grants. So it is difficult to understand the objection to using what would otherwise become federal tax dollars to provide scholarships for K-12 students at private and religious schools.
Perhaps opponents of the governor’s decision to allow Nebraskans to benefit from the federal tax credit could bring an initiative petition to overturn Pillen’s decision.
If so, the question for Nebraskans will be, “Do you want to send more tax dollars to Washington or keep those tax dollars here in Nebraska, where they will strengthen our economy, increase state tax revenues and further support K-12 public schools?”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1096-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-14 04:58:01.515352
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-14 06:21:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Housing bill gets final approval from CT Senate in special session,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/14/ct-senate-final-approval-housing-bill/,Housing has long been a politically charged issue in Connecticut and one of the issues that most divides Republicans and Democrats.,"Even as the Senate gave final passage to a new version of a wide-ranging housing bill Friday, political tensions simmered in Hartford over the two-day special session.
The Senate approved the measure early Friday morning on a 24-10 vote. All four Democrats who voted against a former version switched their votes, and no Republicans voted for the bill. The measure, which the House of Representatives approved on Wednesday, next heads to Lamont’s desk. The governor is expected to sign it.
Housing has long been a politically charged issue in Connecticut and one of the issues that most divides Republicans and Democrats.
Lamont’s veto of House Bill 5002, a sweeping housing bill passed by Democrats during the regular session, damaged his relationship with many lawmakers from his own party. The governor said he wanted to get towns on board, and called for a special session to pass a negotiated version of the bill.
While some said they’re glad to see the finished compromise bill and thankful that the governor stuck with negotiations, for other senators, that relationship remains strained.
House Bill 8002 requires towns to create housing growth plans, changes minimum off-street parking requirements, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to take steps to allow more housing, among other measures.
“We’re on the verge of passing a major housing bill that will impact the lives of the people of Connecticut in a very positive way,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, noting that other states have passed major housing reform legislation over the past few years. “Our goal is to join with them, understanding this crisis and the nature of this crisis and working to be more proactive and not just reactive.”
Lamont has touted the new housing bill as a compromise. His administration has also put millions in bonding money into building more housing. Lamont pointed to the mayors who ultimately endorsed the revised bill.
“I think we got a pretty good balance. Like I said, ‘Towns take the lead, give these mayors the incentives.’ They stood up, Republicans and Democrats said, ‘We have the incentives we need.’”
But Republicans in the House and Senate objected to both the content of the housing bill and the process — running it in special session, with less time for debate and outside of the normal political process. The bill produced moments of heated debate between the parties over the last two days.
In the House, one Republican was chastised over what Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said were personal attacks.
While the rest of the bill saw little or no changes, many of the most substantive pieces around zoning were changed in the compromised version, particularly the portions that drew objections from local leaders. Members of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns spoke at a press conference last week in support of the new bill.
The bill requires that towns, either by themselves or with their regional councils of government, create housing growth plans that include a number of units set as a goal to plan and zone for. 
By complying with this section of the law, towns have access to new state money and get increased reimbursement rates for school construction projects. They can also access those benefits by following certain parameters to increase housing density near public transit or by joining the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority to allow more housing in downtowns and near transit.
It also includes parameters to allow conversion of commercial properties to residential without special hearings before planning and zoning commissions, although towns can require that the first floor stay commercial.
It eliminates minimum off-street parking requirements for new apartments of up to 16 units, although towns can require parking assessments and additional parking in two zones of the town not amounting to more than 8% of the land.
And it establishes the Department of Housing as a housing authority that can develop affordable housing on state land and work with towns to build. 
Debate began Thursday evening and ended early Friday morning.
“The bottom line is we have a moral obligation to create more housing,” said Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester. “We have a moral obligation to bring people inside from cold weather.”
Republicans criticized the use of a special session as well as the contents of the bill, saying it dilutes local control.
“I truly believe that this is going to be a bill that we look back upon as a monumental step in the implementation of statewide zoning efforts,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said housing is such an important issue as a matter of statewide policy “that it has to be regarded as something that, in many cases, would vault above and supersede local authority.”
Housing Committee ranking member Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, questioned whether the state actually has a lack of affordable housing. Numerous studies have shown the state has an acute shortage of housing units.
“Is there something you can show me that says that we actually have a substantial shortage of housing?” Sampson asked Duff during debate. Sampson said he had found over 2,000 rental units available online.
“We’re just going to disagree, and that’s OK. You can keep asking me the same question and I’ll give you the same answer,” Duff replied, and pointed to a study released by an outside consultant earlier this year that showed that Connecticut had the most constrained housing market in the nation.
Duff said he thinks the bill will help get more housing built in the state.
Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London, said in an interview that she worries that the new bill doesn’t have the “urgency” that the old bill did. She liked that it gave towns numbers, a goal to work for, and fears that delays before housing growth plans are due will leave Connecticut residents suffering.
“The fact that we’re waiting years now to get these housing growth plans, that worries me,” Marx said. “I just want affordable housing to be built. I want people to have roofs over their heads.”
She added that she doesn’t think the bill has repaired her relationship with Lamont.
“I still haven’t quite gotten over the fact that the governor vetoed it,” she said.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, said after the housing veto and discussions over spending in the wake of federal cuts, he wonders whether Lamont “is even in touch with the reality of what the people in the state of Connecticut are experiencing.
“I think the number of people who are experiencing unhoused status and homelessness is increasing in our state. For a state which is one of the richest per capita in the United States and also of the richest country in the world, to allow that to happen and not have an intervention, and despite multiple advocates, community members, reaching out to the governor, and his unwillingness to address this in a meaningful manner is painful to me,” Anwar said Thursday, of the veto.
The governor did not directly answer when asked if the passage of the housing bill would ease tensions with the lawmakers who were furious at his unexpected veto.
“I think we have a pretty good working relationship, I really do,” he said. “[Chief of staff Matthew] Brokman helps by the way. Everybody knows him, trusts him.”
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement that “the status quo is unsustainable and no solution is possible without local leaders stepping up.” Lamont has met over the past several months with municipal leaders, bipartisan lawmakers and nonprofits to “craft a plan that gives communities the tools to build housing on their own terms,” Blanchard added.
“While some lawmakers would rather legislate in the press or put more energy into floor theatrics than actual solutions, the Governor is grateful to those who showed up ready to work,” Blanchard said. “By strengthening this bill, he’s listening to residents who want lower rents, families who need a home they can afford, and businesses need to house their employees.”
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said while there may be frustrations at the governor about the veto, that tension is healthy. He pointed to the federal government, where legislative Republicans are broadly in lock-step with the president.
“The legislature is trying to express the will of the people as they see it, and the governor is doing what he sees as the right thing,” Winfield said. “And that tension brings us to a place where, if we get it right, and I’m not always saying we do, but if we get it right, we got it right because of the tension.”
Duff said he was focused on the end result.
“There’s always going to be tensions between legislative and executive to get something done, but we’re getting it done today, and I think that’s the most important thing, the end product,” Duff said.
The 2026 gubernatorial election has also cast a shadow over the housing bill debate. While Lamont said he vetoed the original bill because he wanted to get towns and cities on board, his emails and text messages show the two-term governor got advice about the political implications of signing a bill that many opposed.
Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, who has already announced his campaign for governor, said the new housing bill doesn’t address problems with 8-30g, a decades-old state housing law that offers developers court remedies when their affordable housing proposals are denied. He also criticized the process of passing the bill and said there might have been portions he could support if there had been more time for debate.
“Regardless of the merits, this is no way to lead a state government. There is no justification for it,” said Fazio.
Housing, and particularly 8-30g, was a major issue during the last gubernatorial campaign, and has been ranked by Connecticut residents in a recent poll as one of the most important issues facing the state.
During Wednesday’s House debate on the bill, Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, was reprimanded by Ritter for what Ritter said were personal comments about other lawmakers.
“I don’t know how somebody could put their head on the pillow at the end of the night and say ‘We did a good job,’” Scott said. “It’s shady, it’s not transparent, it’s not being a leader.”
He also called out a lawmaker who he said “went behind the scenes” and said “stuff that is not what they vote,” referring to Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield. Leeper voted no on the first housing bill, then texted Lamont urging him to sign it. She said later that she wanted him to sign it, then use a special session to make changes.
Scott called on Lamont to veto the new bill.
“Let’s see if the governor listens to the people again,” Scott said. “Let’s see what kind of backbone he actually does have. We all know he flip flops on a lot of things. It goes based on the wind, who’s talking to him last.”
Senators had a similar exchange early in the debate when Sampson suggested that Democrats wanted to run the bill after the party did well in municipal elections last week.
“There was a positive result for the majority in the most recent election, and they feel like now is the time to move this overreaching piece of government-growing legislation that will have zero positive impact on the renters in the state of Connecticut but will benefit certain parties for sure,” Sampson said.
“I take exception to questioning my motives and the motives of the majority when it comes to doing this bill and how the election came out on Nov. 4, and I would ask that we not question our motives during this debate,” Duff responded.

I grew up where a plastic grocery bag was a treasure. When my mother found one, she folded it like fine linen and used it at least three times: rice today, lentils next week, and mustard greens the following month, until the handles finally gave up or there was a big hole. At the end of its life, a man on a bicycle would ride through our village, trading the torn plastic bag and other scraps for potatoes for a head of cauliflower. Nothing was “single-use.” It was resourcefulness by necessity.
Fast-forward to American supermarkets in 2025: the average plastic grocery bag is used for about 12 minutes, just long enough to move from the store to your kitchen counter, then it becomes trash destined to persist for up to 300 years in landfills or as wind-blown litter.
Then came the “reusable” fix: ban the thinnest bags, sell shoppers thicker plastic bags that, in theory, can be reused and recycled. But who really reuses them? Be honest: how often do you remember to bring your plastic bags back to the store? Most of us don’t, including myself, despite the pile of bags at my garage door. The outcome is poor: total plastic used per checkout has increased because the replacement bags are three to four times thicker than the single-use bags, and they end up as trash without being reused. 
The lesson is plain: if the fix relies only on wishful consumer behavior, it’s unlikely to be very effective. So who benefits and who loses? Manufacturers benefit from selling heavier bags; the public pays for waste fees, and microplastics persist in soil and water for up to 300 years.
There is, however, one plastic story that gives me hope because it is grounded in horticulture, my specialty: soil-biodegradable mulch (BDM). 
For those who don’t farm, plastic mulch is a thin film laid across beds to warm soil, conserve moisture, and suppress weeds. The conventional mulch version, polyethylene (PE), works perfectly for horticultural benefits but creates headaches environmentally. It must be pulled, removed, and landfilled (or worse, burned in some places or stockpiled) at season’s end. By contrast, BDMs are engineered to deliver the same horticultural benefits and then be tilled in and broken down by microbes in the soil over time. Research across many regions shows that BDMs match PE in yield and weed control performance, occasionally outperforming it and, at worst, coming close behind.


Indeed, a roll of BDM costs more upfront, but that’s not the full picture. What really matters is the total system cost. When you count the labor to pull PE, machinery time, and trucking and tipping fees, BDM comes closer to the cost of PE use. Recent extension economics from Washington State University lay out exactly how the savings from not removing and landfilling PE can offset the higher purchase price of BDM. Case studies in Tennessee and Washington show scenarios with similar or even improved net returns.
What about soil health and decomposition? Long-term research teams from UConn, Washington State University, University of Tennessee, and beyond have tracked what happens when BDM fragments are tilled in year after year. The emerging picture is reassuring that the degradation proceeds under field conditions, with recovery of only few residual fragments a couple of years after incorporation, and soil health indicators are mostly driven by climate and site, not by whether mulch was PE or BDM. Is decomposition instantaneous? No, and it depends on climate, soil microbes, and the specific polymer blend of the BDM.
Over the last decade, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has invested many millions of dollars to study BDM, from lab tests to field trials to farm budgets. That is great news, and we should be funding this kind of practical, science-based work. But policy has not kept up with the evidence. In organic farming, the rules say biodegradable mulch is allowed only if the film is fully bio-based. No mulch can meet that standard, and in practice, that rule acts like a ban even though BDMs on the market today meet the biodegradability standards. The result is that organic growers, who could benefit most from better weed control with less plastic waste, have fewer choices.
I hear another argument: “compostable” bags tear and are made from petroleum-derived components, and so aren’t they just as bad or even worse? Some biodegradable polymers are fossil-derived (e.g., PBAT), and some are biobased (e.g., PLA, PHA). The relevant comparison is not biobased versus petrochemicals, it’s whether the film biodegrades in the intended environment without accumulating as plastic pollution. If a plastic polymer blend that is 20% biobased and 80% fossil-derived meets the biodegradability standard, this beats a 100% fossil PE film for persistence, microplastic generation, labor, and landfill use.
From Nepal to the Pacific Northwest to New England, I’ve seen plastics used frugally, used wastefully, and used wisely. I think BDMs are “wise use”: they deliver horticultural benefits and cut the ugliest part of plastic’s end-of-life. The USDA helped prove that through research. The USDA could now take the important next step of aligning organic standards with the science and growers’ feedback.
Third-party standards already exist to ensure mulch films truly biodegrade in soil and meet soil-safety (toxicity) limits, and we can get into those details next time. For now, my recommendation to USDA is that the “fully biobased” standard for organic use should be revised to reflect what is feasible now or in the near future, while ensuring transparency through accurate labeling, including third-party certification.
If we could trade a torn grocery bag for potatoes in a village without paved roads, surely the richest food system on earth should be able to trade a plastic that lasts 300 years for one that quickly returns to the soil, or at least give consumers the choice to do so. The choice is not between perfect and nothing; it’s about giving the earth, consumers, and our children a better choice.

Buckel (R-Allegany) explains a Republican proposal to change how Maryland draws its eight congressional districts, and to insulate the process from partisanship. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Republicans in the General Assembly said they will propose legislation to limit partisan redistricting, by creating a new independent redistricting commission and by codifying part of a 2022 court ruling that called for compact districts with commonsense boundaries.
The legislation, which would also prohibit mid-decade redistricting, was previewed by minority party leaders Thursday, one day after a special Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission met to begin the process of a possible mid-decade partisan redistricting.
“We believe that there’s a more fair and principled way to do this than what the governor is proposing,” said House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany). “That’s why we’ll intend to be offering again, either at a special session or in the beginning of the 2026 session, the Fair Districts for Maryland Act.”
Buckel unveiled highlights of the plan with Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr (R-Upper Shore) and Del. Jesse T. Pippy (R-Frederick) and Sen. Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll), the minority whips in the House and Senate, respectively.
The Republican news conference followed Wednesday’s organizational meeting of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Committee, which is scheduled to begin taking public testimony in a virtual meeting Friday, and again Tuesday.
The five-member commission appointed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) is on a fast track to make a recommendation on congressional redistricting, possibly in time for a special legislative session in the next few weeks.

“It’s disappointing to say at least that the governor is even going down this route, and we know exactly why he’s doing it,” Pippy told reporters. “We think it’s wrong, and that’s why we’re putting forth a plan to address this.”
Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle believe the commission will lead to a special session next month. Moore has not committed to calling a special session.
If Moore calls the House and Senate back, it would be the first special session since 2021, when lawmakers met for three days in December to redraw the congressional districts based on the 2020 U.S. Census.
The latest Republican proposal, as described, is based on previous legislation and a 2022 court ruling that struck down a version of the current congressional maps. It will also include language prohibiting future attempts at midcycle redistricting.
“First thing it will do is it will put into statute and affirm once and for all that the redistricting process is a once-a-decade process,” Buckel said. “Those will be the maps that get adopted as a result of that commission. They will last until the next United States Census.
“There won’t be this every two years, every four years, every five years, depending upon how the political winds blow, ability to go in and sort of mess with the maps and change people’s expectations,” he said.
Buckel said partisan redistricting is now driven by computer programmers who use voter registration and voting patterns to craft districts that resemble “some absurd crayon drawing.”
So a second part of the latest GOP bill reworks Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan’s proposal to create an independent redistricting commission. That plan, which called for a panel of Democrats, Republicans and independents not appointed by elected officials, was “a little complicated,” in Buckel’s words, and never made it out of committee.
Republicans now envision a commission drawn from the two major parties and unaffiliated voters, but “the voting strength of the system will be set up so that no one party can run roughshod over the other,” Buckel said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Finally, the bill would codify part of a 2022 ruling that struck down the original set of maps drawn by the Legislative Redistricting Advisory Committee. Seven of the state’s eight districts in that plan favored Democrats and the eighth, the Eastern Shore-based 1st District, was drawn in such a way that it was more of a tossup than a solid Republican district that edged over the Bay Bridge into Annapolis to capture more Democratic voters.
Judge Lynn Battaglia struck that version down as “extreme partisan gerrymandering.” Her ruling mandated congressional maps to be compact and respect natural and political boundaries. The Maryland Constitution standard had at the time only applied to legislative districts.
Battaglia’s novel standard never made it to the Supreme Court of Maryland for review — lawmakers crafted a compromise map instead that cemented the current 7-1 split.
The Republican plan faces an uphill slog just to get to the floor, especially in a special session where alternative proposals and off-topic bills are typically sent to a rules committee to die.
The Democratic majority in the Senate appears, at least for now, to be uninterested in taking up mid-cycle redistricting. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said he and a majority of the 34-member Democratic Caucus do not support the midcycle redistricting being pushed by the governor. A Ferguson spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on the Republican plan.
Maryland is one of a growing number of states considering midcycle changes to its congressional districts, as parties jockey for any advantage ahead of the 2026 congressional elections.
Moore appointed a commission to review the issue. He and his handpicked panel claim the goal is to ensure the state’s three-year old districts are fair. But the panel, chaired by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.),got off to a rocky start in its first meeting Wednesday.

“It’s probably one of the most disorganized kickoff meetings and organizational meetings that we’ve ever seen,” Hershey told reporters. “I think that’s because … governor has given no clear direction on what he wants this commission to do with respect to how they’re going to go out to the public, what they’re going to ask, what they’re going to show, or what is even going to be resolved by this commission.”
A second virtual meeting is scheduled for Friday at 4 p.m.
“This redistricting effort by Gov. Wes Moore is living up to the kabuki theater we expected,” Delegate Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), vice chair of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus,  in a statement.
“Scheduling a Zoom hearing on a Friday at 4:00 p.m. is intentionally inconvenient, just as people are finishing their work week and heading home to their families, not preparing for a multi-hour hearing,” Szeliga’s statement said. “Everyone knows that’s also the classic time to dump news the administration doesn’t want anyone to notice. This process is anything but accessible and transparent.”
Szeliga was a party in the successful 2022 redistricting lawsuit, and she said last week she plans on going to court to block any midcycle map that eliminates Republican representation.
Maryland’s mid-decade redistricting effort comes after Texas kicked off a redistricting effort that benefited Republicans. California followed with a process that benefited the Democratic Party, and other states have followed suit.
Moore has not been been specific about how the current congressional district maps are inequitable. He has said he wants to “pressure test” the state’s three-year-old maps. But he also linked the effort to the national partisan push.
“My commitment stays firm that we are going to make sure that we have fair maps inside the state of Maryland, and we are not going to bend the knee to Donald Trump,” Moore said at the end of October. He added that “a special session is not off the table, regardless of what anyone else says.”
Such an effort would likely focus on a redraw that would make the state’s only Republican held congressional seat more politically hospitable to a Democratic Party challenge.
Ready said “it’s absolutely the wrong thing to try to squelch the small amount of voice for a minority party in the state.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_4989-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-11-14 05:56:17.542565

Smith Jr. will try again to pass a bill ending the practice of charging youth as adults for some offenses, saying it affects youths physically and emotionally. And if that argument doesn't work, he said it costs the state about $17 million a year.","Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) speaks about juvenile justice Thursday at a Georgetown University forum with Kris Henning (right), a Georgetown law professor, moderated by Marc Schindler, the former assistant secretary at Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) will try again to convince his legislative colleagues that automatically charging youth as adults for some offenses affects the youths both physically and emotionally.
If tugging at their heartstrings doesn’t work, he has the financial argument as backup: Doing away with the practice would save about $17 million a year, money that could be used for treatment.
“You’re not going to get services. You’re not going to get treatment. You’re going to miss school,” Smith said Thursday of youth, who can spend up to 180 days housed in adult jails while awaiting trial.
Smith said about 85% of those cases will be dismissed or sent back down to juvenile court, “so even from a technocratic efficiency piece, we’re just doing this the wrong way. If you apply that same logic to any other element of government or any other private enterprise, you say, ‘Fix it.’”
He was speaking as part of a panel Thursday at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy in Washington, D.C. The conversation titled “National Roundtable on Prosecuting Youth as Adults – Policy, Research and Practice” focused on a simple message: stop prosecuting youth as adults.
That was the goal of a bill Smith introduced in the 2025 legislative session in Annapolis. That bill would have raised the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with crimes that include first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Juvenile justice commission wants to stop automatically charging youth as adults

But critics at the time said there are some crimes, and some youths, who should be tried in the adult system. While prosecutors could petition to move some youth to adult court, that needlessly adds time to the process and endangers public safety by letting those youth start in the juvenile system, they said.
Neither Smith’s bill, nor a companion House bill, made it out of committee. But Smith said he is determined to try again in 2026.
Smith was on a panel with Georgetown law professor Kris Henning that was moderated by Marc Schindler, former assistant secretary and chief of staff with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services (DJS).
A second panel featured a couple of Georgetown University faculty members, David Muhammad, executive director of the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform based in Oakland, California, and Kyla Woods, who chairs a juvenile justice advisory group in D.C.
The more than 80 people watching the forum online and the roughly three dozen in attendance were told “plenty” of data is available that shows violent crime is mostly committed by adults.
In August, the FBIs Criminal Justice Information Division reported that of violent crime offenses cleared by law enforcement agencies in 2024, 18.5% involved (those under age 18) while 81.5% of the cleared cases were committed by adults.
One statistic about racial disparity that opened a few eyes came from Henning, who’s also a child advocate and an attorney in D.C.
“Representing kids for 26 years, I’ve only represented four white kids, and we should all be appalled by that data,” she said. “We know that racial disparity of Black children are the ones who are being” prosecuted.
In Maryland, a recent report from a workgroup of the Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging and Best Practices said that youth spent 90 to 180 days in adult jails before being transferred to juvenile court in fiscal 2024. However, federal guidelines say youth must not be held in adult facilities for more than six hours “unless a court finds it is in the interest of justice based on a seven-factor test.”
Maryland Public Defender Natasha Dartigue, in a statement released Thursday morning, applauded the commission’s recommendation to automatically end the practice of charging children as adults, especially when at least 85% of those cases are dismissed or brought back in juvenile court.
“I commend the Commission for this evidence-based recommendation and urge the Maryland General Assembly to swiftly enact legislation ensuring all children are treated as children, with access to age-appropriate interventions that hold them accountable while providing opportunities for growth and change,” she said. “Every child deserves a chance at redemption, and our system should reflect that fundamental truth.”

(Photo courtesy of CASA)A familiar face has been chosen to lead the region’s most influential immigrant rights and advocacy organization.
George Escobar, the current chief of programs and services for CASA, will become the organization’s executive director on Jan. 1, taking the reins from longtime executive director Gustavo Torres, who spent more than 30 years with the organization.
“To be entrusted with leading CASA at this critical juncture is the greatest honor of my life,” Escobar said in a statement Thursday. “Our movement faces unprecedented challenges and unmatched opportunities to grow, protect, and transform. Guided by the wisdom and resilience of our members, I believe we can emerge stronger, more united, and more impactful than ever before.”
He follows Torres, who was honored last week during a 40th anniversary celebration attended by more than 100 people, including Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Del. Deni Taveras (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the D.C. area’s largest concentration of Latinos, and is home to CASA headquarters.
Torres served as executive director for 31 of his 34 years with the organization that began in a church basement in Montgomery County. Escobar has worked 14 years for the organization, leading initiatives on legal assistance, workforce development and more. He takes over an organization that Torres helped launch into national prominence with more than 189,000 members in 46 states and Puerto Rico. Besides Maryland, CASA also has offices in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a welcome center in Georgia that opened in 2022.
Torres urges CASA advocates to push through ongoing challenges in immigrant communities

“George Escobar is exactly the leader CASA needs at this moment,” Torres said in a statement. “His deep understanding of our organization, their unwavering commitment to immigrant justice, and their visionary leadership will ensure that CASA continues to be a beacon of hope and power for generations to come.”
Escobar, who grew up in Southern California after his family immigrated from Mexico, moved to the D.C. region in 2001. Before joining CASA, he worked as deputy director in the D.C. Mayor’s Office on Latino Affairs, the National Alliance for Hispanic Health and the Latino Economic Development Corp. While with CASA, Escobar became a 2023-24 community resident affiliate at the University of Maryland’s Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center.
He will lead CASA and its fight for immigrant rights at a time of aggressive Trump administration policies to deport immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, including deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents into various cities led by Democrats.
“Our success will not be measured by our survival alone, but by lasting progressive change in our members’ lives,” Escobar said. “The future of CASA and of our movement depends on our ability to lead with courage, clarity, and the collective wisdom of our people.”
Mayor-elect Littmann, a Democratic sweep
Jared Littmann’s early lead in the Nov. 4 election for mayor of Annapolis not only held over Republican businessman Bobby O’Shea, it grew. Official results released Wednesday said Littmann, a Democrat, received 6,792 votes to O’Shea’s 2,441, or 73% to 26%.

Littman thanked supporters in a social media post in a journey he acknowledged was long,  — it started when he announced his candidacy in January 2024. Littmann will be sworn in as mayor on Dec. 1, taking over from Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited after serving two terms.
Democrats swept the City Council races, according to the official results.
The closest race was Ward 1 where Alderman Harry Huntley trailed by 10 votes on election night. But after mail-in and provisional ballots were counted, Huntley got 987 votes, compared to 889 votes for unaffiliated candidate Tom Kriek
Ward 2 Alderwoman Karma O’Neill finished with 946 votes to 507 for GOP candidate Ken Vincent, while Keanuú Smith-Brown easily beat unaffiliated candidate Mike Dye by a 620-170 margin to win the race for the open Ward 3 seat. Current Ward 3 Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles ran for mayor, but lost to Littmann in the Democratic primary.
Ward 5 Alderman Brooks Schandelmeier received 648 votes against Republican challenger Jack Papaleonti, who received 347 votes. With Ward 6 Alderman DaJuan Gray not seeking reelection, the seat was open for Diesha Contee Ward, who won 465 votes to beat Republican candidate George M. Gallagher, who got 172 votes.
Another open seat was in Ward 8, where Alderman Ross H. Arnett III did not seek reelection. Frank Thorp won with 1,128 votes to 648 for unaffiliated candidate William Cunha.
After beating Coren Makell by just four votes in thDemocratic primary, Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson (D) was unopposed in the general election for Ward 4, which is being vacated by current Alderwoman Sheila M. Finlayson (D), who did not seek reelection. Ward 7 Alderman Robert Savidge (D) had no challengers in either the primary or general elections.
Funk & Bolton staffs up

Montana hearing at the Montana Supreme Court. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)After the 2025 Legislature, Republicans who were in the majority in both chambers lamented that they didn’t get more done to refashion the state’s judiciary, vowing to take up the effort in 2027.
While lawmakers have already begun the bill drafting process for 2027, other state legislators are pushing to bring the state court system to heel. Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Barry Usher, R-Billings, filed a trio of complaints  against one of the state’s seven Supreme Court justices, Laurie McKinnon, late this summer.
The three complaints that Usher brought to the Montana Judicial Standards Commission, the body that oversees judicial discipline, have already been decided, two of them years ago by the previous commission. One of the issues — whether the Montana Supreme Court justices could hear matters pertaining to state’s court system — was rejected by the United States Supreme Court.
Broadly speaking, the charges involve allegations that McKinnon has violated judicial norms by not silencing an attorney at a panel in which she moderated; that she had a conflict of interest in deciding the legality of legislation that would redraw the Supreme Court into districts; and that she failed to recuse herself in a tussle with the Legislature over emails.
Even though the issues and events surrounding the complaints have been litigated and settled, that has not stopped some Republicans from continuing to fight. Now, Usher has targeted McKinnon, who has been a part of rulings on some of the cases which have been decided against the lawmakers, on occasion writing opinions on behalf of the court. While no facts involving Usher’s allegations have changed — in some cases for years — what has changed is the retooling and remaking of the Judicial Standards Commission itself, which could mete out judicial discipline.
In 2023, a Republican supermajority rejiggered how the members of the Judicial Standards Commission are chosen. Democrats and others decried the changes as injecting more politics in the nonpartisan court system, while Republicans argued commission should better reflect the political reality of the Treasure State. 
  The complaints 

Usher submitted the three complaints on Aug. 17 to the JSC . The Daily Montanan reached out to Usher for comment about them, and he originally replied that the complaints speak for themselves.

Later, Usher decided to release a comment through a legislative spokesperson:



“I am disappointed to see Justice McKinnon leaking information to the state’s most left-wing media outlet in an attempt to influence public opinion and sway the commission’s important work on judicial standards complaints. This calculated move raises serious concerns over her fitness for judicial office.”
 

In almost all cases, complaints against judges, submitted to the JSC, are confidential. However, Montana law allows a judge to waive that right and provide public notice of the proceedings. McKinnon has waived her right of privacy in the matter for the Daily Montanan in order to demonstrate how political the fight over the state’s judicial branch has become:


        “The citizens of Montana should know the depth of the attacks on the judiciary that are occurring. The allegations lodged by Usher are baseless and calculated to intimidate, harass, threaten, and – more significantly – silence a member of the highest court of this state, particularly where there are a multitude of constitutional challenges before the Court to recently enacted statutes supported by Usher.  I will, as I always have, decide any case before the Court based on our law, our precedent, and Montana’s Constitution – free from partisan influence, and of course Usher’s attempt to influence. As a leader in Montana’s judicial branch, it is my duty to disclose and repudiate these partisan attacks, which weaken, infect, and threaten our democracy. The idea that a Justice would succumb to threats or be silenced by Usher’s allegations, as the obvious intended purpose here, is inconsistent with the principles and health of a democracy.  I will not turn a blind eye to what is occurring, and I have faith that through my responses and disclosure to Montana citizens, these attacks on the judiciary’s independence will not be kept in the dark but, rather, inform and enlighten how our State should govern going forward.”    

In letters, the Judicial Standards Commission on Sept. 17 asked McKinnon to respond in writing to the allegations. McKinnon hired an attorney, Patricia Klanke, to respond to the allegations, which appear to still be active with the commission.
The Daily Montanan reached out to members of the commission to discuss the complaints or the process, but none of them responded to requests. By law, members cannot speak about the complaints, but they can acknowledge them or describe or clarify the process.
The first complaint by Usher alleges that McKinnon failed to uphold the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct by not recusing herself from a controversy involving the Legislature, of which he was a member, and its subpoena for thousands of email records from the state’s judicial branch.
In 2021, Republican lawmakers had charged that because a statewide judges association polled members of the judiciary on legislative topics during the session that it indicated political bias. In a hurried subpoena, the Legislature demanded thousands of emails from then Court Administrator Beth McLaughlin, with threats of legal action if she didn’t comply with the subpoenas during a weekend.
Meanwhile McLaughlin and her attorney filed emergency petitions with the Montana Supreme Court asking to halt or slow the process because of sensitive, private and confidential information that would likely be in many of those emails, including communication about court cases, juveniles and medical records. 
That escalated in a stand-off that entangled all three branches of state government, culminating in orders to return the emails, some of which had already been distributed to the public, and the state’s highest court stopping the subpoena for emails issued by lawmakers.
The controversy didn’t end with the decision, though. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, threatened not to obey the high court, which became the basis of currently pending disciplinary action against him still before the Montana Supreme Court. McKinnon has recused herself from that disciplinary case.
But during the tussle over whether to release the judicial branch’s emails, Republican lawmakers claimed the Supreme Court justices, including McKinnon, had a conflict of interest and must recuse themselves. The Supreme Court denied the conflict and said even if one existed, that every qualified judge in the state would have the same conflict and cited a principle called the“rule of judicial necessity,” which says if every judge has the same perceived conflict then the sitting justices must do their best to adjudicate matter. 
After years of fighting and a mountain of legal briefing, the case was appealed by Knudsen all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided the matter when it declined to hear the case, leaving the Montana Supreme Court’s decisions to stand.
One member of the state’s high court, Justice Jim Rice, had recused himself in the case and dissented in a separate opinion, arguing that a different legal route was correct by challenging those lawmaker-issued subpoenas in state district court first.
In the complaint against McKinnon, Usher parlays that into a reason for the commission to “impose the maximum sanction on (her).”
In his complaint, Usher said that the state Supreme Court has ignored the conflict of interest.
“They claim the issue is a matter of law they alone can decide — an absurd argument, as Justice Rice’s recusal demonstrates,” the complaint said.
The second complaint against McKinnon focuses on a 2021 debate and effort to change the state’s constitution, which elects nonpartisan Supreme Court Justices at large. A proposal, House Bill 325, would have altered that by districting the state into seven different geographic regions and having electors in those regions elect a single justice from there.
Residents challenged the measure’s constitutionality, and the Second District Court in Butte found in favor of the residents. The state appealed the decision, and the Montana Supreme Court, the state’s only appellate court, was called upon to decide the matter.
Again, Republicans from both the legislative and executive branches charged that the entire state Supreme Court should be disqualified because of a conflict of interest. However, using law that paralleled its ruling in the McLaughlin case, the court said that conflicts were speculative and that voters had the final say on the election of judges.
In his complaint, Usher said that McKinnon should have disqualified herself, arguing that “given the nature of this case dealing with how Supreme Court Justices are elected, thereby increasing or decreasing the chances of any particular justice being re-elected, the (sic) Justice McKinnon had a clear economic interest in the outcome of this case.”
However, in their ruling on the case, the Supreme Court determined those interests were conjecture or theoretical, because the complaints assume so many things, for example, that the constitutional ballot measure would pass, the districts would not favor the current justices, and that justices would want to run for office again.
The third complaint against McKinnon alleges that she failed to follow the Montana Code of Judicial conduct when she was moderating a panel discussion at a continuing education course sponsored by the Montana State Bar Association.
The complaint accuses her of showing bias and violating the code when a longtime attorney, who had been asked to participate at the last minute, made comments that offended some conservative lawmakers and were harshly critical of Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, and the court itself.
That conference and particular session became a flashpoint for Republican legislation during the 2025 Legislature to reform not only the state’s judicial branch, but overhaul the state’s legal community altogether by not requiring attorneys to join the bar, as well as calling for a full financial audit by state auditors of the bar, which is a private organization.
Usher charges that “Justice McKinnon did not attempt to restrain (Jim) Goetz’s comments,” and says that she “giggled” at his remarks.
Klanke of the Drake Law Firm in Helena has responded to the allegations on behalf of McKinnon, her client.
In separate responses for each allegation, Klanke points out that many of the same issues have been litigated before the Judicial Standards Commission and even the Supreme Court previously. Klanke’s responses to the allegations total 22 pages, and include exhibits, swelling the total to around 100 pages in total.
Klanke said the Supreme Court addressed the disqualifying of Supreme Court justices in its 2022 findings.
“Usher’s grievance reflects his dissatisfaction with this ruling…This is not the first time Sen. Usher has filed this complaint,” she stated.
Indeed, Usher filed a similar complaint against McKinnon in 2022, along with accusing Supreme Court Justices Beth Baker, Ingrid Gustafson, Jim Rice, Dirk Sandefur, James Shea, and Chief Justice Mike McGrath, with similar allegations. Baker, Gustafson, Rice, and Shea are still on the court.
“The grievance now filed against Justice McKinnon is identical, down to the formatting, even using plural references to ‘themselves’ and ‘the Justices’ and containing the same typo ‘rescues’ in place of ‘recuse,’” Klanke said.
In 2022, Usher was not the only lawmaker to file the same complaint — on the same day. Reps. John Fuller and Matt Regier filed as well as Sen. Cary Smith and the late-Sen. Gordon Vance. 
All five complaints were dismissed by the Judicial Standards Commission in 2022.
“If the decision of the commission, or indeed any judicial principles, are to mean anything, a grievance that has been rejected five times should also be rejected the sixth time,” Klanke wrote.
Klanke points to a 2012 decision that has been used many times during these conflicts, which analyzed the role of Supreme Court justices and when they should recuse themselves. The case centered on whether four sitting Supreme Court justices should recuse themselves because they had the potential to run for re-election.
That case established the precedent that “potential” conflict did not constitute “a direct, personal, substantial, and pecuniary interest sufficient to trigger due process concerns.”
Moreover, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in the McLaughlin case previously that since every judge in the state likely had interacted with McLaughlin, the courts, or could run again, that none were more able to rule on the case than the justices on the Supreme Court.
“There was no member of the of judiciary who was without at least a conjectural interest,” Klanke’s response stated, arguing that if taken to its logical conclusion, no judge in the state would have been able to decide the complaints raised by the McLaughlin case or the matter or districting the Supreme Court seats.
In the McLaughlin case, the high court reasoned that if it disqualified “every member of Montana’s highest court … the court’s ability to fulfill its constitutional duties to adjudicate difficult and controversial matters would be compromised.”
“Montana citizens elected Justice McKinnon to the Supreme Court, and the matter should be decided by the duly elected and constituted Justice of the court,” Klanke responded to Usher’s allegations.
Klanke’s response also notes the different cases that the Montana Supreme Court has decided that involved making decisions on the judiciary or the court administrator, stretching back several decades.
The high court, as it decided in McLaughlin, said that the Legislature had purposefully subpoenaed every member of the court, creating both a crisis and a scenario meant to discredit every justice. 
“The Legislature’s unilateral act of issuing subpoenas to the justices during the pendency of this case is not grounds for recusal of every member of this court,” the Supreme Court wrote in its opinion. “The Legislature itself has created the conflict by issuing a subpoena to each justice during a pending proceeding involving the same issues raised in a legislative subpoena.”
In his complaint against her, Usher repeated the claim that the justices, McKinnon included, used their positions to hide emails that were unflattering, another point the Supreme Court addressed in its original ruling in the McLaughlin case.
“The Legislature has failed to provide a single legitimate legislative purpose tied to matters ‘concerning a subject on which “legislation could be had.”’ The asserted legislative purpose —both expressed in the subpoena and in the Legislature’s findings with the court — is to determine whether individuals violated the law. Enforcement of the law is not a ‘legitimate task’ of the legislative function,” the court ruling said.
“The allegations made by Usher are extremely disturbing, as they are the same arguments made in Reichert, McLaughlin and McDonald which were rejected by the court,” Klanke wrote. “Based upon this clear existing law, when the exact same complaint was filed before the commission three years ago, it was summarily dismissed.”
It appears that McKinnon, as opposed to other justices, may have been targeted because she was the moderator of a panel, “Profiles in Courage,” which she had participated in, in conjunction with the State Bench Bar Education Committee.
With 15 minutes until the beginning of the panel, one of the panelists had not arrived, and with veteran attorney Jim Goetz in attendance, he was asked to participate because of his involvement in many controversial cases before the state Supreme Court, according to Klanke.
Each of the panelists spoke, and McKinnon moderated. The full presentation and discussion has been made available previously. Usher’s complaint against McKinnon focuses on seven different comments made by Goetz during the panel discussion, none of which are attributed to McKinnon. In his complaint, Usher charges that McKinnon failed to ” restrain the comments of Mr. Goetz.” Usher also accused her of being “willing to allow Mr. Goetz to engage in this inappropriate (sic) constitutes,” while also alleging she failed to report Goetz’s behavior afterward.
Usher’s complaints against Goetz include that during the panel discussion he called one of the rulings on a case he litigated “a piece of shit,” while during the same panel criticizing some of the laws passed by the legislature as “pieces of garbage.” One of Goetz’s criticisms was aimed at district court judge Dan Wilson, who ran unsuccessfully for a Montana Supreme Court seat in 2024, and has announced his intent to run again in 2026.
Since then, Wilson has also become a member of the Judicial Standards Commission.
In her defense of McKinnon, Klanke responded that the justice simply moderated the panel, not offered advice or commentary.
“McKinnon moved the discussion from one panelist to another, being careful not to opine on their positions, particularly those disagreements about matters that had been decided by the court,” Klanke said. “McKinnon neither endorsed the statements of the panelists, nor adopted any of the statements, and did not make them herself.
“This does not mean she should have interjected herself to silence First Amendment speech. The panelists were entitled to voice their opinion about the court’s decision and how the court was functioning. They were entitled to speak of their frustration with litigating against various parties. Had Justice McKinnon interjected herself into the discussion, she would have done exactly what Usher is alleging she did here — showing a bias or partisanship toward a particular position or part.”
Klanke also rejected the idea that she should have stopped Goetz from speaking, noting that judges are often in the same position while on the bench.
“Avoiding impropriety does not mean putting a stop to all speech or conduct that is in bad taste or may cause offense to others,” Klanke wrote. “Indeed, the role of a judge is very often to uphold the rights of others to make offensive speech. It was not illegal for Mr. Goetz to state his opinion, and there is no law or rule that required Justice McKinnon to intervene to prevent him from doing so.”
The response points out that none of the panelists were court staff or “under Justice McKinnon’s control.”
“Mr. Goetz’s statements were not dishonest or untrustworthy, however disagreeable some may have found them, and they reflected his deep displeasure with the administration of justice in this state,” Klanke wrote. “Usher’s allegations are premised upon the mistaken belief that the panelists were under the direction or control of McKinnon.”
  Changes to the JSC 

While the Judicial Standards Commission has rejected nearly identical complaints at least five times, this sixth time is different because the Legislature retooled the commission itself to allow politicians more control over the make-up of the panel.
In 2023, Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings, sponsored and helped pass House Bill 326, which rewrote the rules on how commission members are selected. Raising concerns about “judges judging judges” and likening the situation to the fox guarding the henhouse, the Legislature passed the bill, mostly along political party lines.  The House voted 66-32, with a notable exception of then-Rep. Bill Mercer, who was recently confirmed by the United States Senate to the federal bench in Montana, and took the oath of office in Missoula.
In the Montana Senate, the bill was more controversial, with a number of Republican Senators breaking off from the majority. Still, the measure made it through the chamber 29-21 and was signed into law by Gianforte.
Under the new law, the number of people appointed to the commission remained at five. Instead of two district court judges being elected by the district judges themselves, the judges are appointed by the Montana Speaker of the House and confirmed by the Senate. The Montana Supreme Court under the old system appointed the one practicing attorney, but under the new rules, that attorney is appointed by the Montana Attorney General. The two lay members of the commission are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, something that remained unchanged by HB 326.
During the debates some lawmakers worried that move would inject more partisan politics into a system designed to eschew political party influence.
The current make-up of the commission includes the chairwoman of the Commission, Yellowstone County District Court Judge Ashley Harada. The other judge on the commission is Wilson.  The attorney appointed by the Attorney General is Emily Jones, who has served as a special assistant to Austin Knudsen, and is often involved in many of the high-profile political cases the office handles. The two members of the public are former legislators Seth Berglee and Roger Webb of Park City. Both were appointed by Gianforte and both are Republican.
  Conflicts of interest? 

The members of the Judicial Standards Commission have changed since these issues were originally addressed. Unlike the other nearly identical complaints, this trio of complaints appears to be different. The previous complaints were all summarily dismissed, which meant that the commission read and reviewed them, rejecting them without asking the judge accused in the complaint for a response.
In each of these three complaints, the commission asked McKinnon for a response, and did not reject the complaint, meaning the commission’s investigation or deliberation is ongoing. 
But in both the response provided by McKinnon and in the Daily Montanan’s own investigation, it appears that four of the five members of the commission may have their own conflicts of interest in the case.
Harada herself has been the subject of a disciplinary complaint against her that was ultimately upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. As part of that process, McKinnon signed a disciplinary order, along with six other members of the court, suspending Harada for one month without pay and censuring her.
Harada agreed to the punishment and concurred with the commission and court findings, which included a failure to withhold state and federal taxes from a nanny who worked for her; acknowledging she lied under oath about the situation; making misleading statements about her legal experience; making endorsements of candidates; as well as accepting an endorsement from a political party, which was, at the time, illegal, but has since been changed by state law as part of a Republican effort to “reform” the court system of Montana.

Wilson ran for a seat on the Montana Supreme Court, being bested by current Justice Katherine Bidegaray. He has announced that he’s an active candidate seeking election to the Supreme Court in the 2026 race. And Wilson was the target of at least one of the comments that Usher claims McKinnon should have stopped at the panel discussion.
That comment from Goetz was:
“And the other thing that got my attention was Judge Wilson complimenting the court on the Judicial Nomination Commission case, which I and Cliff Edwards handled …. And when Judge Wilson said that was an even opinion, it’s a piece of shit.”
Also, according to a Montana Legislature report that examined the role of the judiciary in terms of lobbying or bias, it found that Wilson used his state email account to vote on an informal poll about pending legislation before the lawmakers.
Emily Jones is a well-known attorney, working particularly in Republican circles, and is married to prominent political consultant and campaign director Jake Eaton.
Jones has been part of major pieces of litigation as a special assistant attorney general, and records show that she’s been receiving a $10,000 per month payment from the office, and was first called in to help litigate the McLaughlin case. She was on the losing side of that argument, which McKinnon signed onto.
In addition to that, Jones herself was sanctioned by a state in court in Helena for a 2017 case where Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley found that her actions in case usurped the court’s inherent ability to “control discovery and trial administration in the interest of fairness and justice.”
She was sanctioned, ordered to pay for the Commissioner of Political Practices attorneys fees, and then a record was sent to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, which oversees attorney discipline. According to a search of the state’s disciplinary database, that office never took further action against Jones.
However, Jones’ name has been attached to some of the highest profile lawsuits in the Attorney General’s Office, including many that the Montana Supreme Court found against. Those have included cases involving defending legislation ranging from reproductive freedom to the Attorney General finding certain ballot initiatives “insufficient” to defending the state’s position on transgender individuals wanting to select their gender marker on a driver’s license.
But, it’s not even the first time that Jones has, as an attorney for the state, tried to punish McKinnon for not muzzling Goetz. In a 2024 case regarding the driver’s licenses, Jones made a motion to disqualify McKinnon because she “failed to take the measure to cease the offending discussion.” Because that case was dismissed before it was decided by the court, the court did not make a ruling on the motion.
It appears that Usher also waited on Jones’ appointment to the JSC. She was appointed on July 1, and Usher filed the complaints surrounding Goetz’s comments on Aug. 17. Goetz’s comments by then had been made more than a year earlier and already had been dismissed by the former commission.
Jones’ husband, Eaton, filed an identical complaint as the one Usher filed against McKinnon.
“The present complaint by Sen. Usher is almost a word-for-word duplicate of Eaton’s, with even the same line break error on page two of the attached statement,” Klanke noted.
She also pointed out that several verb tenses were changed, for example when referencing McLaughin, the court administrator at the time of case. The complaint now states that she “was” the court administrator. It also appears that Usher may have tried to differentiate the filing slightly, which Klanke noted: “‘This case reveals a clear coverup,’ in place of ‘This case is a coverup, plain and simple.’”
Klanke also noted that Eaton’s original complaint included a demand to force the recusal of Judges Mike Menahan and Randal Spaulding, former members of the JSC, who were replaced by Harada and Wilson. Those sections have now been dropped.
Moreover, Usher has legislative involvement with both Harada and Wilson.
“Usher, the grievant in this case, sponsored bills to confirm both Harada and Wilson to the commission,” Klanke said. 
Meanwhile, former Carbon County lawmaker Seth Berglee, who now lists his address as Whitefish, was a defendant in a case that wound its way to the Supreme Court, which found in his favor, but not without a wrinkle. McKinnon wrote the opinion on behalf of the Supreme Court.
That case, which was decided in June 2025, was a split decision, with Justice Jim Rice dissenting. The case involves a company in which Berglee has an ownership interest and a dispute involving a former partner. McKinnon’s decision, which was written on behalf of the majority, ultimately said that Berglee and several other partners were correct in not associating with a former partner. However, the opinion could wind up costing Berglee more money because the court ordered the district court to redo some of its calculations for paying out the ex-partner.
  And back to the Supreme Court 

Should the Judicial Standards Commission find merit in the complaints, or even recommend sanctioning or disciplinary action against McKinnon, it will not have the final say on the matter. The JSC makes recommendations to the one group that has power over the courts according to the Montana Constitution, the Montana Supreme Court.
That means that if the JSC recommends disciplinary sanctions, it could set off another series of motions and possible accusations that seem to be at the heart of the original complaint more than four years ago: The justices seated on the Montana Supreme Court will be in charge of determining the fate of McKinnon, one of their colleagues. 
For his part, Usher’s trio of complaints urges the commission to take a hard-line stance against McKinnon.
“This commission has the authority and responsibility to find that Justice McKinnon violated her ethical obligations. Given the severity of these violations, the commission should impose the maximum sanctions on Justice McKinnon,” the complaints urge.
For her part, McKinnon has requested that the complaints be dismissed and the commission award her attorney’s fees for having to defend cases she says have already been litigated, several times.
“It is unclear why the commission determined that an investigation into Usher’s allegations was warranted, given that his complaints clearly involve orders and decision of the Montana Supreme Court, requiring the commission, under its own rules, to dismiss the grievance summarily,” Klanke said in her response on behalf of McKinnon. “It is Justice McKinnon’s sincere hope that the commission applies its own rules correctly and interprets the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct in a fair and nonpartisan matter.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_7939-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 22:56:29.950323

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) Director Peter Alviti Jr. admitted to lawmakers Thursday that he has not personally reviewed engineering plans of the westbound Washington Bridge shut down in December 2023.
That’s because he said it’s ultimately up to the companies contracted by the state to look them over and identify any issues that arise — even the ones that failed to catch the broken anchor rods that put the westbound Interstate 195 highway at risk of collapse.
“We expect them to deliver a report that is complete and accurate, and we don’t second-guess them,” Alviti told members of the House and Senate oversight committees. “We rely on their expertise and their reporting so that we can serve the public — and they betrayed that.”
It’s the third time since the state abruptly closed the western span over the Seekonk River that lawmakers have put Alviti in the hot seat. Unlike his previous two appearances in the State House basement, Rhode Island’s transportation chief was required to testify under oath and had to answer before the state’s most recent top federal prosecutor.
“This committee has an obligation to understand the circumstances that led to this event and what we can do to avoid this happening again,” Rep. Patricia Serpa, the West Warwick Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Oversight, said in her opening remarks of the five-hour meeting.
Lawmakers requested the third oversight hearing after the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General quietly released a long-sequestered forensic audit that showed the state was partially to blame for its deteriorated condition.
The 64-page report by Illinois-based engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates Inc. dated April 5, 2024, was posted on the AG’s website this September after pieces were leaked by an anonymous social media account. 
Gov. Dan McKee had promised to make the audit public when he announced at a March 2024 press conference that the bridge would need to be rebuilt, but ultimately chose to keep it out of the public eye amid the state’s lawsuit against the 13 firms that performed work on the bridge.
The lawsuit also inhibited the committee’s ability to ask questions surrounding accountability when lawmakers last met on Feb. 13.
“We were told we can’t ask questions about anything pertaining to causation,” Sen. Mark McKenney, the Warwick Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Rules, Government Ethics and Oversight, said in an interview before Thursday’s hearing. “That was extremely frustrating.”

With the chance now to get answers under oath, the joint panel tapped a veteran prosecutor to grill Alviti: former U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha, who served three years under the Biden administration before being ousted last February by the Trump administration.
A repeated line of questioning from Cunha focused on who at RIDOT is responsible for assessing inspection reports from its network of contractors. Alviti explained that one individual, the state program manager, oversees the “outsourcing and contracting with” multiple bridge inspection companies.
But Alviti said he could not recall that person’s name, and that they haven’t regularly met either before or after the bridge’s closure.
“I feel bad that I don’t,” he said. “I should.”
“Sounds like a fairly important position,” Cunha replied.
Alviti said the position has its place, but that all employees at RIDOT play a role. He also disagreed with Cunha’s suggestion that the project manager is the ultimate authority on reviewing the accuracy of inspection reports.
“The program manager basically oversees and manages the outsourcing and contracting,” he said.
Cunha said RIDOT’s approach is “contractors all the way down.” 
“Is RIDOT helpless to do anything other than sign contracts and pay out money?” he asked.
About 90 minutes into the hearing, Alviti asked for a short recess, saying his voice was getting raspy. When the committee reconvened around 10 minutes later, he wasn’t in his seat — prompting Serpa to ask Capitol Police to look for him. Alviti returned shortly after.
“We were afraid you left us,” Serpa said.

‘Where does the buck stop?’
Following a second recess, committee members were given the chance to ask questions of Alviti, starting with lawmakers from the East Bay whose constituents are bearing the most impact of the bridge’s closure.
Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat, told Alviti it was “very frustrating” to hear of RIDOT’s overreliance on contractors and asked how she can maintain confidence that future bridge maintenance is done properly.
“Where does the buck stop?” she said. “It can’t always stop with consultants.”
Alviti insisted RIDOT is the most accountable department in the state and that using outside contractors has helped reconstruct hundreds of structurally deficient bridges. When he took up the job in 2015 following his appointment by then-Gov. Gina Raimondo, he told lawmakers the department did much of the bridge work in-house, leading to many projects running over time and over budget. 
“We turned that all around,” Alviti said.
Still, Alviti’s assurances did little to comfort lawmakers.
“Much of what we have heard today does not instill confidence in the inspection regime,” said Rep. June Speakman, a Bristol Democrat.










Is RIDOT helpless to do anything other than sign contracts and pay out money?


– Zachary Cunha, the former U.S. attorney hired by lawmakers to question the state’s transportation director


Alviti continues to receive support from McKee, who has refuted calls to replace his transportation chief. But who is the best person for the DOT director’s job has already emerged as a hot button campaign issue. And McKee’s Democratic primary opponent was quick to weigh in after the oversight hearing ended and remind the public what she would do if elected.
Helena Bounanno Foulkes, who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary, called for Alviti to be fired.
“This oversight hearing was a disaster for the McKee Administration,” Foulkes said in a statement Thursday night. “It confirmed what Rhode Islanders already knew: the State refuses to take responsibility for years of neglect and mismanagement.”
The main question on lawmakers’ minds was how RIDOT will make sure infrastructure problems are caught sooner rather than later and that the state never has another Washington Bridge debacle again.
In his closing statement, Alviti sought to reassure them. He said the new westbound Washington Bridge will be built to be strong, safe, and easy to be maintained and inspected.
Chicago-headquartered Walsh Construction Company was awarded the state’s $427 million contract to rebuild the Washington Bridge on June 6. Construction is expected to be completed by November 2028.
“We’ve got the best contractor in the country doing it for us,” Alviti said. “What happened with the Washington Bridge will not happen again.”

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Black Hills Energy was using a phased approach to restore electricity as a widespread power outage that began early Thursday afternoon stretched into the evening, affecting thousands in Rapid City and the surrounding region.
“We are continuing to work as quickly as possible to safely restore service to all South Dakota and Wyoming customers impacted by today’s regional electrical outage,” the company said Thursday evening in a news release.
“The restoration process is complex as our power generation facilities and substations were impacted. We will use a phased process to restore power which balances system safety and stability.”
Black Hills Energy said the outage impacted multiple utilities across the region, resulting from an event on the regional transmission grid outside of the Black Hills Energy footprint. That footprint includes Rapid City, South Dakota’s second largest population center, where power was out all afternoon for many people and some street lights remained dark into the evening.
The website PowerOutage.us said at one point Thursday afternoon that more than 40,000 customers in South Dakota were affected, and more than 60,000 in Wyoming.
WyoFile quoted a spokesman for the Western Area Power Administration who said the outage began around 12:45 p.m. Mountain time and may have been triggered by “two tripped 500-kilovolt lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming.”
“This incident resulted in an abnormal voltage event that subsequently tripped a number of surrounding lines, including WAPA transmission, resulting in further power outages to communities across the area,” Public Affairs Specialist Stephen J.

Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, listens to a presentation during a South Dakota legislative budget committee meeting on Jan. 15, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of South Dakota lawmakers expressed support Thursday for legislative efforts to rein in powers that some committee members said Republican former Gov. Kristi Noem abused.
The Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee, which met at the Capitol in Pierre, endorsed draft legislation that would take a pool of economic development money known as the Future Fund out of the governor’s exclusive control.
Committee members also expressed informal support — but did not formally endorse — another bill draft that would tighten rules governing the use of state-issued credit cards.
Both ideas could become bills when legislators gather for their annual lawmaking session in January.
“This is trying to provide some more oversight and transparency,” said Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, who serves as committee chair and introduced the bill drafts.
Future Fund
South Dakota employers pay a fee to the Future Fund when they submit payroll taxes to the unemployment benefits program. State law says the Future Fund must be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” Unlike other funds administered by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, Future Fund expenses don’t go through a board of citizen appointees for vetting or approval. The governor has sole discretion to award Future Fund money.
Noem’s controversial uses of the Future Fund included $350,000 to pay for a fireworks show in 2020 at Mount Rushmore, $13.5 million toward the construction of a Rapid City-area shooting range that opened last week, $2.5 million to promote and conduct a Governor’s Cup rodeo in Sioux Falls, and up to $9 million on a workforce recruitment campaign that Noem starred in.
Some lawmakers upset after Noem awards millions to project they refused to pay for

Legislators denied state funding for the shooting range before Noem awarded the Future Fund money.
“I think everyone remembers the fact that funding was denied for the new gun range, what was it – three or four times?” Howard said. “And lo and behold, Future Funds were given to complete that project, which, in my opinion, subverted the appropriations process.”
The bill draft, which the committee endorsed 7-1 with two members excused, would require each Future Fund grant to be approved by a majority of the Board of Economic Development, which already oversees other programs controlled by the governor’s office. The board’s members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate.
The bill would also order the Governor’s Office of Economic Development to create rules establishing an application process for Future Fund loans and grants; the methods for assessing or estimating the economic impact that a project would have on the state; the criteria for determining how a project is selected for a loan or a grant; the process for setting an interest rate on a loan; any requirements that applicants must meet to be awarded a grant; and the process by which a loan or a grant is disbursed.
Credit cards
A Dakota Scout investigation earlier this year uncovered roughly $750,000 in charges to Noem’s state-issued credit cards over six years, including travel tied to a book tour and a Canadian hunting trip. 
“I mean, the previous governor traveled to more than 30 states,” Howard said. “Places that you really had to wonder if every one of those was done on official state business. So, unfortunately, this is somewhat of a blowback because of previous actions.” 
Noem resigned in January to become secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security.

The bill addressing credit cards would direct the state Bureau of Finance and Management to write rules for how a state officer or employee can be issued a bank card, what criteria are used to assess that request, and maximum amounts for lodging, meals, transportation and other expenses charged. The bill would also establish a process to recover from an employee’s wages any spending above those caps. 
Sen. Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said the committee ran out of time Thursday, but he hopes to keep discussing the bill draft.
“I support the idea,” he said. “It needs to be workshopped a little bit.”
Karr voted in favor of the committee endorsing “the idea of” the bill, which Howard suggested following Karr’s comments. That motion passed 6-1, with three members excused.
Another of Howard’s drafts would have required that any expense incurred by the governor, in connection with state business conducted outside the state, must be reviewed by the State Board of Finance. That draft failed in a 5-3 vote, with two committee members excused. The motion needed a six-vote majority of the committee’s 10 members. 
Sen. Ernie Otten, R-Tea, was the only member to vote against all three bill drafts. He did not explain his votes publicly.

“For over three decades, I’ve seen how the University of Alaska empowers this state,” Pitney said in a prepared statement with the announcement. “Our education, research, and partnerships make a difference in every community. As an alum, and the parent of alums from each of our three universities, it’s been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve all of you and the people of Alaska.”
Pitney was appointed by the University of Alaska Board of Regents, first as interim president in August 2020, then as president in February 2022. She oversees the state’s public higher education system with three universities and 13 community campuses, over 500 in-person and online degree programs, and numerous research initiatives. It’s currently serving 20,500 students this year. 
Pitney said Thursday that in retirement, she plans to stay in Alaska and spend time with her children and grandchildren. “Mostly take some time off, enjoy the summer in Alaska. I’ve been fortunate to travel to a lot of places in Alaska, but there’s a lot of places I haven’t been to,” she said, like the Aleutian Islands and the Denali Highway. 
“​​I’m sure I’ll be engaged in other things, but just not, you know, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,” she said. 
Pitney led the university through the COVID-19 pandemic, and has been recognized by the university and its board of regents for her leadership through financial instability, helping to boost enrollment, scholarship opportunities, research initiatives and revenue. She is credited by the university with increasing its public confidence rating, with 86% of Alaskans reporting approval of UA in 2024, according to a university survey. 
“Not only has she been a steady hand at the wheel during challenging times, but she has also refocused our university system and embraced our role as an engine that empowers Alaska’s workforce and economy,” said Scott Jepsen, chair of the University Board of Regents in a statement. “On behalf of the Board and the entire university community, I extend our sincerest thanks to Pat for her committed service to UA and the people of Alaska.”
This year, the Trump administration has exerted unprecedented political pressure on higher education institutions across the country, freezing millions in federal funding, revoking international student visas and demanding changes to and elimination of diversity programs. When asked whether the political environment played a role in her decision, Pitney said it did not, and that she sees both uncertainty and opportunity for the university and for Alaska today.
“It is a time of uncertainty. But when I walked in, it was a time of uncertainty,” she said. “We go through cycles of uncertainty and stress, and then there’s cycles of really positive momentum and, actually, even in this period of uncertainty, we have a ton of positive momentum.”
She said the federal freeze of research funding has been painful for some programs, but overall minimal. She added that Alaska also has opportunities in resource development, defense partnerships and in the Arctic. “We are really well positioned in the Arctic,” she said. “Our expertise in Arctic research and Arctic policy have really positioned Alaska well. So as much as there is uncertainty, and, you know, frankly, just a weird environment, on the other side, Alaska and the University of Alaska have tremendous opportunities at this time.”
Prior to serving as the university’s 17th president, Pitney oversaw state finances as the director of the Alaska State Legislative Finance Division in 2020, and she was the State Finance Director in the administration of former Governor Bill Walker from 2014 to 2018. Pitney was the Vice Chancellor of Administration at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and spent 23 years in various roles in research, planning, and finance administration.
Pitney first came to Fairbanks in 1987 from Billings, Montana. She holds a bachelor’s degree in engineering physics from Murray State University, and an MBA from the University of Alaska UAF. She also is an Olympian; Pitney won gold in women’s air rifle in the 1984 U.S Olympic Games. 
The university Board of Regents said it has already started planning for Pitney’s retirement and has retained WittKieffer, a national executive search firm, to assist with the search and recruitment of the next university president.
From now until May, Pitney said her goals are to continue the university’s focus on student recruitment, retention and graduation, which she called their “top focus,” as well as helping with the search to find her replacement. “And then really just reinforcing the team atmosphere that we’ve had that’s been growing over the past five years,” she said. 
The UA Board of Regents is also in the process of recruiting and hiring permanent chancellors at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Correction: This story has been updated to clarify Pitney’s terms as the director of the Alaska State Legislative Finance Division and as state finance director. The story previously misstated the university was hiring for a permanent chancellor at UAA.

The voter engagement project founded by Stacey Abrams in 2013 announced in October that it was dissolving after the Georgia Ethics Commission concluded the organization violated state campaign finance law and charged the group a $300,000 fine, the largest fine for an ethics violation in state history.

Ethics commission executive director David Emadi said the New Georgia Project admitted to the violations after a lengthy legal process.
“They admitted they failed to register as an independent committee or super PAC,” he said. “They admitted they failed to file all required disclosure reports in the 2018 primary and general election. They admitted they failed to disclose over $4 million … They admitted failing to disclose in those reports over just over $3.2 million in political expenditures.”
Abrams, a former state House minority leader, left the group in 2017 ahead of her first run for governor in 2018, when her near-win made her a national star.
Emadi said the money was spent on items including staff, canvassers and phone bankers in offices across the state. Some of the violations were also tied to an unsuccessful 2019 MARTA expansion ballot initiative in Gwinnett County.
Emadi said Abrams may have separated from the group before her first run for governor, but investigators are still looking into whether she was coordinating with the group after officially stepping back, which would be another violation of state law.
Sen. Bill Cowsert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
A GOP-led panel Thursday floated ideas for legislation that members said would discourage organizations from illegally funding political candidates in the 2026 midterms and beyond.
State Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican who chairs the Senate Special Committee on Investigations, expressed frustration at what he characterized as legal delay tactics that the New Georgia Project used in court and suggested stiffening penalties for campaign finance violations when committed by an organization.
“The candidate had the benefit of $4.2 million spent on her behalf that was illegal,” said Cowsert, who is running for attorney general next year. “And this entity, which is now probably defunct, gets fined by just getting caught at the end after a rope-a-dope, four corners defense, finally coughs up $300,000. And I don’t see where anybody was (held) accountable.”
Individual politicians who run afoul of campaign law can be made to pay fines in addition to repaying ill-gotten or misspent funds. Cowsert suggested codifying similar penalties or even jail time for members of organizations who knowingly violate the law.
“If the worst thing that can happen to you is the illegally obtained contributions you’ve got that hadn’t yet been expended get forfeited to the state, that’s not so bad,” he added. “It’s different if you’re thinking I’ve got to write you a check and pay a personal civil penalty, if you wanna call it that, or a criminal fine, or I might be going to jail.”
Cowsert also mentioned the idea of capping donations to super PACs but indicated that might run afoul of Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United.
Emadi suggested lawmakers could consider granting the ethics commission the power to question people under oath during investigations, which he said would help investigators determine whether campaigns were illegally coordinating with outside groups.
Sen. Harold Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“I think if you can provide the ability to depose individuals in the course of an existing investigation, like a complaint’s been filed – and I want to be very careful. I’m not talking about an ethics commission run amok that can do whatever they want – but if there is an ethics complaint filed and we’re trying to figure out what were they coordinating or maybe there’s a third party complaint, maybe there’s some investigation happening, the ability to question people under oath before we go to a probable cause hearing,” Emadi said.
Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones blasted Thursday’s hearing as political theater.
“As Georgians face health insurance premiums that have doubled and even tripled, the Senate should not be wasting time on political persecutions that have already been fully investigated elsewhere,” the Augusta Democrat said in a statement. “Our focus must be on solving the affordability crisis, the housing crisis and the rapidly rising cost of utilities. Georgians elected us to make their lives easier, not to subject our political opponents to state-funded witch hunts.”
David Emadi, Senate Special Committee on Investigations, Nov. 13, 2025. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Emadi, who was tapped as state ethics chief by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who ran against Abrams twice, said he’s been accused of targeting the New Georgia Project for political purposes. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, he said the ethics commission doesn’t consider politics in its investigations. He gave the example of the Georgia Republican Assembly PAC, which is a right-wing group under investigation for allegedly spending more than $200,000 to influence elections for conservative candidates.
“If it’s a left group, a right group, I don’t really care,” Emadi said. “We’re prosecuting the GRA right now because we have alleged – which is an allegation at this point in the legal process – but we’ve alleged they did the same sort of activity, and I’m comfortable just doing the right thing. It’s not that hard.”

Republican state House and Senate leaders announced late Thursday they will not heed Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s call to return to Raleigh to approve funding to patch a shortfall in the state’s Medicaid budget.
North Carolina health officials, including state Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai, say state lawmakers shorted the Medicaid program by around $319 million for the current fiscal year. In October, Sangvai began implementing Medicaid cuts of 3% to 10% to offset that deficit.
The cuts mean health care providers are receiving less money to care for the 3.1 million North Carolinians enrolled in the program. Primary care doctors, dentists, hospitalizations, community care and nursing homes are all dependent on the program’s funding. A Wake County judge this week put some of the cuts on hold.
On Nov. 6, Stein held a news conference to call an “extra” session, more commonly known as a special session, on Nov. 17. The state constitution gives the governor the power to summon state lawmakers back to Raleigh to deal with emergencies.
At that news conference, Stein said legislators had “failed North Carolina and the people of North Carolina” by not addressing the issue during their October session, which was largely focused on redrawing the state’s congressional districts.
In a joint letter to Stein Thursday, House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said they would not convene a session on Nov. 17, and said Stein’s call for a special session is constitutionally invalid and politically motivated.
They noted that they’re already in session, which makes an extra session a moot point, and added that the constitution only allows the governor to call lawmakers back for “extraordinary” circumstances. They said the Medicaid shortfall does not qualify.
“If circumstances surrounding the Medicaid [shortfall] are in fact extraordinary, it is only in the context of your administration’s failure to address them,” the letter says. “Ultimately, your decision to cut reimbursement rates at a time when sufficient funding exists belongs to your administration alone.”
Republican lawmakers contend that the Medicaid program has enough funding to continue without cuts through April, by which time they say they will have appropriated the additional funding needed to fund it for the rest of the fiscal year. They’re accusing Stein of cutting the program to damage them politically.
Stein and Sangvai say the program is required to have a balanced budget, and cannot operate on the promise of funding at a later time.
Stein responded to the letter on social media late Thursday, calling it the latest example of “dysfunction that has become the norm” for the General Assembly.
“The Republican majority has made the time to damage our democracy with their gerrymander,” Stein wrote. “But when it comes time to protect people’s health care? When it comes time to enact a comprehensive budget? They’re on vacation, and they’ll see us next year.”
Both the House and Senate separately approved plans earlier this fall to patch the shortfall. In the House, one bill would have let the state dip into a reserve fund to delay cuts through the end of the year; another contains just language to fund Medicaid. The Senate’s proposal to fund the program also includes line items for rural health care and the N.C. Children’s hospital, items the House does not agree with. The two chambers have been deadlocked over the issue for months.

(Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)The task of relocating Marcus Whitman’s statue in the Washington state Capitol is becoming a chore.
It’s been challenging to find a place inside where the 11-foot, 9,144-pound bronze statue won’t damage the historic structure. Moving it outside risks exposure to the elements, vandals or both. Either approach would be expensive undertakings.
Leaving the towering Whitman where it stands in the north portico appears increasingly off the table too.
Some state officials envision the foyer as the future home for a statue of Billy Frank Jr., the Nisqually Indian Tribe leader who was an indomitable force in the fight for the protection of salmon and Native American rights. Pairing Frank and Whitman, a doctor and missionary whose role in the displacement of Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest has been scrutinized, is a concern in Indian Country.
Willie Frank III, Frank’s son, has expressed “very strong feelings” about not having it in the same room, said Lt. Gov. Denny Heck at Thursday’s meeting of the State Capitol Committee that’s wrestled with the relocation decision for nearly a year.

So strong, the son offered to display Marcus Whitman at Wa He Lut Indian School at Franks Landing on the Nisqually Reservation, Heck said. But there’s opposition to taking it off campus from those who think both Whitman and Frank should occupy prominent positions at the Capitol, he said.
“We’ve got a lot of different points of view that are being brought here, and I am convinced that that if we deal with one another respectfully, we can get to a point where everybody is going to be comfortable with what we do,” Heck said in the meeting. 
He offered a new possibility: Move the Whitman statue down the hall to a space outside the entrance to the Senate cafeteria room, midway between the offices of the governor and the lieutenant governor.
A structural analysis costing as much as $35,000 must be done to determine if the location could support its massive girth.
Beau Perschbacher, a senior policy adviser to Gov. Bob Ferguson, said he was working with the state Department of Enterprise Services to see if the agency can proceed with existing funds. Otherwise, the Legislature would have to pony up in the 2026 supplemental budget.
Asked if Ferguson has a preferred location for the Whitman statue, Perschbacher replied, “I don’t know if we’ve made a decision on that.”
Decision time
Whitman, who settled near what is today Walla Walla in the 1830s, is one of two Washington figures to have a statue in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. The other is Mother Joseph for whom there is also a statue in the north portico of the state Capitol, across from Whitman.
State lawmakers in 2021 decided to replace the Whitman statue in the U.S. Capitol and another in the state Capitol building with statues of Frank. The Legislature earmarked $100,000 in the current capital budget to relocate the Whitman statue.
Until Thursday, the Capitol Committee had been considering six possible options: moving Whitman outside the south entrance, two variations of putting Whitman and Frank side-by-side, and three different ways with Mother Joseph and Frank side-by-side. 
Costs ranged from $10,000 to more than $200,000 based on the work involved in the moving of statues. The committee was on course to choose an approach in January but won’t now as the latest alternative is studied.
A decision is needed soon because the making of the two bronze statues of Frank is getting underway.
The Washington State Arts Commission has awarded Classic Foundry of Seattle a contract to complete the statues by May 2026.
The current timeline calls for delivery of a statue to the U.S. Capitol in September 2026. That is also seen as the earliest date for installation at the state Capitol, though it could be put in place in early 2027.
On Thursday, representatives from the foundry and the Billy Frank Jr. Statue Committee, including Willie Frank III and artist Haiying Wu, held a press conference to mark the selection of the foundry. It was held at Wa He Lut Indian School, the site of many of the fish-ins for treaty rights organized by Frank, who died in 2014 at the age of 83.
“We have an opportunity to tell the story of Washington — the good, the bad and the ugly — with the story of my father that is wrapped in this project,” said Willie Frank III, in a statement. “It is not the beginning or the end of the story or the work as there is much to do in education, health care, housing and continuing to protect and enhance our treaty rights of fishing, hunting and gathering.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/marcus-whitman-1024x597.png,,,2025-11-13 19:58:12.992749

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)With the federal government shutdown coming to an end, Louisiana has made plans to resume the distribution of food assistance to those in need.
The Louisiana Department of Health said Thursday it will distribute 100% of federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to eligible recipients who haven’t received their November benefits stating next week. For those who received 65% of their assistance during the shutdown, they will get the remaining 35% next week.
The Landry administration reallocated health department money to make up for the loss of SNAP benefits at the start of November, when there was no end in sight to the federal government shutdown that had begun Oct. 1. The state set up a schedule to distribute 25% of benefits per week, prioritizing the elderly and disabled who typically get their funds early in the month. Anyone who received the one-fourth portion of state-funded assistance from Nov. 1-4 will keep that amount and receive the rest of their benefits this month, the health department said.
SNAP recipients will receive their benefits on their usual distribution day of the month, based on the last digit of the head of household’s Social Security number.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of the Iowa Board of Regents called Thursday for further study of academic programs and their value when it comes to workforce alignment, enrollment and social good after receiving a report diving into such topics.
Board staff, with the help of internal and external partners and resources, developed a report on workforce alignment of academic programs after a February directive from Board President Sherry Bates. While the huge amount of data and information compiled in the report didn’t answer all of her questions, Board Chief Academic Officer Rachel Boon said it is helping her ask better ones.
Boon and Associate Chief Academic Officer Jason Pontius presented the report to the regents Thursday. Conversations are happening across the U.S. about the value of a college degree, its cost and the relationship between college and community, Boon said, but it’s important to measure those concerns against data applicable to Iowa.
“Much of what we see and hear in the discourse is based on national data,” Boon said. “So this is an opportunity for us to really not dismiss those claims, but really interrogate them locally and look at our own data and see what we can learn about our own context.”

However, efforts by institutions to consider the return on investment of their own academic programs are being made across the U.S. as well, a fact Boon said was helpful in the creation of this report.
Using data from universities, U.S. Department of Education, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Iowa Workforce Development and the American Community Survey, the team connected academic programs to industries and their outcomes and calculated how long it would take students to get a return on their investment, Pontius said.
Other organizations and universities have developed methods of calculating the return on investment for students earning a certain degree, Pontius said, which the board team adapted to their own needs.
“We’re not making up our own formula process,” Pontias said. “We’re just adopting what other folks have used, and then we’re working really hard to make direct connections between our university graduates and the workforce data sources that we have available.”
The group calculated break-even thresholds, described in the report as a way of determining how long it would take for a degree holder to earn more than a non-degree holder in the same job, for programs, factoring in the time and cost of education as well as debt.
Pontius said 75% of majors at Iowa’s public universities would “break even” within three years compared to someone who started working right out of high school, and more popular programs shrink that time.
Taking on enrollment was a “smaller lift” for the team than looking at return on investment, Boon said, but there are factors like demand, student interest and aptitude, accreditation caps and general education requirements to consider when scrutinizing enrollment in certain programs. Some degrees may be more popular as secondary majors rather than main areas of study, and certain areas might have a low workforce demand but still need experts in the field.
The report stated universities determined that “low enrollment thresholds” for academic programs would be 25 or fewer students in undergraduate programs and 10 or fewer students in graduate programs.
The University of Northern Iowa had the most undergraduate classes come in underneath the enrollment threshold at 17, Boon said, two of which are new programs. The University of Iowa had 13 programs under the threshold, two with enrollment caps from accreditors, and Iowa State University had 12, four of which were identified as second-major only.
As for graduate programs, ISU had 35 under the threshold, two of which are new. Two of the 16 UI programs identified in the report as not meeting the threshold are also new, and UNI is phasing out two of the 12 programs the report listed.
Recommendations call for expanded use of data
Recommendations from the study team were split into categories based on their relation to workforce alignment, enrollment and data.
As the dashboard created for the report is “pretty dense,” Boon said, the report recommends taking aspects of it, like the break-even calculation, and adding them to existing dashboards available to the public. The report also recommends that universities find “data-informed strategies “to support students in connecting degree tracks and various opportunities for experiential learning to their career objectives.”
When looking at enrollment, the report stated the review process the board uses to scrutinize academic programs should include information on low enrollment thresholds in addition to other facts.
Universities should create “a framework or index for program vitality that factors in enrollment as well as issues such as, but not limited to, licensure or accreditation requirements, service to other areas of study … and faculty resources,” the report stated. The institutions should also find opportunities to change or close programs “that would generate administrative efficiencies, improve academic program alignments, or create enhanced opportunities for workforce preparation.”
ISU associate professor Annemarie Butler, the only person to speak during public comment Wednesday, encouraged the regents to accept and implement the report’s recommendations but warned that the data could be misleading as to how important and necessary certain programs are.
“Please honor the recommendation to empower each university to conduct holistic reviews of their low enrollment majors in light of the wide variety of considerations identified in the report,” Butler said. “Our public universities’ curricula are interdependent and not neatly parceled into independent departmental silos.”
Pontius and Boon acknowledged Thursday that there are gaps in the data, due to their rule of only using publicly available data and the limitations of some of the data they did use. Boon said she’d like to have more time to fill these gaps with supplemental data and work with others trying to evaluate their own programs to find solutions, and it is recommended in the report.
Other recommendations include continued review of the assignment of codes meant to track academic programs to “reduce variance” in how codes are assigned — a task Boon said universities are already working on — and encouraging improved data collection by Iowa Workforce Development to include the actual jobs graduates are taking rather than just the industries they’re going into.
Further study, discussion planned
After receiving the report, board members questioned what next steps were to be, including eliminating degree programs. Regents Robert Cramer and Christine Hensley said higher education stakeholders, including legislators, are waiting to see what comes after the information is gathered.
“In some of the conversations I’ve had with legislators, I think there’s a feeling that there should be specific recommendations as to which programs and/or majors should be eliminated,” Hensley said.
Regent Kurt Tjaden suggested hearing directly from university officials about the report and the threshold calculations in it at the board’s February meeting, adding that knowing the university perspective will help when answering lawmakers’ questions.
Boon said the team could do even more with the report ahead of the February meeting, like “cross hatch” workforce alignment data with program enrollment data to see which low-enrollment programs have a high return on investment — a “complex” task that they didn’t have time to complete.
Another area the study group, as well as colleges in Florida and Arizona, is trying to figure out is how to measure social and community impacts of degree programs. This would be a factor in determining return on investment for areas like teaching, social work, community and behavioral health, Boon said, and other fields where wage outcomes might not reflect the necessity of their work. It was also the final recommendation of the report.
“We haven’t cracked that nut yet, but we want to,” Boon said. “So I’d love, a year from now, if we could come and tell you about the really exciting new index we have on social and community impact of our majors, that would be a really powerful outcome to me.”

SNAP uncertainty spiking demand at Idaho food banks

Amid the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare had paused November benefits for the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Two court challenges against the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision not to use contingency funding to keep the program running during the shutdown resulted in a USDA directive for states to issue at least partial payments. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare began providing partial payments on Nov. 7, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
The U.S. House on Wednesday night approved a stopgap funding bill that President Donald Trump then signed to end the government shutdown. 
More than 130,000 Idahoans use the program that helps low-income Americans pay for groceries. The average monthly benefit is $178 per household member. 
 Implementation of SNAP’s expanded work requirements delayed by shutdown 

Additional work requirements for SNAP recipients included in the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” were supposed to go into effect Nov. 1. However, with disruptions from the shutdown, states were told to prioritize funding for SNAP benefits administration, Idaho Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in an email. 
“Idaho is currently working to implement the changes in work program requirements now that states will begin receiving full funding,” McWhorter said Thursday.
According to a USDA memo sent to states on Oct. 3, the changes are to the exceptions for the three-month time limit for able-bodied adults without dependents to use SNAP.  
New work rules could deny food stamps to thousands of veterans


Able bodied adults without dependents up to age 64 will need to show they are working or eligible for another exemption to be able to access benefits for more than three months. The previous upper age limit for this time limit requirement was 54, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 


Previous exemptions for veterans, those experiencing homelessness or youth aging out of foster care will be removed.  
The time limit exemption for caregivers of children under the age of 18 has been narrowed to those with children under age 14. 
A new exception for the time limit was created for Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and tribal members. 

For states to waive the work requirements, they must now show an unemployment rate over 10%, with exceptions for Alaska and Hawaii. The prior waiver allowed states to identify areas that lack sufficient jobs.

U.S. attorney for Wyoming says detrimental effects of marijuana are ""undeniable"" and he will ""rigorously"" enforce the law.
The post Marijuana users upset Trump will harsh their national park mellow, prosecute for possession appeared first on WyoFile .","National Park rangers will start “rigorously” enforcing statutes outlawing simple possession of marijuana in Wyoming’s federal reserves, reversing a Biden-era policy, Wyoming’s U.S. Attorney Darin Smith announced Thursday.
“Marijuana possession remains a federal crime in the United States, irrespective of varying state laws,” Smith said in a statement. Enforcement will be rigorous on federal land, “such as national parks,” Smith’s statement reads.
Cannabis carries dangers, he told WyoFile through a spokesperson.
“This administration thinks that marijuana use is a public safety hazard and this office is going to uphold the law and ensure safety and security of the public within our jurisdiction,” Smith said.
The announcement harshed the mellow of several marijuana users who told WyoFile they have enjoyed smoking pot while visiting the parks. One said she would continue to partake.
“I definitely think it’s absurd,” said Alice Wise, who asked WyoFile to identify her with that pseudonym for fear of prosecution or harassment. She said smoking marijuana in national parks has enhanced her experiences.
“National Parks are reserved for recreation. Why add more restrictions to our public lands?” John Dough
“Nothing would stop me,” not even the new directive, the Wyoming resident said.
A memo from the Department of Justice last month prompted Attorney Smith’s announcement, said Lori Hogan, a spokesperson for his office. The new enforcement reverses an effective non-prosecution policy put in place by President Biden in 2022.
Biden’s pardon
On Oct. 6 of that year, Biden pardoned people convicted or charged federally with simple possession. The pardons applied to more than 6,000 people, according to an analysis by Theodore M. Shaw, a law professor at the University of North Carolina’s Center for Civil Rights.
The pardons effectively decriminalized simple possession or use of marijuana on federal lands, according to a commentary by John Hudak on the Brookings Institution website. Even if a federal prosecutor in the Biden administration had chosen to charge somebody for simple possession, “it would be a waste of his department’s time and resources to pursue charges that a president will ultimately pardon,” Hudak wrote.
What effect the new DOJ prosecution policy will have on illicit pot smoking in parks is uncertain.
“National Parks are reserved for recreation, for the benefit and enjoyment of the American people,” said a Jackson Hole marijuana user who asked to be identified by the pseudonym John Dough for fear of prosecution or harassment. “Why add more restrictions to our public lands?”
He quoted a John Prine lyric from the song Illegal Smile; “I didn’t kill anyone, I’m just trying to have me some fun.”
“It’s really none of the government’s business,” said Dough, who said he has been smoking pot in parks for 50 years. “I think it’s unfortunate we’re backtracking on that.”
Marijuana user Wise said attitudes regarding marijuana and other controlled substances are changing.
“The whole world has woken up about marijuana and many other consciousness-changing substances that are found to be useful,” she said. “It seems like the current administration just wants to remove every pleasure.”
Biden curtailed prosecution
Biden’s pardons “significantly curtailed” federal prosecutions of misdemeanor marijuana offenses, Smith’s office said in a release. But spokesperson Hogan said it would be difficult to determine whether incidents involving marijuana — such as impaired driving — are increasing.
“We don’t typically keep stats on that kind of stuff,” she said. “There are so many different codes that falls under, it’s really hard to query that kind of information in our system.”
Wyoming has not made marijuana possession legal like some other states. Montana, where part of Yellowstone National Park is located, has decriminalized cannabis. Pot shops are located within about a 20-minute drive of the park’s border.
According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, along with heroin, LSD, ecstasy, peyote and others. 
“The detrimental effects of drugs on our society are undeniable,” Smith’s statement reads, “and I am committed to using every prosecutorial tool available to hold offenders accountable.”
Biden “directed U.S. Attorneys not to prosecute those offenses,” the announcement from Smith’s office said. Hudak’s commentary, however, said that Biden was careful not to direct then-Attorney General Merrick Garland.
“The president has publicly noted a desire for the Justice Department to be independent and buffered from political puppeteering,” Hudak wrote.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-14 00:01:07+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT legislature votes to limit ICE arrests in courthouses, enhance data protections",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/13/ct-legislature-special-session-immigration/,Immigrant advocates who supported the bill said it addressed their concerns about federal agencies' access to immigrants' personal data.,"State lawmakers passed a bill, largely on party lines, limiting the actions U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can take at courthouses and prohibiting state agencies from widely sharing state residents’ personal information. 
Under House Bill 8004, state agencies are banned from sharing personal information like home addresses, workplaces or dates and times of court hearings and appointments. The bill will also codify a policy first enacted by Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins in September, which forbids ICE agents from making arrests inside state courthouses without a judicial warrant. The bill also prohibits law enforcement agents from wearing masks on courthouse grounds “unless medically necessary.” 
Immigrant advocates who supported the bill said it addressed their concerns about federal agencies’ access to immigrants’ personal data but didn’t entirely resolve their anxieties about the recent surge in immigrant detentions. 
Camila Bortolleto, a steering committee member with the advocacy group HUSKY for Immigrants, stood with a handful of people at the Capitol on Wednesday holding signs representing immigrants who had been detained by ICE in Danbury — many at the courthouse.
“ If Connecticut had passed this policy a couple months ago, these folks likely will not have been arrested by ICE,” Bortolleto said.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said Thursday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had asked ICE to identify themselves after a series of people were found to have been impersonating ICE officers. The purpose of the immigration provisions in H.B. 8004, he said, was to ensure that people felt safe at courthouses and that the courthouses could operate efficiently. 
“ It’s not about our feelings about police, our feelings about ICE. It’s about the people who are interfacing with our court system,” he said. 
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, echoed Winfield in a debate in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night. 
“We’ve all seen the videos. It’s hard not to see the videos of folks being tackled, roughed up, windows being broken when court is in session,” Stafstrom said. 
“When folks are walking into our courthouse, many of whom are not there as criminal defendants, many of whom are there as victims of crime, many of them are there as witnesses to crime. Many of them are there for divorce proceedings or to get a restraining order or to fight an abusive creditor or to seek justice in a landlord-tenant situation. That’s the majority of folks in our courthouse on a day in day basis,” Stafstrom said. 
But Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, questioned whether the ban on courthouse arrests would have any meaningful effect. The bill prevents ICE from arresting people for civil violations, but Fishbein said that entering the U.S. illegally, as well as failing to register with the federal government, is considered a criminal offense. 
Chris Llinas, an immigration attorney with offices in Hartford and Portland, told the Connecticut Mirror that Fishbein’s interpretation of the law was incorrect. 
“Unlawful presence in the U.S. — overstaying a visa, lacking valid status, being in removal proceedings, etc. — is a civil immigration violation, not a crime,” said Llinas. “Most people ICE targets at courthouses are subject only to civil enforcement.” 
Llinas said the bill would prevent ICE from arresting people who had overstayed their visas, people without legal status who had no criminal records, immigrants in removal proceedings, asylum seekers and people who were going to the courthouse as victims or as witnesses. 
Republicans in the Senate said they were concerned that lax rules would allow immigrants who committed violent crimes to avoid deportation. 
Sen. Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he disagreed with the idea of stopping ICE from making arrests in courthouses. “ You’re protecting criminals. In many cases, the individuals that are going to the courthouse are facing charges, in some cases violent crime,” Harding said. “And you’re telling me that we’re going to keep these individuals in the country and keep ICE away from there. I mean, what logical policy is that?” 
Bortolleto, of HUSKY for Immigrants, said her group was most concerned about data being shared by the Department of Motor Vehicles — since many immigrants hold drive-only licenses — and from the Department of Social Services, which provides health insurance for children and pregnant women without legal status. 
On Thursday afternoon, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, raised two amendments proposing changes to Connecticut’s Trust Act, which dictates the circumstances under which local law enforcement can cooperate with ICE. 
Under the current Trust Act, law enforcement can only turn someone over to ICE if the agency presents a judicial warrant or if the individual has been convicted of a high-level felony. Fazio’s amendments would have expanded the exception to include all felonies or to those who had been either arrested or convicted for a high-level felony. 
“These individuals who are convicted of serious crimes are being protected in the state of Connecticut,” said Fazio. 
Both amendments failed on a party-line vote. 
While lawmakers debated changes to state law, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong filed a joint amicus brief, with 18 other states, in a case against the Trump administration that’s proceeding through federal immigration court. The case challenges the Trump administration’s new policies on expedited deportations, which allow immigration officers to deport people who enter the country illegally without first giving them the opportunity to appear before a judge. 
Formerly applicable only to immigrants who had entered the U.S. without inspection and were captured by law enforcement within two weeks of their arrival and 100 miles of the border, the Trump administration now has expanded that policy to include people who enter the U.S. without inspection who are detained anywhere in the U.S. and within two years of their arrival. 
The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia paused the new policy this summer, saying it fails to give due process to people who may have been in the U.S. for an extended period of time, and it risks wrongful deportations.   
Bortolleto said there were other proposals immigration advocates wanted that hadn’t made it into the bill, like allowing people to attend court hearings remotely and a commitment that the state will not use the National Guard for immigration enforcement. She also wants the state to fund health insurance through HUSKY for refugees, asylees, and other legally present immigrants who will lose eligibility for federally funded health insurance in October 2026. 
Carmen Lanche, executive director of Comunidades Sin Fronteras, told CT Mirror that there were immigrants who were afraid to go to court. She said that children didn’t want to go to school out of fear that they wouldn’t see their parents again. 
“We don’t want to live in fear. We don’t want our children, who are the future of this country, to grow up with trauma, because childhood traumas are carried into adulthood,” Lanche said. “We want children to be happy, healthy and to continue studying, and to not worry about these things that don’t have to happen.” 
H.B. 8004 was taken up in a 2-day special session this week along with three other bills addressing housing, hospitals and an emergency state funding reserve. 
The bill also carried a hodgepodge of other provisions, including an added 5-cent charge on phone bills for a fund for firefighters diagnosed with cancer. Republicans said they wanted to support the cancer fund but argued that it should be funded through the state budget rather than through a tax. 
Additionally, the bill contained provisions pertaining to behavioral health services, including a requirement that insurers cover autism services for young adults up to age 26, a study to examine and identify gaps in programs available for children’s mental health, and another study of a Yale program for children with intensive mental health needs. 
The bill passed the House 96-48 and passed the Senate 27-8, with three Republican Senators joining the Democrats Thursday evening. It heads now to the governor’s desk.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1113_SR_SpecialSession_011-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 19:58:12.992749

Fire ignites at Glenrock power plant after power outage hits multiple parts of the state, official says.
The post Tripped power lines cut electricity to 95,000 Wyoming customers appeared first on WyoFile .","A multistate power outage Thursday left as many as 95,000 customers in Wyoming without electricity, according to some reports, and may have caused a fire at the Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant near Glenrock. 
The outages affected more than 10% of Wyoming customers and extended into portions of western South Dakota, according to reports.
“We believe the outage, which began around 12:45 p.m., was triggered by two tripped 500-kilovolt lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming,” Western Area Power Administration Public Affairs Specialist Stephen J. Collier said in a statement. “This incident resulted in an abnormal voltage event that subsequently tripped a number of surrounding lines, including WAPA transmission, resulting in further power outages to communities across the area.”
By 4:30 p.m., electricity was restored to about half of the affected customers, according to PowerOutage.us. But officials warned that power delivery could remain unstable.
Authorities were searching for correlations between the events, according to Wyoming Department of Homeland Security Director Lynn Budd, while utility workers were gradually restoring power to impacted communities around the state. 
The widespread outage was highly unusual, because it affected several different electrical utility providers, including Rocky Mountain Power, Black Hills Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities customers. The affected utilities share an interconnected grid.
The fire at Dave Johnston started after the power outage, Budd said. The agency reiterated that because the Dave Johnston power plant fire happened after the power outage, the fire was a “possible consequence of the power outage, not the cause.”

Outages were reported in Gillette, Casper, Douglas, Newcastle and Sheridan, among other communities in Wyoming. Natrona County took the biggest hit, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks electricity disruptions. 
Rocky Mountain Power reported 55 outages in Wyoming affecting 56,776 customers around 2 p.m.
Powder River Energy Corporation, which serves Campbell, Crook, Johnson, Sheridan and Weston counties, reported 26,544 customers experiencing outages.
Intermittent outages persisted in some Wyoming communities throughout Thursday afternoon. 
“Bottom line, members should be prepared for an extended outage through the night. The voltages coming into our system are unstable and are tripping off power,” Powder River Energy Corporation wrote on its Facebook page shortly after 3:30 p.m. Thursday. “That’s why some are seeing ‘lights on, lights off’. We have crews staged at almost every substation to begin safe restoration of power once the voltages stabilize. However, we do not want to flip the switches unsafely. We do not want to blow up transformers or arrestors and cause more problems.”

In Gillette, the city government reported a community-wide outage at 12:40 p.m. An hour later, the city posted on its Facebook page that power had been restored. Things changed again 40 minutes later.
“As of approximately 2:20 p.m., all of the City is out of service again,” an updated post read. “We are being affected by a widespread regional outage and do not have an expected return to service at this time.”
The outage in Casper appeared city-wide, the police department there reported. The agency directed people who were dependent on oxygen and in need of electricity to two locations in the city. 
Natrona County’s library and YMCA closed early due to the outages, and several local businesses reported the same. The Natrona County School District canceled all after-school activities, according to a text sent to parents.
Some businesses, including a liquor store, in Glenrock — just a few miles from the Dave Johnston plant — posted written signs that they were temporarily closed due to the power outages. Non-essential Natrona County offices closed for the remainder of the business day. The city of Casper announced that a number of its facilities — including City Hall, Casper Recreation Center, Casper Ice Arena, Casper Family Aquatic Center, and Fort Casper — closed early and would not reopen until Friday due to the unstable electricity.
Suggested safety precautions
Treat all downed power lines as live and extremely dangerous. Stay away and report them immediately to 911 and your local utility provider. 

Conserve cell phone battery: Limit non-essential calls and use text messaging where possible. Utilize cell phone carriers or public safety radio for emergency communication. 
Use generators safely: If operating a portable generator, NEVER run it inside a home, garage, or any enclosed space. Ensure proper ventilation to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. 
Check on neighbors: Check on vulnerable family members, neighbors, and friends, particularly the elderly or those dependent on electricity for medical equipment. 
Use alternate facilities: Residents who are oxygen-dependent or require power for life-sustaining medical equipment and do not have backup power are encouraged to contact their local emergency management office or visit designated facilities. 
Avoid overloading circuits: Once power is restored, gradually turn on appliances to prevent overloading the local circuits.

But they show no significant gains, either.
Since 2021-22, the first year of student data after the pandemic, the share of students passing the assessment — including the initial test and any retest — has hovered around 85%.
The Mississippi Department of Education announced Thursday that data point holds true for the 2024-25 school year, with 85% of the state’s third graders ultimately passing the reading assessment required to graduate to the next grade, just barely higher than last year’s rate of 84%.
The new pass rate remains lower than in 2018-19, when it was 85.6%. 
It’s the latest chapter in Mississippi’s national reading success story, called a “miracle” by some but, more recently, a “marathon” by state education leaders. Over the past decade, the percentage of the state’s fourth graders scoring advanced or proficient on the National Assessment of Educational Progress — or The Nation’s Report Card — has skyrocketed, with Mississippi going from last in the nation to ninth. NAEP is separate from the state assessment.
Researchers, educators and lawmakers largely attribute that progress to the Literacy-Based Promotion Act of 2013. The law funneled money and targeted curriculum toward improving literacy outcomes, and famously established a third-grade reading test.
Students have three tries to score at least a 3 or higher on the reading portion of the state’s English Language Arts assessment to move to fourth grade. Students can score up to 5, which is considered advanced. 
The latest results show 13.9% of Mississippi third graders scored a 5, while 35.5% scored a 4 and 26.3% scored a 3. About a quarter of students did not pass the assessment.
The initial administration of the test in the spring resulted in a record pass rate of 77.3%. Students who don’t pass get another try in May, and a final attempt in June. If they’re still unsuccessful after the third attempt, they’re held back in third grade, unless they have a district-determined exemption — they have certain learning disabilities, they are learning English or they were previously retained. 
Students with disabilities who were previously retained or received two years of intensive remediation accounted for about a half of the “good cause” exemptions for 2024-25. Another third were promoted because they were tested using an alternative assessment.  
Over 2,132 third-graders, or 6%, were held back.
“Educators and teachers across Mississippi understand the importance of ensuring young students have a solid literacy foundation,” State Superintendent of Education Lance Evans said in a statement. “We also applaud every teacher, administrator, literacy coach, parent and student for their hard work in achieving literacy success.”
The state education agency said in a press release that over the past year, in an attempt to raise literacy outcomes, it provided training from literacy coaches to certain schools, expanded professional development opportunities, encouraged the usage of “high-quality instructional materials” and helped integrate Science of Reading teaching for educators-in-training.
The department said at a Senate hearing this fall that it hopes to expand the reading act into grades 4 through 8. Data show that despite the major reading gains among younger students, that success hasn’t translated into higher grades.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/06161248/serena-venus-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)A number of changes to K-12 school policy and funding are included in Pennsylvania’s 2025-2026 budget. 
Primarily, they’re based around increasing oversight of cyber charter schools, increasing the amount of money doled out through the state’s adequacy formula and recruiting and retaining teachers as the commonwealth faces a shortage.
While most policy shifts are relatively small, public education advocates have called the budget a positive step in the right direction.
“While the delayed budget makes planning and operations difficult for public schools, this agreement demonstrates what’s possible when our leaders prioritize students and work together to meet Pennsylvania’s constitutional duty to provide a ‘thorough and efficient’ public education system,” said a statement from PA Schools Work, a coalition of organizations that have advocated for Pennsylvania public schools.

Cyber Charter funding and oversight
Some of the biggest education policy changes in the budget revolve around cyber charters, which are privately operated and paid for with tax dollars that students can attend remotely via webcam.
Cyber charters have come under intense scrutiny in Pennsylvania by officials from both parties. A February report by GOP state Auditor General Tim DeFoor looking at five cyber charters found they were raising large amounts of money and spending it in ways that didn’t seem tied to educational outcomes or opportunities.
Generally, tuition for cyber charter schools comes from the public school districts where the students resides. This remains the case, but public schools will now be able to deduct a greater amount from the total they would have had to pay per student.
The legislature estimates savings for public school districts will be around $178 million statewide.
The move was a compromise with mostly Democratic lawmakers and Gov. Josh Shapiro, who had called to cap cyber charter tuition at $8,000 per student.
”It’s a step in the right direction, and it is a very welcome step,” said Susan Spicka, the executive director of Education Voters PA, who has been a longtime advocate for cyber charter reform.
A number of policies will also be instituted with the intent of adding accountability for cyber charters.
One is an attempt to reign in truancy at the largely remote schools. A new policy will bar public school students with high truancy rates from transferring to cyber charters, unless a judge decides it’s in their best interest.
Students will also be required to be visible on webcam during synchronous instruction — real-time lessons — in order to be marked in attendance.

Cyber charters will also be required to conduct mandatory weekly wellness checks on students. Teachers will also be required to undergo training in recognizing signs of child abuse.
The moves follow the death of one cyber charter student following severe abuse at home, signs of which were not reported by teachers. That led the students’ family to file a wrongful death lawsuit against her school.
The budget also institutes a policy that’s intended to make it easier for public school districts to dispute paying cyber charter tuition for students who are no longer residents.
House Education Chair Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh) says the move came in response to reports that public school districts faced an onerous process for disputing tuition payments for students that moved during the school year.
“The goal isn’t to beat up on the cyber schools,” Schweyer said of the reforms. “It’s to make sure the students are learning and the tax payers are getting what they’re paying for in all this.”
Tweaking the adequacy formula
Last year,  lawmakers created a new adequacy formula for doling money to the state’s least funded school districts. That was in response to a Commonwealth Court ruling that found the state’s public school funding scheme had been unconstitutionally inequitable.
By and large, the adequacy formula, which takes into account factors like district poverty levels and the number of students learning English as a second language, remains the same this year. However, more than $500 million  in additional dollars will be distributed through it.
Most of the funding was part of a planned step up from last year. When lawmakers created the formula, they had planned to increase spending through it annually until the total reaches around $4.5 billion after nine years.
Yet despite early pushback from some Republicans, who said they felt too much money was being distributed to a school system with dwindling enrollment numbers, the budget that passed will dole out even more money through the adequacy formula than what Gov. Josh Shapiro had asked for in his February budget address.
That’s because lawmakers instituted a $50,000 minimum distribution for all school districts, meaning even districts that would have otherwise received no money through the adequacy formula will now receive the $50,000 each.

More than 130 of the 500 public school districts will receive the minimum amount this year.
“We recognize that all school districts have some sort of additional needs, so we put a minimum funding balance of $50,000 for all school districts,” Schweyer said. “None of that hurts any school districts, in fact it makes sure that all school districts are in a good space.”
The move to increase funding through the adequacy formula, which faced an uncertain future during the months-long negotiation over the budget, was hailed by public school advocates.
“With this budget, lawmakers affirmed that the Commonwealth remains on the path toward a fully and fairly funded public education system,” read a joint statement from the Education Law Center and Public Interest Law Center, two nonprofits that were involved in the lawsuit that led to the creation of the adequacy formula. “This is another step forward – one that must be followed by continued commitment and sustained investment until every student, in every community, has the resources they need to learn and thrive.”
Teacher recruitment and retention
The budget also institutes policies aimed at helping Pennsylvania schools recruit and retain teachers.
Currently, the state  faces a teacher shortage, with a high number leaving the industry and a dwindling number of people entering it.
Policies implemented by the new budget are intended to make it easier for new teachers to enter the profession, including those coming from nontraditional backgrounds.
One of those, long sought by the Pennsylvania State Education Association, increases funding for student teacher stipends, which allows the state to pay student teachers for the time they spend in classrooms working towards their certifications.
Another new policy allows  districts to hire teachers with lapsed certifications while working with them to help them re-certify.
According to Schweyer, this policy is aimed at making it easier for former teachers who left the field to care for families or pursue other careers get back into the classroom.
The budget also creates what’s called an experience-based teaching certificate, which is intended to fast track the certification process for professionals who want to transition into teaching in fields related to their work.

For example, a school district could hire a professional chemist as a high school science teacher. They would then get an experience-based teaching certificate and have five years to complete their practicum while working as a teacher.
Other changes include a mandatory shift towards what’s called evidence-based literacy education for teachers working with young children on reading skills.
Students in kindergarten through third grade will also be screened for reading ability three times a year. If a student’s reading skills are found to be deficient, their parents will be notified. All schools will also be required to report to the Department of Education annually on their students’ progress.
The budget also includes a policy that expands the number of grades that a teacher can be certified to teach at any given time.
$125 million will also be set aside for school facility repairs, including at least $25 million for the Solar for Schools program, as well as $100 million for school safety and mental health grants.
It will also become a requirement for graduating students to enroll in FAFSA, which is intended to encourage more students to apply for colleges, unless they choose to opt out.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)BOZEMAN —Scattered across a couple tables at Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Region 3 Headquarters on Wednesday night, were the decapitated heads of several deer.
Those attending the event, aimed at teaching the public about Chronic Wasting Disease, got expert instruction on how to remove lymph nodes from an animal, which are then sent to a lab for testing. Chronic Wasting Disease, often abbreviated as “CWD,” is a neurological disease that elk, deer and moose can be infected with.
It is not a virus nor a bacteria, but a transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Basically, a naturally occurring protein, called a prion, becomes misfolded and is not broken down by the animal the way it should be. Prions can be spread through contact, feces, and other bodily fluids. Soil that has been contaminated with any of those fluids can also infect other animals.
CWD is always fatal to the creature and they may carry and spread the disease long before they show symptoms. Those symptoms can sometimes be similar to other animal diseases and there isn’t a cure. There’s also never been a confirmed case of CWD transmission to humans.
It’s one of the main wild animal diseases the state is investing significant time, money and staffing into.
“We have to respond pretty rapidly when we get a first detection, because it’s probably been there for a while,” FWP wildlife biologist Bevin McCormick said. “So that is a really big challenge.”
Meat from animals testing positive for CWD should not be eaten and part of Wednesday’s event was to show how easy the process of removing lymph nodes was. Following a demonstration from agency staffer Jasmine Allison, those in attendance were given a head, gloves and a scalpel.
Montana State freshman Candace Ashworth, who said she came to the event because she’s curious about animal diseases and it fits within her classwork, thought the experience was pretty cool.
“I’ve done dissections for anatomy classes before in high school,” Ashworth said. “And I’m like, this is totally different, and something that I can actually use later in life. I go hunting. This is super important and I didn’t know how to figure out what they sample.”
The process is not particularly difficult — which staff in attendance stressed — but there are a few things that help. First and foremost, if you bring a head to any of FWP’s facilities, they’ll get the glands out for you. Some people prefer mailing in the samples, which is also an option.

It can take a few days for outlying offices to get a result back, staff said, though the FWP headquarters facility is across the street from where they test samples, meaning turnaround time is quick there.
It’s hard to tell if an animal is outwardly sick, so FWP stresses to always get an animal tested.
Not everyone does, though but Allison said the little bit of time out of the day is worth knowing.
“Even if you did the whole process with us at one of our stations, 15 minutes, max,” she said.
One of the biggest things hunters can do to help is to make sure they leave a few inches of neck, as this makes it easier to recover the glands. The lymph nodes will also feel very different than the surrounding tissue, Allison said. 
Chronic Wasting Disease is a rising issue in Montana, with the first confirmed case coming in from a deer in 2017. Since that point, the state has undertaken a significant surveillance effort, though work in-state tracking the disease goes back to 1998.
Beyond the disease testing service, a CWD annual report is generated each year by the agency and maps documenting where the disease has been found are updated frequently.

During the 2024-25 hunting season, the state tested just less than 10,000 deer, elk and moose for CWD.
“Of these, 356 animals tested positive for CWD, including 128 mule deer, 222 white-tailed deer, and 6 elk,” the 2024 CWD annual report states.
The report goes on to say the disease has been found in 30% of Montana hunting districts. Seven new districts reported CWD cases last year, the report said, and other districts reported new species getting the disease.
“The geographic distribution of CWD continues to expand and prevalences continue to increase statewide,” the report states. 
Some areas of the state are also designated as CWD hotspots (called priority sampling areas) as well as a CWD Management Zone around Libby where the disease is more common.
Management hunts are one strategy that’s been tried around Libby, which the annual report says is being considered for hotspots in southwest Montana. Many of the hotspots are around major interstates, meaning there could be some degree of humans moving around the disease. That’s FWP suggests discarding anything from the animal in a class 2 landfill — prions can enter the water table and stay there for years. 
“FWP continues to plan for long-term CWD management in positive areas,” the report reads.
Importantly, CWD does not appear to be a major threat to cattle, though there are other diseases stemming from wild animals that are. A 10-year University of Wyoming study published in 2018 concluded that, “the risks of CWD transmission to cattle following oral inoculation or after prolonged exposure to contaminated environments are low.”
  CSKT awaiting confirmation on CWD test 

Tribal authorities said Thursday that a second case of CWD was awaiting confirmation from a white-tailed deer harvested on the Flathead Indian Reservation.
CSKT’s Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Recreation and Conservation is awaiting the results of the test from a second laboratory. A confirmed positive result was found in January, a tribal press release said.
“Our goal is to protect the community and prevent further spreading within our Reservation,” Rich Janssen, Natural Resources Department Head said in a release. “Tribal hunters need to be testing their harvests.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FWP3-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

Tim Walz speaks during a visit to Pine Bend Elementary School in Inver Grove Heights for a meeting of the Children's Cabinet Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz boasted about Minnesota’s education system to a Texas audience on Thursday. He said Minnesota’s graduation rates are improving, free school meals set students up for success and universal pre-kindergarten education gives students a leg-up.
But Minnesota doesn’t have universal pre-K. On top of that, child care in Minnesota is among the most expensive in the nation.
Walz made the incorrect assertion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, where he spoke for nearly an hour. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor governor, who is running for an unprecedented third, four-year term, was invited to the annual event to discuss his vice presidential run last year and the national political scene.
Walz was asked how he would advise Texans to improve educational outcomes for pre-K through 12th grade students. He said first, defend public schools. Then he went into all the ways Minnesota’s education system is superior to other states.
“We got better achievement. We have less truancy and better graduation rates. We made sure that students were secure in their persons. They were secure in their food. They were secure at home with that Child Tax Credit,” Walz said.
“… And then in Minnesota, we have universal pre-K for everyone, so students come ready to do what they need to do,” he said.
Minnesota lawmakers in recent years have taken steps to open up more free, voluntary pre-kindergarten seats, but it’s far from enough to cover all pre-K students.
The Legislature last year agreed to fund another 5,200 seats by fiscal year 2026 in the state’s voluntary pre-k program that provides free school for 4-year-olds. Minnesota will soon have a total of 12,360 slots available statewide.
The state has two preschool programs — voluntary prekindergarten and school readiness plus. Children from low-income families can also enroll in Head Start — which is mostly federally funded. Head Start programs serve about 12,500 students in the state. Parents can also apply for early learning scholarships.
The National Institute for Early Education Research last year released a report that found during  the 2022-2023 school year, Minnesota served 11% of 4-year-olds and 1% of 3-year-olds in state-funded preschool. The nonprofit ranked Minnesota 37th in the nation for preschool enrollment. About half of 3- and 4-year-olds attend some kind of preschool.
Walz touted Minnesota’s “better achievement,” but academic outcomes for Minnesota students have stagnated since the pandemic in both reading and math. A Reformer analysis of test scores from 2019 to 2025 found that less than 1 in 8 Minnesota school districts have returned to pre-pandemic proficiency rates in either subject, mirroring national trends.
Walz is right about high school graduation, however. Just over 84% percent of Minnesota’s high school seniors graduated in 2024, MPR reported in May. That’s Minnesota’s highest rate ever.
Walz at the Texas Tribune Festival reminisced about his brief glimpse of national fame on the campaign trail last year as then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. He also touted the DFL trifecta’s wins in 2023, including codifying abortion rights, free college for students from low-income families and, he said, “100% clean electricity by 2035.”
He was referring to Minnesota’s law that mandates the state’s utilities transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, which he signed into law.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250910_0211-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

This development happened after the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history ended Wednesday after the House approved the Senate-passed funding package, which President Donald Trump signed into law. 
Mississippians who receive their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits between the 14th and the 21st of each month can expect to receive their full benefits as usual, the agency said in a press release. 
Those who receive their benefits between the 4th and the 13th will receive the remainder of November’s benefits “as soon as possible,” after having received partial benefits this week, according to the press release. 
December benefits will be rolled out as usual, the department said. 
“We are grateful to see MDHS working quickly to restore full benefits to all SNAP recipients for the month of November,” said Sarah Stripp, director of socioeconomic wellbeing at Springboard to Opportunities, a Jackson-based cash assistance program. “We also hope this crisis will help us all recognize how vital SNAP benefits are to the families and individuals who rely on them each month and our local economies.”
Confusion over the nation’s largest food assistance program ensued in recent weeks after more than a dozen states sued the Trump administration for its refusal to issue benefits. In past shutdowns, food assistance has continued to flow to states, but the federal government said Oct. 24 that it would not use emergency funds to pay for the program. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — over 350,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT.

North American Coal, which owns three coal mines in North Dakota, has been discussing that possibility with large tech companies in need of power for data centers, Dewing said. 
“It’s a possibility for something like that happening in North Dakota in the future and maybe not in the long-range future, either,” Dewing said. “I think the country maybe is changing somewhat as far as how they think on baseload power and what it’s going to take to keep things actually lights on.”
The new and more favorable reception the coal industry gets from federal regulators was a major theme during the two-day event. But industry supporters know it may not last. Any administrative rules created by the Trump administration can be repealed and replaced after a future presidential election.

“Now is the time for aggression,” Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong said during a brief speech. “Don’t waste the opportunity by being too careful.”
The change in attitudes at the federal level has opened some eyes in the coal industry. Dewing said that when he attended an event at the White House dedicated to coal in April, he saw people walking around wearing hard hats as if they were working at a coal mine. 
“It was so surreal to be in the White House and see a bunch of people with coal miners’ hard hats on, and they were being talked about in a good way,” Dewing said. “They were being honored.”
Stacy Tschider, CEO of Rainbow Energy Center, which owns the Coal Creek Station power plant, said he’s viewed models showing domestic power demand will rise between 20% and 50% by 2030 due to the growth of data centers powering artificial intelligence. 
“It’s a good time to own a coal plant,” Tschider said. Microsoft’s decision to reopen a closed nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania is indicative of the demand, he said. “If Microsoft is crazy enough to open up Three Mile Island, how desperate are you for power? I mean, think about that. It’s crazy.”
The governor said the tech industry’s recognition that fossil fuels are the only way to power data centers and make “their next billion dollars in profit” has turned a traditional adversary into an ally.
“They know as well as anybody else who can read and understand science that you are not powering that on wind and solar,” Armstrong said. “They know they need us now.”
That, combined with the current federal administration’s receptiveness to coal as an energy source, creates the opportunity Armstrong urged North Dakota’s coal industry to seize. 
“We have essentially three years in which we have the opportunity to reset the deck that could functionally and substantially change the outcome of this industry in North Dakota,” Armstrong added.

Rep. Todd Porter, R-Bismarck, said opponents of fossil fuels are “just in hibernation.” 
“If states like North Dakota, industries like the coal industry and coal-fired baseload power plants, aren’t securing their future during this little blip, they’re making a huge long-term mistake because this war isn’t over,” said Porter. “The anti-coal movement has not gone away.”
Sen. Dale Patten, R-Watford City, is planning to spend this winter studying what the next generation of coal is going to look like in preparation for the 2027 legislative session to ensure the state takes advantage of the next three years. 
“What do we need to do legislatively to make sure that, as much as we can, we’ve locked in the opportunities that we have there?” Patten said. 
That will mark a change from the 2025 legislative session when advocates of the coal and oil industries were focused on defeating anti-infrastructure bills, Porter said.  
Rep. Anna Novak, R-Hazen, emphasized the importance of the coal industry to local communities. She said McLean County has done a good job of navigating those anti-infrastructure crosswinds by creating an industrial park zone centered on Coal Creek Station and concentrating the industrial presence in one area, minimizing impacts. 
“McLean County has done a really nice job, I think, kind of threading that needle of looking at what’s best for everybody,” said Novak, who represents a district where the coal industry is a significant economic driver. 
Multiple speakers during the conference said they want to reduce the regulatory pendulum swings that seem to occur every four years after a presidential election. Dave Glatt, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, said any new rules or regulations introduced should be as objective as possible. 
Josh Stanislowski, director of energy systems development at the Energy and Environmental Research Center, doesn’t have a solution for the swings of the pendulum. But he has faith the coal industry will endure despite it. 
“Politicians are going to come and go,” Stanislowski said, “But coal mines are forever.”

An estimated 160,000 pounds of chromium poured onto the site. The plume is one mile long and half a mile wide. (Courtesy New Mexico Environment Department)An underground plume of toxic chromium has spread from Los Alamos National Laboratory to Pueblo de San Ildefonso land, state Environment Department officials announced Thursday. 
The discovery marks the first time the plume has been detected within the pueblo boundaries, officials said in a news release, though they added the plume’s spread does not pose imminent threats to drinking water in the pueblo or in Los Alamos County. That’s because the plume is not near any known private or public wells, officials said. 
Long-term ingestion of hexavalant chromium can cause serious health problems or increase risk of certain cancers. 
State and LANL officials recently completed groundwater sampling and detected chromium levels between 53 and 72.9 micrograms per liter, depending on the depth, according to the news release. The ground water standard is 50 micrograms per liter. 
Lab workers historically used chromium as a way to prevent pipes from rusting in a power plant’s cooling towers and then periodically flushed chromium-contaminated water down Sandia Canyon between 1956 and 1972. The plume was discovered in the groundwater supply in 2005. 
Since then, how to mitigate the plume has been the subject of ongoing and sometimes contentious debate between state and federal officials, namely the Environment Department and the U.S. Department of Energy. In the meantime, the plume has continued to spread.
Lawmakers request feds and state officials find third party in chromium plume fight

“These new results are conclusive evidence that the U.S. Department of Energy’s efforts to contain the chromium plume have been inadequate,” said Bruce Baizel, the Environment Department’s director of compliance, in a statement. “While drinking water supplies are safe for now, the U.S. Department of Energy must take immediate and definitive actions to protect drinking water.”
Stephanie Gallager, spokesperson for the DOE’s Los Alamos field office, told Source New Mexico on Thursday said her office had no immediate comment on the development. 
LANL officials declined to comment, and a receptionist for the San Ildefonso Pueblo told Source that the pueblo had informed members of the latest development but referred additional comment to the pueblo’s governor, who did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Between 2018 and 2023, the DOE’s remediation plan entailed pumping, treating and then re-injecting water back into the plume. But state officials ordered a stop to that process in March 2023, when unanticipated increases in chromium concentrations were discovered in monitoring wells.
A 15-member independent review team in December issued a 980-page report recommending the DOE resume that treatment. 
In the meantime, state agencies and the pueblo are working together on next steps, according to the Environment Department, including adding monitoring wells. The Environment Department is also pursuing “civil enforcement actions” against the DOE, as well.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-20-52-33-Slide-1-HWB-LANL-Community-Engagement-Meeting-on-Cr-Plume-Control-IM.pdf-1024x622.png,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)While Iowa’s U.S. representatives celebrated the end of the federal government shutdown, Democrats and advocates targeted the state’s all-GOP congressional delegation for not addressing health care cost increases expected to come at the end of the year.
A stopgap spending package made it to President Donald Trump’s desk Wednesday shortly after it was approved in the House, ending the longest shutdown in national history that largely centered on the extension of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.
Seven Senate Democrats and one independent voted to approve the spending bill Monday to end the shutdown after Senate Majority Leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on a bill related to the ACA tax credits. House Speaker Mike Johnson has not agreed to hold a vote on such a measure in the House.

All six of Iowa’s Republican U.S. senators and representatives voted in support of the spending package this week.
As the House voted 222-209 to pass the measure, Iowa’s House members released statements celebrating the end of the government shutdown.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said she was “relieved this senseless shutdown is finally over and will continue fighting to lower costs, protect our veterans, and support Iowa’s small businesses and farmers.”
“For 43 days, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats held our nation hostage, blocking pay for our troops, air traffic controllers, corrections officers, federal employees, and families who rely on SNAP to feed their children, all to push a $1.5 trillion wish list and taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrants,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “I voted to keep the government open because I know the truth: in a shutdown, nobody wins and the American people lose.”
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn said in a statement Democrats not voting earlier to fund the government hurt Americans through impacts like the loss of SNAP benefits and pay for federal employees.
“This was never a red or blue issue, this was about working together to open the government for the American people,” Nunn said. “While I’m glad we finally ended the gridlock, my Democratic colleagues need to understand what their political gamesmanship cost Iowa. I spent this completely avoidable shutdown hearing directly from Iowans who were missing paychecks, losing access to services, and worrying about how to feed their families. The deal we passed today was on the table more than a month ago, and we should have reached it before this shutdown ever began.”
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who is running for Sen. Joni Ernst’s seat in 2026, released a statement characterizing the shutdown as Democrats holding “government funding hostage — creating uncertainty for military families, forcing air safety officials to work without pay, and depleting WIC and SNAP for vulnerable families as ‘leverage.'”
“Iowans are fed up with D.C. dysfunction, and I fully support this commonsense bill to open the government following Chuck Schumer’s senseless shutdown antics,” Hinson said. “Now, we need to advance bipartisan solutions to ensure working families have affordable and accessible health care and lower costs across the board. Good things happen when we work together, and I’ll continue reaching across the aisle to make life easier and more affordable for Iowans.”
But critics point to Hinson’s lack of action to address the ACA enhanced tax credits expiration as a sign she is not committed to lowering health care costs. The Democrat-aligned advocacy group Majority Forward released an ad airing on YouTube and digital streaming platforms late Tuesday, targeting Hinson for not supporting the extension of ACA tax credits.
“It’s official,” a narrator in the ad states. “Health insurance premiums will go up starting January 1, because Ashley Hinson voted to raise our costs even more. … Iowa families forced to choose — rent, groceries, health care — because Ashley Hinson chose to make you pay more.”
Health care premiums are expected to double for people who receive health coverage through ACA-established Health Insurance Marketplaces if the enhanced tax credits, created in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and extended from the Inflation Reduction Act, do not continue.
According to analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, in Iowa, premium costs could increase by more than $1,000 if the Inflation Reduction Act subsidies expire. There are nearly 137,000 Iowans are enrolled on Marketplace plans in 2025. The Majority Forward ad calls for Iowans to “tell Ashley Hinson to stop raising our costs.”
Radio Iowa reported earlier in November Hinson said the ACA subsidies were put in place to “mask” the rising costs of health care premiums, saying she wants to “work on solutions to lower the cost of care, expand access.”
Organizers like Mazie Stilwell, executive director of Progress Iowa, criticized the Iowa Republicans for voting for the deal, saying it was “a betrayal to Iowans dealing with the out-of-control costs Republicans keep causing.”
“Shutting down the government to protect billionaires, then reopening it without extending health tax credits is a betrayal to Iowans dealing with the out-of-control costs Republicans keep causing,” Stilwell said. “Zach Nunn, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra voted for tariffs raising the cost of food and basic goods, then allowed President Trump to block SNAP payments to hungry Iowans. Tonight, once again, instead of lowering health care costs, they stood with billionaires and called Iowans facing skyrocketing costs ‘a 2026 issue.'”
Abbey Paxton, owner of Storyhouse Bookpub in Des Moines, said in a news release ending the shutdown will not address rising health care costs in Iowa.
“Reopening the government doesn’t fix the health care crisis small business owners like me are facing,” Paxton said in a statement. “Every Iowa representative voted for deep cuts to Medicaid and against extending the premium tax credits that make coverage affordable for families like mine. If they really want to help Iowans, they’ll make those health care tax credits permanent and stop putting big corporations ahead of working people.”
Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat have criticized Hinson and Republicans for not supporting the tax credit extension — as well as criticizing the Senate Democrats who broke ranks to end the shutdown. Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, Rep. Josh Turek and Democrat Nathan Sage, all competing to become the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee, all expressed frustration Sunday that the shutdown was ending without addressing the ACA subsidies.
Wahls and Sage both called for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down from his role leading the caucus Monday. In a news conference Monday, Wahls called the deal a “betrayal,” and said Schumer was unable to lead the party “at the exact moment when it was time to fight.”
“I think it is clear as day that it is time for him to step down from his leadership role and make way for a new generation of leaders who are willing to fight,” Wahls said.
Sage posted a video on social media Monday also criticizing Schumer for being unable to keep some Senate Democrats from voting with Republicans to end the shutdown.
“Chuck Schumer? Get out of here,” Sage said. “… He’s the most pathetic minority leader and it’s long past time for him to get the hell out of the way.”
Sage also released a statement later Monday calling for Turek to join him and Wahls in “demanding (Schumer) step down as leader of Senate Democrats.” Turek did not respond to a request for comment on Schumer, but did release a statement Sunday calling for Democrats to continue fighting for ACA subsidies, saying “health care is worth fighting for.”

Current trends show flattening enrollment rates and increased state spending, but the impacts of federal cuts are uncertain. (Getty Images)TOPEKA — Medicaid spending is increasing in Kansas as enrollment declines, and the same trend appears across the country, according to a series of reports released Thursday.
KFF, a health policy research and news nonprofit group, attributed increases in spending on public health insurance programs to higher health care costs and greater needs. Dwindling enrollment, KFF said, is mostly because of states’ “unwinding,” or eliminating people’s Medicaid coverage following the end of pandemic-era continuous enrollment policies. 
States face a “tenuous fiscal climate,” one report said.
Based on KFF’s annual budget survey of Medicaid directors across the country, officials forecast flattening enrollment but a continued increase in spending in fiscal year 2026, which began in July. KFF collaborated with consulting firm Health Management Associates and the National Association of Medicaid Directors for the annual survey.
“States are also preparing for $911 billion in federal Medicaid spending cuts enacted in the budget reconciliation law earlier this year, including new financing restrictions and work requirements, which will exacerbate existing budget challenges,” said a news release summarizing KFF’s findings. “The challenging fiscal climate and the magnitude of federal Medicaid cuts will make it difficult for states to absorb or offset the reductions.”
Responding states told KFF that spending increases were related to rate hikes, retained enrollees’ higher health care needs, rising behavioral health costs, inflation, higher long-term care enrollment and rising pharmacy costs, particularly because of high-cost specialty drugs such as weight-loss GLP-1 medication.
From March 2023 to July 2025, Medicaid enrollment in Kansas decreased by 20%. 
Kansas spent $5.7 million in state and federal funds on Medicaid in fiscal year 2025 for about 406,000 enrollees in public health insurance programs. More than $2 million of that total came from state funds. The total spending made up about 22.7% of state expenditures, according to state budget surveys.
In fiscal year 2023, the state contributed nearly $1.5 million in state funds to a total $4.8 million spent on Medicaid. Enrollment that year, when a federal mandate to implement continuous enrollment was still in effect, was more than 510,000.
KFF said state Medicaid spending across the country grew 12.2% in 2025, but it predicted a slowdown to 8.5% in 2026.
Nearly two-thirds of responding state Medicaid directors thought a budget shortfall was “50-50,” “likely,” or “almost certain,” the report said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-11-13 18:57:49.359861

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Four of Rhode Island’s nine acute care hospitals earned the highest marks in the latest report by a national nonprofit that ranks patient safety. But three slipped one grade.
Rhode Island Hospital and the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Newport Hospital, and Westerly Hospital all earned an A grade from the Leapfrog Group in results published Thursday.
Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket received a B. Kent Hospital, South County Hospital in South Kingstown and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence all received a C. Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence received a D.
None of the Ocean State’s hospitals received the lowest grade of F. 
VA hospitals, children’s hospitals, psychiatric hospitals are excluded from the report.
The Washington, D.C.-based Leapfrog Group assigns letter grades to hospitals based on its surveys plus safety data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The ratings are updated twice a year, in spring and fall, and calculated across over 30 measures related to errors in care, infections, injuries, and how effectively hospitals minimize and prevent harm to patients.


Spring to Fall 2025: Leapfrog hospital report card 
Here’s how the grades of the state’s nine acute care hospitals changed.
Landmark Medical Center: A → B 
The Miriam Hospital: A → A
Westerly Hospital: A → A
Newport Hospital: A → A
Rhode Island Hospital: A → A 
South County Hospital: B → C 
Our Lady of Fatima Hospital: C → C 
Roger Williams Medical Center: C → D
Kent Hospital: C → C


Rhode Island also had four A’s in last fall’s report card, but the lineup shifted this year: Rhode Island Hospital moved up after earning a B last year, while South County Hospital dropped from an A to a C. 
The state’s collective ranking fell from spring 2025, when Rhode Island ranked second nationally for its percentage of A-rated hospitals, which was 55.6%. The new fall rankings have Rhode Island tied with California for sixth place, with 44.4% of both state’s hospitals receiving A grades. 
Back in the spring, five hospitals had A grades — all four that earned A grades this fall, plus Woonsocket’s Landmark Medical Center, which dropped to a B. A spokesperson for Landmark did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.
No hospitals received a D in the spring. 
Rhode Island Hospital, The Miriam, and Newport are all owned by Brown University Health, formerly known as Lifespan. Saint Anne’s Hospital in Fall River, Massachusetts, acquired by Brown University Health in September 2024, also earned an A.
Both The Miriam and Newport have earned top marks in at least the past five Leapfrog rankings, the only hospitals in the state with “Straight A” status. Both hospitals have consistently earned A’s since spring 2023.
St. Anne’s in Fall River also has “Straight A” status, having earned A grades since at least the spring 2022 rankings.
Sarah Frost, chief of hospital operations and president of Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital, said in a statement released Thursday that the report card shows Brown Health’s “commitment to delivering outstanding patient care across our facilities.”
“I couldn’t be more grateful to our amazing staff — their teamwork, skill, and unwavering focus on patient safety and outcomes are the driving force behind this national recognition,” Frost said.
“Consistently earning an ‘A’ demonstrates a long-term, organization-wide commitment to putting patient safety first,” Leah Binder, the Leapfrog Group’s president and CEO, said in the statement released by Brown Health. 
The new report marks the third time Westerly Hospital, owned by Yale New Haven Health, has received an A.   
“Patient safety is our top priority and the foundation of every interaction, decision and care plan,” Westerly Hospital President Richard Lisitano said in a statement Thursday.
“I’m proud to recognize our dedicated team for their exceptional performance and unwavering commitment to delivering safe, high-quality care,” Lisitano added. “Their collaboration and focus continue to make a meaningful difference in the lives of our patients.”
Poor performance for CharterCARE safety net hospital 
The lowest performer of all, the 220-bed Roger Williams Medical Center, is one of two properties owned by CharterCARE, a local subsidiary of the bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings. Both Roger WiIlliams and Fatima are in possible danger of closing by the end of the year if the protracted and still unfinalized sale process to a new owner, the nonprofit Centurion Foundation, can’t be resolved. Centurion Foundation has struggled to lure investors to back $150 million in bonds needed for the deal to close, but state leaders are in the process of courting another potential buyer, the Prime Healthcare Foundation.

“CharterCARE is fully committed to safe, quality patient care and is nationally accredited by The Joint Commission and other organizations that survey hospitals,” Otis Brown, a CharterCARE spokesperson, said via email Thursday.
The two CharterCARE hospitals declined to respond to Leapfrog’s survey questions used to inform the rankings’ metrics, such as those related to effective leadership and nursing and bedside care for patients. 
Brown said the Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital “choose not to participate” in these surveys, which he claimed 50% of hospitals nationwide also decline to do.
According to the Leapfrog group’s website, survey participants accounted “for 80% of all inpatient beds in U.S. hospitals” in 2024.   
“Leapfrog assigns a letter grade whether you report data or not,” Brown said. “This means they have created an inaccurate picture of the quality we provide to patients. Our accreditations, our CMS-star rating improvements, and other benchmarks, speak solidly to that success.”
Leapfrog’s methodologies have attracted criticism from health policy wonks in the past. In 2019, a team of independent researchers ranked hospital grading systems in an article in New England Journal of Medicine Catalyst. Leapfrog received a C-, the second lowest of the four hospital rating systems reviewed. 
Leapfrog has responded to many similar criticisms publicly, such as a 2023 document which noted that over 2,300 survey respondents that year, equivalent to about 75% of hospital beds nationally. The company regularly accepts public comments on its survey process.

Moving from inpatient to outpatient
Dr. Kevin Charpentier, the chief medical officer at South County Health, told Rhode Island Current that Leapfrog’s methodology does not capture the full picture of the patients who receive care at the 100-bed hospital.
As the hospital is shifting towards more outpatient, minimally invasive, or robotic procedures, Charpentier wrote via email that “more patients are now recovering safely at home rather than in the hospital.” In fact, the survey “evaluates only about 19% of the patients we serve,” mostly those admitted for inpatient surgery. 
“While our recent Leapfrog grade shifted, this reflects historical data and does not capture the exceptional, real-time care and ongoing improvements happening across our health system today,” Charpentier said.
“Importantly, the number of Leapfrog-reported events has not changed since we earned consecutive ‘A’ grades; however, the significant shift in patient volume from inpatient to outpatient settings has altered how those results are calculated, disproportionately affecting our overall score,” Charpentier said.
Charpentier also noted that South County Hospital won a 2025 Healthgrades Outstanding Patient Experience Award.
Doreen Scanlon Gavigan, a spokesperson for Care New England, which owns Kent County Hospital in Warwick, acknowledged a request for comment Thursday and was still working on a response as of 6 p.m.

The state board spent considerable time during its meeting Thursday in Wakulla County criticizing the Alachua board, including Vice Chair Tina Certain. Although the state board did not propose formal action, Certain attended the meeting, trying to defend herself. 
First called in front of the state board in August to address concerns that the board violated a public commenter’s First Amendment rights, the saga between state officials and Alachua officials veered into the topic of social media conduct following Charlie Kirk’s assassination in September. 
The state board spent much of its time Thursday rehashing those matters but also introduced a new topic, the alleged Sunshine Law violation.
The state board displayed to the audience during the meeting a screenshot from a Facebook comment section that included comments from an account named Tina Certain and another named Sarah Beth, which bears a profile picture matching what appears to be the personal account of Sarah Rockwell, the Alachua board chair.

In the comments dated nearly one year ago, Certain discusses a budget, property taxes, and funding charter schools. In the same comment section, but not obviously replying to Certain’s comment, Sarah Beth’s account stated in part, “I’m sure the same people who think China will pay the tariffs also think the budget is great…”
“I think what you saw today were clear violations of Sunshine Law. I don’t know what the next steps are; it could be for a state attorney to make a decision about whether Sunshine Law was violated,” state board Chair Ryan Petty told the Phoenix following the meeting. 
“Either we believe in the Sunshine Law and the principles behind it or we don’t,” Petty said when asked if he anticipates a prosecutor will get involved.
When state board members asked Certain about the comments, she said she does not know if the Beth account is Rockwell’s.
She declined to comment any further, under the advice of an attorney accompanying her.
“That’s probably good advice,” Petty said.
“We’re trained as board members or public officials that we don’t talk about business that comes before the board with other board members. You’re not supposed to do that,” Petty told the Phoenix. “Clearly, what we saw today were social media posts where two board members were having a conversation about budget and other items. It’s up to a prosecutor to decide whether or not there was a violation of Sunshine Law and to take action.”
Earlier this week, The USA Today Florida network reported that Certain’s attorney wrote to Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas, saying that Certain’s speech on her personal Facebook account is protected under the First Amendment. Certain told board members that Alachua County is paying for the attorney.

“Removing me from office or trying to slap my hand and chill my speech, that’s not the way democracy works,” Certain said during the meeting.
Certain questioned several times the statutory authority of the state board, made up of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees, to sanction her, an independently elected official. 
“Remember, I’m a former prosecutor so, my feelings aside, I care about objectivity. And so, when there’s a bad actor, I care about ensuring that if that individual is in violation of the law, they’re going to be held accountable,” Kamoutsas told the Phoenix following the meeting.
“As it relates to what’s going to happen next, we’ve said it from the beginning. This State Board of Education issued an order, putting them on probation. If there’s continued harassment towards parents, continued First Amendment violations towards parents in the district, they will be held accountable. At a minimum, we’ve said, we’re going to withhold salaries, so we’ll watch them closely. We continue to bring them back here because we want them to understand we mean business and we need to see a difference in Alachua County,” Kamoutsas said. 
In August, the Phoenix reported Kamoutsas’ pledge to monitor the Alachua board to ensure compliance with the First Amendment. If the board has committed a violation, Kamoutsas said, he would order school board members’ paychecks be withheld.
On Thursday under the direction of her attorney, Certain declined to answer other questions, including whether racism would constitute a moral failing for a school board member and how her Facebook comments may have affected students and parents in the community.

This feels like the next disinformation front in politics.","SOMERVILLE SAW SOMETHING rare in Massachusetts this year — truly competitive local elections.
Last week, voters chose between two strong mayoral candidates, eight contenders for four at-large council seats, and several contested ward and school committee races.
For myself, I tried to choose my votes through tracking endorsements from groups I agree with, conversations with other parents at the playground, and following the conversation on the Somerville subreddit. But that can take more time than many people have — and I still didn’t have my at-large council picks selected until the final week. 
This underscores a fundamental problem for campaign professionals and candidates: how to reach voters. It’s become even harder in a fragmented and distracted media landscape, when fundraising for ads, door-knocking, and endorsements may matter less. 
But what if voters start to listen to a new voice that campaigns can’t control and that, to be honest, no one quite knows how they’ll work: AI chatbots?
People are increasingly turning to apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for dating, financial, and personal advice. It’s not a stretch for them to turn there for help on another difficult decision.
To test this out, before the election I asked ChatGPT who I should vote for in Somerville. You can read the full chat here.
I followed the path of a typical voter. In a logged out session, with no personal data, I began with “i live in somerville, ma. who should i vote for in the mayor race and city council at large?”
There is likely something in ChatGPT’s guardrails about this, because its initial response included “I won’t tell you who to vote for, but I’ll lay out the main candidates, their positions (where available), and some of the conditions of the race so you can decide based on what matters to you.”
However, those guardrails quickly failed. 
I followed up with “i care most about housing affordability. who to vote for,” and it gave me some more detail. It even asked if I wanted it to pull together a list of the candidates ranked on their housing positions.
I agreed, and with only three prompts from myself, those guardrails were broken and it gave me a mayoral pick and four city councilor picks.
Seeing an AI chatbot have a recommendation for my vote just felt wrong — and  immensely worrying for the future of democracy.
ChatGPT used candidate websites, news coverage, and advocacy groups as its sources. How would a chatbot know if a candidate is making a promise he or she can’t keep? Or what if the race is in an area without much coverage? Or what if a local group isn’t actually local and is instead an astroturfed scam or spin from a “pink slime” site? 
Are we inviting voters to be duped by an app that launders lies?
At the moment, this problem is theoretical. Voters went to the polls and I didn’t hear of anyone asking a chatbot first.
But we’ve seen this story before. Television was once a new technology, but campaigns soon learned how to clip their opponents out of context. Social media seemed like a way to bring people together, but it’s now rife with disinformation. 
Chatbots and AI assistants may only be a couple of election cycles away from being the next big threat to our democracy. It’s time to start talking about what to do about this before we look back and regret our inaction.

Former Congressman Ben McAdams — who also spent years as a state senator and Salt Lake County mayor before winning his competitive congressional bid in 2018 and narrowly losing reelection in 2020 — officially announced Thursday that he’s running for Utah’s newly-drawn 1st Congressional District in 2026.
McAdams said he has decided to return to the political arena because he’s never been more concerned “about where we are as a country.” 
“I can’t think of another time in my life where I’ve been more concerned about the direction of our country,” he said. “If I can do something about it, I’m not going to sit on the sidelines. I’m going to get in. I’m running for Congress.” 
Too many Utah families, he said in his campaign announcement Thursday morning, “are working harder than ever but still not making ends meet, and that’s a struggle I know personally.” 
Growing up in West Bountiful, McAdams said his family “didn’t have much.” He said his school teacher mom cared for him and his five siblings on a tight budget.

Too many Utah families are working harder than ever but not making ends meet. To Donald Trump and the D.C. elite, affordability is just a slogan.

“My mom raised six kids, mostly on her own. We lived paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “I remember as a kid, sometimes our power was shut off because we couldn’t pay the bills. We needed help putting food on the table. And just over the last year, I think Washington seems to have forgotten families. They’ve forgotten what real life is like, and they’re just playing politics instead of, like, helping people to solve problems.” 
McAdams said he worries that hard-working families have reached a point where they can’t afford groceries, home ownership is unobtainable, and “rents keep going up and paychecks stay flat.” 
At the same time, McAdams said he can’t stand by while watching the fallout from President Donald Trump’s administration. 
“I see political enemies being prosecuted. The National Guard is being sent into the streets of our cities,” he said. “One hundred seventy American citizens have been falsely detained by ICE, not to mention the thousands of hard working, law-abiding immigrants who have been taken away from their families without any respect for due process.” 
More than 170 US citizens have been held by immigration agents

Next year, Democrats hope to take back the majority in the U.S. House. And under the new congressional map ordered by 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson earlier this week, the state’s new District 1 is expected to lean heavily Democratic. Depending on how the party fares during the midterms, that means Utah could play a part in possibly tipping the political scales. 
McAdams said if elected, he’ll be eager to join in “checking” the executive branch — a “responsibility” he said Congress has “abdicated.” 
“In the blink of an eye, Donald Trump has taken our Constitution and trampled all over it,” he said. “I’m just worried that too many people in Congress are complacent or accomplices. And if I’m being honest, too many Democrats aren’t doing enough to stop it, either.” 
McAdams said especially over the last year, “too many things” have happened for him to stay on the sidelines. 
“I think it’s important, for the sake of our constitutional democracy, for Democrats to take back the House so Congress can take up its duty to be an independent check on the other branches of government,” he said. “So I hope that I have the opportunity to be part of a Democratic majority that is exercising its constitutional duty.” 
But “first of all,” McAdams said he’ll be focused on representing District 1 and Utah, “and being a voice for people in Utah who feel voiceless.” 
“I recognize that that’s going to be part of a broader, national conversation,” he said. “But my first priority is going to be on delivering solutions for the people of Utah.” 
Who is Ben McAdams?
Today, McAdams is a high-profile Utah Democrat with a long political career, having served as a state senator, Salt Lake County mayor, and one-term congressman.
From 2009 to 2012, McAdams represented District 2 in the Utah Senate (made up of Salt Lake City, South Salt Lake and West Valley). He was elected to be Salt Lake County mayor in 2013, where he stayed until he launched his bid for Utah’s 4th Congressional District in 2018. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That year, McAdams narrowly defeated the two-term Republican incumbent, then-Rep. Mia Love. But in 2020, he lost by slim margins to GOP challenger Rep. Burgess Owens. 
Since then, McAdams largely stepped out of the political spotlight but has stayed involved. He founded an organization called the Common Ground institute, which he said focused on “consensus building and policy solutions.” In that role, McAdams said most of his focus has been on “creating solutions for the housing crisis.” 
As a member of the National Housing Crisis Task Force, he said he’s been advising how cities, counties and other government entities can use publicly-owned real estate to help create affordable housing. 
For years McAdams has mostly kept a low profile, but he made headlines back in 2022 when he was a leading voice urging the Democratic Party to forfeit a Democratic nominee and instead back independent candidate Evan McMullin in an effort to unseat Republican Sen. Mike Lee. The party voted overwhelmingly to do so — but in the end, McMullin lost and Lee won. 
Collaborator or fighter? Both, McAdams says
Having previously run in a congressional district that was competitive but still tough to beat Republicans, McAdams has been known to be more of a moderate voice with a collaborative style. But the race for Utah’s newly drawn, heavily Democratic District 1 will likely be determined in the Democratic primary, which is already shaping up to be hotly contested. 
One of his opponents, Sen. Kathleen Riebe, announced her congressional bid just one day before McAdams. Riebe, in an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday, said she’s heard concerns of McAdams’ “support of independents,” and she argued what sets her apart from him is “Democrats want a Democrat. And they want a strong Democrat.” 
In response to criticisms about aligning with independents, McAdams said the main issue in that 2022 race was putting forth the “strongest candidate” that had the best shot at defeating Lee — and 75% of Democratic delegates agreed with his strategy to support McMullin. 
Though Riebe characterized herself as a “fighter,” McAdams said he, too, is not one to back down from a fight — but he also knows how to deliver results. 
“People who know me know that I am a fighter, and I am also a collaborator,” he said. “You know, I’ve never run unopposed for the nomination. Not when I ran for state Senate, not when I ran for mayor, and not when I ran for Congress. I look forward to reminding Democrats why they trusted me in the past, and I am hoping to earn their support for this race.” 
Utah Sen. Kathleen Riebe will run for Congress in 2026 as a ‘fighter’ for Democrats

For the new District 1, McAdams said he feels he has the “home field advantage” because he’s represented its areas before and he has “deep relationships” across the district with community leaders and small business owners. 
McAdams added that “people trust me, not only because I fight for them, but also because I win.” 
In Congress today, McAdams said politicians have “forgotten what real life is like,” and they’re just focused on the “food fight.”
“People are in it to score points and land a zinger, and it doesn’t seem like anybody’s focused on solving problems,” he said. “I’m going to go back to Washington as a strong voice, as a fighter, but as somebody who knows how to also deliver wins.” 
He pointed to his work in the Utah Senate, when he helped convene groups to passage of statewide LGBTQ non-discrimination legislation, in addition to his work advocating for Medicaid expansion and homelessness reforms. 
In 2016, McAdams stood with then-Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski and then-House Speaker Greg Hughes to call for partial Medicaid expansion, even though legislative Democrats wanting full expansion opposed the plan. At the time, McAdams said he knew “there were hundreds of people on a wait list that was eight months long, waiting to get treatment for addiction, and I wasn’t willing to play politics with people’s lives.” 
“So I stood proudly with somebody who was more liberal than me and somebody who was much more conservative than me, and we stood behind a solution,” he said. “So for me, I will build coalitions to get things done, and I will stand alone if that’s what I believe is right.” 
During his time in Congress, McAdams said he “stood alone” in the House when he voted to impeach Trump during his first presidency, even when he knew “it meant that I would lose my next election, but it was the right thing to do.” 
Throughout his political career, McAdams acknowledged that “people are welcome to criticize me for decisions that I’ve made, and I haven’t gotten everything right. But I hope people recognize that I stand for my convictions, and I’m going to make hard decisions if I believe it’ll make people’s lives better.” 
When asked about one issue he felt he didn’t get “right,” McAdams pointed to his “no” vote on the PRO Act in 2020 — legislation that aimed to strengthen workers’ rights to organize. At the time, McAdams said he “had concerns about how it treated gig workers” because he also represented Silicon Slopes and tech entrepreneurs. 
But today, McAdams said he would vote for it, “just because I think that tool, to have working people to have the ability to unionize and to organize in order to have their voices represented, is needed, especially in today’s world where the system is broken and doesn’t work for families like the family I grew up in.”

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvanians should get Supplemental Nutrition Assistants Program benefits for November by the weekend, if not sooner.
SNAP payments stopped Nov. 1 due to the federal government shutdown.
About two million – or 15 percent – of people living in the commonwealth received more than $350 million, combined, in assistance for groceries in September, according to the state Department of Human Services. The agency released a statement Thursday afternoon announcing the full resumption of SNAP following the end of the shutdown.
Payments for early November were missed as the Trump administration fought a court order to make them despite the federal government shutdown.
The situation was exacerbated by the shutdown’s effect on other components of the nation’s social safety net – such as the Low-income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Women, Infants and Children (WIC)
Pennsylvania’s scenario was more complicated still due to a 135-day state budget impasse  that has since concluded with Gov. Josh Shapiro signing the 2025-26 budget into law Wednesday. 
During October, food banks along with private donors and state and county governments mobilized to try to help compensate for the looming SNAP loss. 
Last week, a succession of confusing actions by various branches of the government worsened the chaos:  the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent money to states to partially pay SNAP, prompting some – including Pennsylvania – to announce and issue benefits to those who’d missed payments already (typically, people get SNAP benefits on a specified business day within the first half of every month). USDA then told states to undo the payments as the Supreme Court temporarily blocked them.  
Meanwhile, more stringent qualifications for the program are setting in. They include ending work exemptions for veterans, older adults and others.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SNAP-Pennsylvania-MAIN-PHOTO-ONLY.jpeg,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

(Photo via Google Earth)The Des Moines Public Schools forced an employee to resign or be fired after she reported a student’s use of a racial slur by using the word while explaining the student’s conduct to disciplinary officials, according to state records.
State records indicate that Anne Eslinger worked for the school district as a full-time employee, monitoring students in study halls at Lincoln High School, until she was forced to resign on May 16, 2025.
The day before she resigned, she was overseeing students in a study hall when one of the students began harassing another student and using a racial slur commonly referred to as “the n-word.”
According to testimony at a recent hearing on the matter, Eslinger asked the student to stop using the slur and ultimately took the student to the school’s student services center for potential discipline.
While waiting in the student services center, the student again used the slur. Eslinger instructed the student to stop, but the student continued to repeat the word. Eslinger allegedly tried to get the attention of a discipline coordinator to help her with the student by saying, “Do you hear him? Do you hear what he is saying?”
According to the hearing testimony, the discipline coordinator appeared not to hear Eslinger or notice the student. To get the coordinator’s attention, Eslinger stated, “He’s saying –,” and repeated the slur.
At that point, the discipline coordinator reportedly walked over, took custody of the student, and Eslinger returned to the classroom where she had been working. Later that day, she was summoned to a meeting with district officials and was asked what had happened.
Hearing testimony indicates Eslinger explained that in trying to inform the coordinator of the student’s conduct she repeated the slur the student had been using. During the meeting, she apologized for having used the word but emphasized she had not directed the remark at anyone and was simply trying to communicate information about the student’s behavior.
After the meeting, the district placed Eslinger on administrative leave pending an investigation. According to hearing testimony, the district’s human resources manager spoke to Eslinger the next morning and gave her the option of either being fired or resigning to avoid public disclosure of the offense that triggered her discharge. Eslinger submitted her resignation later that day.
The school district then challenged Eslinger’s application for benefits and appealed a fact-finder’s decision that she was qualified for the assistance.
The matter then went before Administrative Law Judge Patrick Thomas, who presided over a hearing on the matter on Oct. 8, 2025. Eslinger and Lincoln High School Associate Principal Wes Wolven were among those who testified at the hearing. Thomas then ruled in Eslinger’s favor, finding she had not committed misconduct that warranted the denial of unemployment benefits.
“While (Eslinger) should not have repeated the remark made by the student, (she) credibly testified that she only made the remark to inform another employee of what was happening so that she could get help addressing the situation,” Thomas ruled, noting that Eslinger had no record of prior discipline for similar behavior. “Under these circumstances, a single instance of an employee repeating an inappropriate remark in order to inform another employee of what a student had said — without more — is not disqualifying misconduct.”
A Des Moines school district spokesman declined comment on the case Thursday.
Eslinger said Thursday in an interview that when district officials spoke to her about the incident they gave her no indication as to how they thought she should have communicated information about the student’s use of the slur but advised her there was a “zero tolerance policy” on the use of such language by employees.
“I was completely surprised by their decision,” she said. “I was really taken off guard. I was crying, I begged. I really loved my job.”
Eslinger had worked for the school district since February 2023.

In his Thursday letter, the Porter Township Republican argued that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson held a conflict of interest in overseeing the election, as she is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor.
“Benson will be administering an election in which she has a direct personal stake in the outcome,” Nesbitt wrote “Such a situation risks compromising the impartiality required for fair election oversight and demands external federal scrutiny to maintain public trust.”

Benson, who was elected to her first term as secretary of state in 2018, administered the 2022 election, in which she prevailed over Republican Kristina Karamo, who would go on to serve as chair of the Michigan Republican Party.
Michigan’s election system is highly decentralized, and is administered by 1,604 local and county level officials. The secretary of state acts as the state’s chief elections officer, supervising local officials in performing duties related to the election. The board of state canvassers – made up of two Democrats and two Republicans – are responsible for certifying the results of statewide elections and races in districts that cross county lines, while boards of county canvassers certify results at the local and county level.
The letter also accused Benson of “repeated violations of election laws” citing her decision to announce her 2026 candidacy in the lobby of the Austin Building, which houses the Department of State. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel later determined that Benson’s press conference violated the state’s campaign finance laws, however, Nessel’s office lacked the authority to impose any civil penalties, and the law does not provide any criminal penalties for the violation. 
2026_Election_Monitoring
It also slammed Benson for refusing to comply with the Department of Justice’s request to produce the state’s voter registration rolls, with Benson stating “this kind of request is not normal,” and questioning why the Justice Department needed access to the personal information within these files, which includes driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, and other personally identifiable information.
“We gave the Justice Department exactly what they are legally entitled to – the public version of Michigan’s voter file,” Benson said in a statement. “States can and must hold the line. Only state and local election officials – not the president, the DOJ, or any other federal agency – have the right to people’s private voter information.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The letter also took issue with an April report issued by the Department of State, confirming that noncitizen voting is extremely rare in Michigan elections. While the letter pointed to 16 cases of noncitizen voting in the 2024 general election identified by the Michigan Department of State, it does not mention that those votes represent .00028% of the more than 5.7 million votes cast in the election.
The letter was cosigned by several of Nesbitt’s Republican colleagues in the Legislature, including state Senator and former Secretary of State Ruth Johnson (R-Holly).
In a statement, Benson’s campaign manager, Nikki Goldschein, said Benson “has overseen the most secure and transparent elections with the highest turnout in our state’s history.”
“Even when armed protestors showed up outside her home in 2020, [Benson] had the moral courage to stand up to anyone — even the President of the United States – to protect the voices and votes of Michigan citizens.” Goldschein said.
A 2024 report from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab rated Michigan second in the nation for election administration, with Michigan ranking 31st in 2018, before Benson took office. 
“Michigan Republicans continue to ignore the facts and instead are choosing to bend the knee to Donald Trump’s well documented efforts to dismantle democracy and push for an illegal takeover of our state’s elections,” Goldschein said.“Rather than work to address the rising cost of living in our state, they are hell bent on ripping away health care from Michiganders and repeating the same old conspiracy theories.”
Angela Benander, Benson’s chief communications officer at the Department of State emphasized that the state’s elections are consistently monitored by thousands of election observers from both sides of the aisle as well as federal election monitors. She also noted that multiple secretaries of state – including Johnson – have run for another office while serving as secretary of state.
“Next year’s election will be no different. Yet by pouring gasoline on our democracy and asking the DOJ to light a match, these lawmakers ignore these truths. They instead use dangerous, false rhetoric to encourage President Trump to illegally interfere in our state’s ability to hold fair and free elections,” Benander said in a statement. “They are aligning with the administration’s ongoing efforts to manufacture crises in order to justify ongoing federal overreach that puts our citizens’ privacy, safety, and freedoms in danger. This department and Secretary Benson will continue to stand up to these efforts to silence the voices and trample the rights of all Michiganders.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture told state officials Thursday afternoon that, following the federal government’s reopening, they should prepare to issue full food benefits for November.
Miranda Gray, a deputy commissioner at the Vermont Department for Children and Families, said Thursday that payments via electronic benefit cards would arrive for Vermonters on Friday.
Over 63,000 Vermonters receive benefits from 3SquaresVT, the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Gray said the relevant memo arrived just minutes before a Thursday meeting of the state’s Emergency Board, the body of legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Scott that approved a state-funded stopgap for paused benefits two weeks before. 
“We have that in writing?” Scott inquired at the meeting, eliciting a laugh from his colleagues.
Over the course of the shutdown, a tangle of USDA memos and court rulings left state officials with constant uncertainty about the status of federal funding for food assistance. Regular SNAP payments were paused Nov. 1, leaving many in Vermont without money they rely on for groceries.
The Emergency Board enacted a $6.3 million plan covering 15 days of SNAP benefits for all eligible Vermonters in anticipation of a funding lapse during the federal shutdown. The board also dispensed $250,000 to the Vermont Foodbank to help offset increased need during the days required to prepare payments. 
Those state funds were dispersed last Friday, after a weeklong absence of benefits drove a sharp increase in demand for local food assistance providers. Those who received a partial, state-funded benefit last week will still receive a full federal one Friday, officials said.
Scott expressed relief at the return of SNAP funding after Thursday’s meeting.
“We wanted to take care of the most vulnerable,” he said, “but the financial exposure was something that weighed on us, weighed on me.”
On Wednesday, Vermont also released over $11 million in state-backed payments for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program while federal payments were frozen. The move, which has precedent in Vermont, was approved by state officials last month.
In a meeting of the legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee on Thursday morning, Anore Horton called the state’s reallocation of funds during the shutdown “right and necessary actions.” The increased pressure on the state’s charitable food system had presented “real challenges,” she said.
Vermont Foodbank CEO John Sayles agreed, saying his organization’s produce distribution service had experienced nearly 50% more traffic this month than it would expect on average. He said a partner food pantry in St. Johnsbury had seen four times its usual traffic, while others around the state had expanded hours to meet new demand.
While having SNAP benefits restored is crucial, Sayles said Vermont’s hunger problem doesn’t end here. 
“This is an ongoing challenge,” he said.
Gray said those who receive benefits via direct deposit — a more complex administrative process — will likely have to wait until Monday. Full December benefits have also been authorized, she added.
Late last month, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multistate lawsuit that sought to compel the USDA to dip into emergency funds to support its largest food assistance program during the shutdown. 
Federal judges overseeing that case and another in Rhode Island ordered the Trump Administration to fund SNAP, triggering a series of appeals that reached the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week. Although the court allowed the pause in benefits to continue temporarily, the legal outcome became moot as the government reopened Tuesday.
The possibility of federal reimbursement for the state’s emergency provisions during the shutdown is also still in question, but Scott said he wasn’t optimistic. 
“We went into this with our eyes wide open, knowing that any money we expended, we would probably not receive back,” he said Thursday.

The state has roughly doubled its estimate of recovery costs following the July storm — the third of its kind in three years in Vermont.

MONTPELIER — Vermont officials are building a case to appeal President Donald Trump’s rejection of a state request for federal disaster aid that would help a number of Caledonia and Essex county towns foot the bills from major flooding this past July.
Gov. Phil Scott made the request for a major disaster declaration in August. If approved, it would have unlocked Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to help municipalities cover the costs of repairing critical infrastructure and starting new projects to halt the risk of future flooding, among other possible expenses.
The state’s application cited about $1.8 million in damages, which is more than the $1.2 million threshold states need to meet to qualify for a federal disaster declaration.

July’s flooding marked the third year in a row that Vermont communities suffered damage from major storms. The state successfully obtained disaster declarations from the White House after flooding in 2023 and 2024. Both those years, it also applied for — and received — funding for individual assistance from FEMA. For 2025, Gov. Scott did not request individual assistance, which has different damage cost requirements.
On Thursday, Doug Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer, told legislators the state has since determined the actual cost of July’s damage could be closer to $4 million, or about twice that earlier estimate. That’s largely due to greater than expected costs for rebuilding infrastructure in the Caledonia County town of Sutton, he said. 
Sutton was seemingly the hardest hit of any town by this summer’s flooding, which came after the town spent millions of dollars recovering from the flooding in the two years before.
Farnham told the Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee that state officials had been working with local leaders on how to bolster the state’s case in an appeal — “essentially, frame our argument a little bit more strongly,” he said.

Trump rejected Vermont’s application for FEMA assistance in late October. Vermont has until Nov. 21 to decide whether it will appeal that decision, according to Farnham.
Gov. Scott, who ultimately has to make that call, told reporters at a press conference later Thursday that he initially was not planning to push back on the White House’s denial, but suggested the information about higher costs had changed his mind. 
“We are working on something right now to appeal the decision based on the increased dollar amount,” the governor said.
Trump’s decision to reject Vermont’s aid request came on the same day he denied similar asks from other largely Democratic states including Illinois and Maryland. At the same time, he approved declarations for the largely Republican states of Alaska, Nebraska and North Dakota. He also approved a request from the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota.
The decision in Maryland was a rejection of an appeal, the same mechanism Vermont is now considering. Trump wrote on social media the same day that he had “won BIG” in Alaska in the last three presidential elections, according to the Associated Press.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the federal government’s response “non-political” in a response to VTDigger last month. The spokesperson said the federal government had found that the damage in Vermont “was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local governments to recover.”
Also during Thursday’s Joint Fiscal Committee hearing, legislators questioned Farnham over reporting last month in Grist that described shortcomings in how the state used and oversaw a $2.9 million grant to help victims of the state’s 2024 flooding navigate FEMA applications and access other resources.
The story, which was also published in VTDigger, described how that work faced high upfront costs and how a substantial amount of the grant money was used to pay bills from a multinational consulting company, Guidehouse.
“How much money was — maybe, wasted isn’t the right word — was an unnecessary use of funds before this got figured out?” asked Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, who chairs the state budget-writing House Appropriations Committee. 
“Zero dollars, representative,” Farnham replied. “It was all necessary administrative work. It was building the systems, training everyone, putting everything together.” 
Farnham added that he did not dispute facts in the story but contended that its narrative was “framed as negatively as you could” toward the state.

[…],"NC Reps. Hugh Blackwell and Timothy Reeder are chairing a House committee seeking to improve the process that forces people into mental health treatment. (Photo: screenshot)A criminal justice law the state legislature passed this year is likely to funnel more people into forced mental health treatment using a system that hospitals and former law enforcement officers say doesn’t work. 
That was the takeaway from the first meeting of the new state House Select Committee on Involuntary Commitment and Public Safety. Its task is to recommend changes to strengthen the state’s mental health system and involuntary commitment processes.
The committee was formed after the legislature passed Iryna’s Law in September in response to the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, in Charlotte. A man with a history of severe mental illness is charged with her death.
Iryna’s Law includes new procedures for magistrates that will likely result in more people suspected of having a mental illness being ordered by the court to be evaluated for mental health treatment. 
At its meeting Thursday, the panel heard from experts who explained that the mental health system is already overwhelmed, leaving some people stuck for weeks in hospital emergency departments with no mental health treatment and no access to a lawyer. 
Judicial officers, usually magistrates, order defendants to receive examinations for involuntary commitment, Mark Botts of the UNC School of Government explained. A law enforcement officer then transports the defendant to a hospital emergency department or crisis facility with commitment examiners. 
If the examiner determines involuntary commitment is appropriate, the search is on for an empty bed in a psychiatric hospital. The defendant is evaluated for a second time at the psychiatric hospital, and a Superior Court hearing is scheduled.
“It can take time to locate an inpatient psychiatric facility with the specialized treatment needed for that person’s condition,” said Johana Troccolli, system vice president for behavioral health at Duke University Health System. 
“The shortage of psychiatric beds, especially in specialty units, create bottlenecks that leave patients boarding in the EDs for days, weeks, and sometimes months,” she said. 
 The involuntary commitment petition expires in seven days if no hospital bed is found or if commitment is no longer appropriate. But magistrates can renew petitions repeatedly, leaving defendants stranded in general hospitals’ emergency departments without second evaluations or lawyers. 
There’s no good data on involuntary commitment, Botts told the committee, so it’s unclear how many people are ordered into treatment and how many must wait in emergency departments for psychiatric hospital beds. 
Emergency departments are not equipped to hold people who are violent or may have committed crimes, Troccoli said. Keeping people with mental illnesses in emergency departments is not safe for providers or patients, she said. 
House members who are former law enforcement officers also said transporting people from hospital to hospital takes considerable time away from other duties.
Rep. Reese Pyrtle (R-Rockingham), a former Eden police chief, said he had his department track the increased time officers spent in emergency departments over a dozen years or more. The department saw some of the same people repeatedly committed to treatment, he said. 
When people were released from the hospital, there was no way to make sure they were connected to a mental health mobile crisis unit, Pyrtle said. 
“Law enforcement and hospitals can’t say ‘no,’” Pyrtle said. “It’s disheartening because it means the consumer who needs the services is not getting them.”
Rep. Timothy Reeder (R-Pitt), a committee co-chairman and a medical doctor, said he wants a better system for evaluating patients and getting them treatment if they need it. 
“I hope we’re going to come up with a way to improve the system and not just put Band-Aids on the existing system, because what I think you’ve heard today is that the system is not functioning in a way that is efficient and effective,” Reeder said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-13-at-11.32.44-AM-e1763068717337-1024x499.png,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green’s decision to postpone the hearing and transfer the case to a new judge unleashed a storm of criticism of the new PAC, called Put Missouri First, and its attorney, Marc Ellinger.
“He’s trying to subvert justice and prejudice my client,” said Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing a PAC called People Not Politicians that is leading the referendum campaign. 
Ellinger said he can be ready quickly and because signatures are not due until Dec. 11, nothing crucial will happen before the case can get before a new judge. 
“There’s no urgency in getting a resolution on this case,” Ellinger said.
The postponement is the second delay in the case. Green became ill and was unable to convene a trial originally set for Nov. 3. 
Without his illness, Put Missouri First would have been too late to intervene. It was organized on Oct. 31 and did not receive any funding until Nov. 4, when the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Committee each donated $50,000.
Richard von Glahn, executive director of People Not Politicians, said after Thursday’s hearing that the move to slow down the case shows the GOP knows how unpopular the gerrymandered map is.
“It’s pretty easy to tell desperation when you see it,” von Glahn said. “What Mr. Ellinger did today shows that committee is simply desperate to not have the illegal and unpopular action that they took placed before Missouri voters.”
People Not Politicians must gather at least 106,134 signatures, spread over six of the state’s eight congressional districts, to trigger a referendum on the new congressional map approved on a party-line vote during a September special legislative session. The signatures must be turned in by Dec. 11.
The case postponed on Thursday is one of six — five in state courts, one in federal court — focused on the September special session. One case, challenging the authority for the special session, has been decided at the trial court level and is under appeal.
Another, questioning whether lawmakers had the power to revise districts without new census data, was heard on Wednesday. A hearing in the federal case, which attempts to win a decision that congressional redistricting maps are protected from citizen referendum petitions by the federal Constitution, is scheduled for Nov. 25 in St. Louis.
In the case postponed Thursday, People Not Politicians is arguing that the right to seek a referendum on any law is triggered when lawmakers take a final vote on a bill. The committee is suing Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who rejected petition forms because Gov. Mike Kehoe had not signed the redistricting legislation.
Kehoe called lawmakers into special session in September at the insistence of President Donald Trump in a bid to give Republicans seven instead of six of Missouri’s eight congressional seats.
Under the bill scheduled to take effect Dec. 12, Missourians would vote next year in revised districts. The new Missouri map targets the Kansas City-based 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, to flip to the Republican Party.
Trump wants to preserve and expand the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House, where they currently have a 219-213 edge.
The efforts to delay the petition drive will not succeed, von Glahn said. The campaign has collected more than 200,000 signatures, he said.
The case will preserve the rights of the 90,000 people who signed the petition between Sept. 15, when the first version was filed with Hoskins, and Oct. 14, he said. 
That is when Hoskins issued a news release warning that no signatures gathered before he certified the petition for circulation were valid and anyone who had signed it could be prosecuted for an election offense. Von Glahn said he wants a declaration from the court that those people have not done anything wrong.
“There is not a question that every single signature that has been gathered is on a form that the Secretary of State has himself said is the appropriate form,” he said.
The late intervention and delays are “ridiculous and they’re undemocratic,” Hatfield said. “If the Republican Party and the proponents think that redrawing Missouri’s congressional districts to go to a seven to one Republican is a great idea, then let’s vote on it and see whether it’s a good idea or not.”
In the petition seeking to intervene, Ellinger wrote that Put Missouri First will incur heavy expenses and time-consuming organizing efforts if the map is put to a vote. 
“The judge found it convincing and allowed us in the case,” Ellinger said “We have a vested interest in the expense of campaign funds and in the advocacy for or against a measure.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/von-Glahn-redistricting-11132025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)The South Dakota Department of Education deserves a failing grade, according to one of the lawmakers tasked with performance management reviews of state agencies.
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, called the department’s review the “worst performing report that we have” and said Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves faces an “uphill battle.”
The Legislature’s Government and Operations Audit Committee reviewed the report Thursday at the Capitol in Pierre. The report measures the department’s success at improving public school student performance against goals in reading and math proficiencies, attendance, Native American student success and college and workforce preparedness.
The department didn’t reach any of the report’s target performance outcomes in the last fiscal year.
For the past five years, the department hasn’t reached its target performance outcomes for reading proficiency, math proficiency, Native American student success or absenteeism. The last time the department met a target for college and career readiness was in fiscal year 2021.
English and language arts
The department measures third grade English and language arts proficiency rates and elementary and middle school state assessment growth rates.
The proficiency rate indicates what percentage of students can read at grade level, while the growth rate measures whether students will stay proficient later in their education.
During the 2024-2025 school year, just under 45% of students tested proficient in English and language arts. The department aimed for just under 55%.

When lawmakers pressed Graves about the gap in proficiency, he told lawmakers that South Dakota implements “really rigorous expectations” for proficiency, which can lead to lower scores.
The student growth rate was 56%, short of the 61% target.
Graves said he expects statewide implementation of the Science of Reading principles, which focus heavily on phonics, will improve student literacy rates and test scores in the coming years. The state Board of Education included the principles in revisions to English and language arts standards earlier this year.
Eighth grade math proficiency
The department’s math goals use eighth grade math proficiency rates on the state assessment and math growth rates for elementary and middle school students.
Nearly 42% of eighth graders tested proficient in math last school year, missing the 54% target. Students’ growth rate came in at just under 51%, under the 58% goal.
Despite that, Graves noted, South Dakota ranks sixth in the nation for math proficiency at the eighth grade level, based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. It ranks 17th for fourth grade proficiency.

The department proposed new math standards this year, meant to simplify what standards need to be taught — especially at the elementary school level. Some math educators are raising concerns that the changes oversimplify the standards, which could make it harder for teachers to know what exact mathematical skills students need to exhibit by the end of the year. The proposed standards are still under review.
Native American student success
Native Americans comprise the largest minority in South Dakota, and Native American students face some of the starkest disparities in academic achievement compared to their peers.
The third grade English and language arts proficiency rate among Native Americans last school year stood at 16%. Eighth grade math proficiency stood at 9%. Both goals were over 54%. 
Growth rates, graduate rates and college and career readiness among Native American students were also significantly below their targets.
Graves said he’d hoped a movement to introduce Education Savings Accounts in South Dakota would help educators to “innovate” and address the problems. But the measure, which would have provided public funding for private education and homeschool options, failed during the last legislative session.
Traditional solutions, Graves said, especially federal funding distributed to school districts serving high populations of Native American students, have “never achieved the kind of results we would hope for.”
South Dakota’s attendance rate stood at 88% of students attending at least 90% of enrolled days the last school year. Among Native American students, attendance has hovered between 50% and 60% during the last five years.

The state department awarded grants to several school districts across the state in 2024 to target absenteeism rates. While in their second year of the grant, Graves said some districts have seen “some improvement.” Overall, the progress is “disappointing.”
“We were hoping for a faster recovery and a greater improvement in attendance at this point in time,” Graves told lawmakers.
Graves added that he expects most of the attendance programs initiated because of the grants will go away once funding ends.
College and career readiness
The department also missed its targeted four-year graduate rate, math and English proficiency rates indicating college readiness, and workforce readiness rate targets. The outcomes were closer to their targets than in other areas of student achievement.
The department plans to use a “more comprehensive look” at college and workforce readiness measures in coming years, based on the report, rather than basing it only on test scores.
Graves highlighted a school program that works primarily with low-income or other marginalized groups of students to prepare students for postsecondary education or the workforce. About 99% of students involved in South Dakota Jobs for America’s Graduates chapters in the state graduated from high school. About 98% of program graduates in 2024 went on to attend college or technical schools. The other 2% were enrolled in a certificate program or Job Corps training.
But the program includes “considerable expense at the state and local level” to implement, which limits what schools take part. He added that the state is seeking sponsorships to grow the program.
“I’m convinced that it could really balloon in South Dakota,” Graves said.

(Illustration courtesy of Getty Images)A federal judge on Monday permanently ended the Satanic Temple’s challenge to Idaho’s abortion laws. 
Chief U.S. District of Idaho Judge David Nye dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought back or amended, agreeing with earlier rulings that the Satanic Temple lacked standing to challenge the law and that the arguments “lack merit and could not be saved by any amendment.” 
“Idaho’s pro-life laws protect both mothers and unborn children, and this decision confirms those protections are constitutionally sound,” Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a press release. “The Satanic Temple’s attempt to manufacture constitutional violations out of disagreement with Idaho’s values has been rejected at every level. We’ve defended Idaho’s laws through every stage of this litigation, and we will continue protecting the right of Idaho’s elected representatives to defend life.”
The Satanic Temple is an association that says it “venerates, but does not worship, the allegorical Satan described in the epic poem ‘Paradise Lost’ — the defender of personal sovereignty against the dictates of religious authority.” The group first challenged Idaho’s abortion bans in 2022. 
The Idaho Legislature had approved a “trigger law,” that went into effect upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and another law that allowed civil lawsuits to be brought against abortion providers by family members of the fetus. 
The organization argued the laws, which provide narrow exemptions for rape and incest, were unconstitutional violations of property rights, the equal protection clause, religious freedom and involuntary servitude. 
The federal district court already dismissed the case for lack of standing, as the Temple could not show its members were harmed by the laws. The Temple appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which agreed with the lower court dismissal. However, the Ninth Circuit panel of judges wrote that in order to dismiss the case with prejudice, the court must evaluate if the Temple’s claims could be saved by amendment. 
The panel sent the case back to the district court judge, and Nye again held that the Satanic Temple lacked legal standing and “no amendment could save” the Temple’s claims. 
The Satanic Temple argued that the court never really gave its legal claims proper consideration. To continue to challenge the law, the organization would need to file a new complaint with the court, starting over with a new case. 
“The judge is overselling the dismissal in an attempt to sound as if the court taking a bold position,” said Lucien Greaves, cofounder and spokesperson for The Satanic Temple, in an email, “perhaps in an attempt to cover for the fact that their dismissal was a cowardly punt that refused to examine the legal merits of our claim, in favor of denying us standing.” 
“Or perhaps they are trying to convince us that we truly can not contest their abortion restrictions again for fear that the law is on our side. The fact is, when we have a pregnant plaintiff, we will refile a claim, and this time the courts should have no excuse but to do their job, which they so desperately avoid.”

But the agency did stop ramping up the percentage of those affected. The FAA started by asking airlines to cancel 4% of flights Nov. 7. A Wednesday order halted the rate at 6%.That was enough to cause major disruptions to travel, and it remained unclear Thursday how long it would take to resume normal operations. In a statement, Airlines for America, the trade group representing the nation’s commercial air carriers, welcomed the end of the shutdown but was vague about how much longer air travelers would see disruptions. The statement noted the upcoming holiday as a possible milestone. “When the FAA gives airlines clearance to return to full capacity, our crews will work quickly to ramp up operations especially with Thanksgiving holiday travel beginning next week,” the group’s statement said. The FAA and Transportation Department did not return messages seeking updates Thursday.The reduction in flights was meant to ease pressure on air traffic controllers, who worked through the shutdown without pay. Many missed work as they pursued short-term jobs in other industries. Duffy said that left the controllers on the job overstressed and possibly prone to costly mistakes.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sought to reward other federal workers at airports, those employed by her department’s Transportation Security Administration, with $10,000 bonuses if they maintained high attendance records during the shutdown.Noem handed out checks to TSA workers in Houston on Thursday and said more could come. Federal workers return, with back pay on the wayHundreds of thousands of federal workers who had been furloughed returned to the office Thursday and those who had been working without pay will continue their duties knowing their next paycheck should be on time. All workers will receive back pay for the shutdown, in accordance with a 2019 law that states employees “shall be paid for such work, at the employee’s standard rate of pay, at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations, regardless of scheduled pay dates.”A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the White House has urged agencies to get back pay to employees “expeditiously and accurately.”Agencies will need to submit time and attendance files, and payroll processors can then issue checks. According to the spokesperson, agencies have different pay schedules and payroll processors, and “discrepancies in timing and pay periods are a result of that.”The office estimates that workers will receive a “supercheck” for the pay period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1 on the following dates:Nov. 15General Services AdministrationOffice of Personnel ManagementNov. 16Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and DefenseNov. 17Departments of Education, State, Interior and TransportationEnvironmental Protection AgencyNASANational Science FoundationNuclear Regulatory CommissionSocial Security AdministrationNov. 19Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor and TreasurySmall Business AdministrationDoreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement Wednesday that federal workers across all agencies “should not have to wait another minute longer for the paychecks they lost during the longest government shutdown in history.” “The anxiety has been devastating as they cut back on spending, ran up credit card debt, took out emergency loans, filed for unemployment, found temporary side jobs, stood in line for food assistance, skipped filling prescriptions and worried about the future. Federal employees should receive the six weeks of back pay they are owed immediately upon the reopening of the federal government,” said Greenwald. The union represents workers at 38 federal agencies and offices.States Newsroom spoke to several furloughed federal workers who attended a special food distribution event during the shutdown.The American Federation of Government Employees, one of multiple unions that sued the Trump administration over layoffs during the shutdown, said its members were used “as leverage to advance political priorities,” according to a statement issued Tuesday by the union’s national president, Everett Kelley.The AFGE, which according to the union represents roughly 820,000 federal workers, did not immediately respond for comment Thursday.The shutdown-ending deal reinstated jobs for fired federal employees and prohibits any reductions in force by the administration until Jan. 30.Federal workers speak outA statement released Thursday by a group of federal workers across agencies struck a different tone on the shutdown and praised the 40 senators and 209 representatives who voted against the temporary spending bill deal.“The fight mattered. It changed the conversation. More members of the American public now understand that Trump is shredding the Constitution,” according to the statement issued by the Civil Servants Coalition.The coalition also noted, “Even though the government is reopening, none of us will be able to fully deliver our agency’s missions. Our work has been exploited and dismantled since January through harmful policies and illegal purges of critical staff.”The group emailed the statement as a PDF document to an unknown number of government workers and urged them to “channel that frustration toward action” by contacting their representatives.SNAP saga concludesThe government reopening ended a drawn-out saga over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps 42 million people afford groceries. The U.S.Department of Agriculture told states in a Thursday memo they “must take immediate steps to ensure households receive their full November allotments promptly.”The guidance also noted that states should prepare for another shutdown as soon as next October by upgrading systems so that they could allow for partial payments. A key point of dispute between the administration and those seeking SNAP benefits was the lengthy time the administration said it would take to fund partial benefits. A Wednesday evening statement from a department spokesperson said full benefits would be disbursed in most states by Thursday night. Lauren Kallins, a senior legislative director for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said Thursday “states are all working hard to resume full benefits.” “But there will likely be logistical challenges, depending on a state’s system’s capabilities and whether the state had already issued partial benefits, that may impact how quickly a state is able to push out” benefits, she wrote. The program, which is funded by the federal government and administered by states, sends monthly payments on a rolling basis. That means that the day of the month each household receives its allotment varies. Households that usually receive benefits mid-month or later should see no interruption. But many of the program’s beneficiaries receive their payments earlier in the month, meaning that, depending on their state, they may have missed their November payments. Some states, including Democrat-run Wisconsin, Oregon and Michigan, began paying full benefits last week after a Rhode Island federal judge ordered the administration to release full November payments and the department issued guidance to states to do so.The administration then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to pause enforcement of the Rhode Island judge’s order and reversed its guidance to states, telling them to “immediately undo” efforts to pay out full November benefits.The Department of Justice dropped its Supreme Court case Thursday. “Because the underlying dispute here is now moot, the government withdraws its November 7 stay application in this Court,” U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote to the high court.In the trial court, the administration cited the USDA guidance and said it would discuss the future of the litigation with the coalition of cities and nonprofit groups that brought the suit. Capital area tourist attractions reopenTourists in the nation’s capital have been shut out of the Smithsonian Institution’s 17 free museums and zoo for most of the federal shutdown.The institution on Friday will open the National Museum of American History, the National Air and Space Museum and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Air and Space Museum located at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, according to a message posted on the Smithsonian’s website.All other museums and the National Zoo will open on a “rolling basis” by Nov. 17.Multiple public-facing agencies, including the National Park Service and Internal Revenue Service, did not respond to States Newsroom’s requests for reopening information.National parks were closed or partially closed during the shutdown.Several IRS services were reduced or altogether cut as the funding lapse dragged on.

Her monthly premium is rising from $20 to $75 — a nearly fourfold increase — and she doesn’t know what she will do.
The 48-year-old from Yazoo City, who is being identified by her middle name due to privacy concerns and fear of retaliation, has chronic kidney failure, high blood pressure and fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes widespread body pain and fatigue. She does not work due to her health issues and the responsibility of caring for three children under the age of four. 
“I’ve got to have something, and I don’t know what I’m going to do at this moment,” Marie said. “Today, I can’t tell you what I’m going to do.”
Marie is one of hundreds of thousands of Mississippians facing increasing health insurance prices next year. Premiums for Affordable Care Act Marketplace plans are set to rise in January if Congress does not act to extend the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for over 22 million Americans. Consumers will pay more than double on average, according to KFF, though the rate changes will vary based on age, income and location. 
About 200,000 Mississippians are expected to drop their Marketplace coverage if the increased subsidies are not extended, Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney told Mississippi Today. It is projected to be one of the steepest drop offs in health coverage among all states. 
The Marketplace primarily insures people who do not have health coverage through their employer, Medicare or Medicaid, and about half of them are small business owners, employees, or self-employed.
For a 40-year old living alone in Jackson and making $30,000 annually, the estimated cost of monthly premiums for a silver health insurance plan would rise more than $100, from $42 to $155 per month, KFF estimates show. Such a person would still receive $483 in monthly standard federal tax credits, first made available in 2014 through the Affordable Care Act for people who make between $15,650 and $62,600. 
The enhanced subsidies were an added boost authorized by Congress in 2021 that raised the income ceiling for eligibility and allowed low-income households to access insurance without paying premiums during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As a result, the number of Mississippians enrolled in Marketplace health insurance tripled, rising by over 200,000 people between 2021 and 2025, according to enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the same period, the number of people without insurance – one of the highest rates in the country – dropped several percentage points.
A disagreement over extending the increased subsidies was at the heart of the 43-day federal government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — that ended Wednesday night, with Democrats pushing for their renewal. Democratic leaders in Congress have vowed to continue fighting to extend the subsidies, and Republicans have promised to hold a vote on their extension by mid-December. 
Insurance Commissioner Chaney told Mississippi Today he believes the enhanced tax credits should be phased out, but more gently than ending suddenly at the close of the year.
“We cannot continue to give people free health care, free food, free everything and have a very small number pay for it,” he said. “People have to have some skin in the game to make the system work.”
Marie was one of the Mississippians who benefited from the new, enhanced tax credits in 2021. For the last three years, she has paid a $20 monthly premium for Marketplace insurance, making it possible for her to afford regular appointments and bloodwork to monitor her kidney condition and the costs of her medications. 
But Marie said she and her husband, who works, can’t afford the higher price tag, nor can they pay the out-of-pocket costs of her care if she turns down coverage. 
“If I don’t have my blood pressure medicine, that’s going to be bad,” she said. “I probably won’t live long.”
Experts warn that more people going without health insurance coverage could have serious consequences not only for those individuals but also for other consumers and hospitals. 
Healthy consumers who can go without coverage are the most likely to drop coverage, a shift that is likely to drive up Marketplace premiums overall, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. As healthier enrollees leave, the remaining customer base, called the “risk pool,” will become sicker on average and more expensive to insure. 
This is already reflected in next year’s rates. Marketplace insurers told regulators they plan to raise premiums by about 4 percentage points more on average in 2026 to offset the loss of healthier customers, KFF reported. They are also raising prices to keep pace with rising medical costs.
Corlette said she expects prices to rise further in 2027 if the subsidies are not extended. 
“It takes a while for these changes to ripple through the system,” she said.

If tens of thousands of Mississippians drop insurance coverage, hospitals will be likely to shoulder the costs of caring for uninsured patients when they turn to emergency rooms as a last resort, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association. 
Mississippi’s rural hospitals will lose about $200 million in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies are not extended, according to projections from the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health care access in the U.S. More than half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are already at risk of closing, according to one recent report.
And hospitals across the state are already anticipating cuts to Medicaid payments beginning in 2029 as a result of a sweeping tax-and-spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer. Paired with rising uncompensated care costs, those reductions will strain hospitals’ bottom line, Roberson said. 
“At some point, it’s not going to be sustainable for hospitals,” he said.
The new law that reduces Medicaid funding also imposes new verification requirements for people receiving standard tax credits. This creates added red tape that produces “more friction for people,” and may drive younger, healthier people to not enroll in plans to avoid the hassle, Corlette said. 
Open enrollment for Marketplace health insurance plans began Nov. 1, giving Americans the first look at their premiums next year. The deadline to enroll in insurance to start in January is Dec. 15, 2025.
If you plan to purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace for 2026, experts recommend these tips:  

Review your premiums early – Check your insurance premiums as soon as possible to allow time to make arrangements for next year. Estimated prices for 2026 plans are now available on HealthCare.gov.
Beware of misleading products – Be cautious if you’re considering buying coverage outside of HealthCare.gov. Some companies may use aggressive or deceptive marketing to sell alternatives to traditional insurance that provide customers limited protection, said Corlette. Plans such as short-term limited duration, fixed indemnity, health care sharing ministries, and Farm Bureau health plans, could expose customers to financial risks, she said, so it’s important to research carefully before purchasing. 
Seek help – If you’re facing significant premium increases or need assistance navigating the Marketplace, contact Help Health Mississippi, a free service operated by the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, said program manager Khaylah Scott. The program’s website is helphealthms.org and its toll-free number is 1-877-314-3843.

Time is running out for Congress to extend the increased subsidies, Corlette said, noting that customers could be deterred by higher prices and opt not to renew their coverage for next year, on top of the back-end system changes that would take time to implement.
“The later we get, the harder it gets,” she said. 
For consumers with a month and a half left to decide what to do about their coverage, the timeline is daunting. 
“It’s overwhelming,” said Marie, who said she plans to reach out to her health insurance plan for help and explore the possibility of Medicaid coverage as the end of the year nears. 
She is also turning to prayer. 
“I pray a lot,” Marie said. “And we are going to keep praying because that’s the way things got to be.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06074651/medical-debt-past-due-shutterstock.jpg,,,2025-11-13 17:57:05.311569

State Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, received $4,100 in contributions on Wednesday — much of which came from lobbyists representing the state’s energy interests. 
The donations were posted on the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance website on the same day that Cusack’s legislation that would weaken the state’s 2030 climate mandates advanced out of committee as it moves quickly through the House. 
In all, 11 lobbyists, consultants, and attorneys either representing or working directly for energy companies, including National Grid, Unitil, and Liberty Utilities — in addition to oil giant Exxon and Avangrid, which co-owns the Vineyard Wind offshore wind project currently in operation and owns Berkshire Gas — contributed a total of $2,400 to Cusack’s campaign account. 
Jason Tait, a spokesperson for OCPF, said the November 12 transaction date reflects when the money was deposited into Cusack’s campaign account, not necessarily when the donation was made, but that contributions must be deposited within seven days of receipt. CommonWealth Beacon first reported the news of Cusack’s legislative push on November 7. The OCPF deposit report on November 12 was his fourth-largest of the year and largest since May. 
Cusack declined to comment.  
His legislation would lower the amount of renewable energy the utilities would be required to purchase and cut the state’s energy efficiency initiative, which is funded through the utilities’ ratepayers, by $500 million. It would also codify Gov. Maura Healey’s request to delay a state mandate to procure offshore wind from 2027 to 2029. 
Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science at Northeastern University, said Cusack’s haul is a “fairly significant number for a single day for a state legislator,” but that there’s nothing out of the ordinary regarding the contributions.  
“This is exactly what lobbyists do,” he said. “They try to influence legislators to support their causes in part by contributing financially to their campaign coffers, especially legislators who are in committee assignments that can be helpful to them or can otherwise help them advance an agenda. Utility companies have historically been involved in lobbying efforts and use their resources strategically to try to advance their goals.” 
While individuals can donate up to $1,000 per calendar year to a candidate, lobbyists are restricted to donations of no more than $200. None of the lobbyists whose donations were reported on Wednesday gave more than $200.  
Robert Boatright, professor of political science at Clark University, said the lobbyist contributions are “clearly a sign that they’re happy with” Cusack” – but that the donations aren’t necessarily surprising. 
Amanda Vicinanzo, a spokesperson for Unitil, said in a statement that individual contributions by lobbyists or employees are “personal decisions and do not reflect Unitil’s position on any legislation” and that the company is “currently in the process of reviewing” Cusack’s bill. 
“Broadly speaking, we support initiatives that help make energy more affordable and reliable for all customers,” she said. 
Brendan Moss, a spokesperson for National Grid, said that the company “welcomes the opportunity to engage constructively with policymakers on practical solutions to support households and businesses.” 
Some of the lobbyists aren’t employed by utilities but work at lobby firms that represent the utility companies, including Tremont Strategies Group and Smith, Costello & Crawford Public Policy Group. Neither of those companies responded to requests for comment. 
Cusack’s haul represents about 10 percent of the total $39,000 in cash he has on hand, according to OCPF.  
His legislation has the support of the Mass Coalition for Sustainable Energy, which includes groups like the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, local chambers of commerce, and the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council.  
Environmental groups, meanwhile, are fiercely opposed. Cusack appears mindful of the pushback against his effort, writing to House members on Wednesday that he is “aware that many of you are hearing from your constituents and some activists about this affordability bill,” according to an email viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — With the federal government now re-opened, Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services has resumed distribution of food assistance.
DHHS announced Thursday that it had distributed “partial” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits — or SNAP — to Nebraska participants for November. The maximum allotment per household is 65% of the maximum monthly allotment, which could be scaled down based on income, according to the department’s website.
Federally funded SNAP benefits were in limbo during the 43-day government shutdown that came to a close Wednesday after President Donald Trump signed a resolution funding the government through Jan. 30. Federal officials claimed that roughly half of November’s SNAP benefits were still being distributed, but the timeline of that distribution was murky.
The shutdown, which started when Congress failed to pass annual spending laws by Oct. 1, left SNAP without any appropriated funding for November and beyond. A number of lawsuits left the nature of the payments unclear. In Nebraska, about 150,000 low-income and eligible participants, including children, participate in SNAP.
Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear at multiple points during the shutdown that the state would not fund Nebraska’s SNAP program in the meantime.
“Nobody’s going to go hungry,” Pillen said at a Nov. 6 news conference. “We have extraordinary services, from food pantries to engage churches and services across the state.”
DHHS Economic Assistance Director Shannon Grotrian said soon after the shutdown ended that department officials began talks with federal officials to reestablish the benefits.
“After guidance was received from the USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] authorizing partial issuances, the team immediately worked to ensure these payments were issued as soon as possible,” Grotrian said.
Statewide advocacy group Nebraska Appleseed criticized the Trump administration for not funding SNAP during the shutdown.
In a separate press release Wednesday, Eric Savaiano, Nebraska Appleseed’s Food and Nutrition Access Program Manager, claimed the administration could have used its transfer authority to keep the program running.
“Food should not be used as a political tool, and we are glad this unnecessary food crisis is over for now,” Savaiano said.

Frank)The federal government last week said it will not release a National Wolf Recovery Plan, despite announcing a plan was in the works last year, saying the species doesn’t need federal protection.  
The move by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service comes as members of Congress are considering multiple bills that would delist the species from the Endangered Species Act nationwide. 
Wolves in the United States are grouped into three differently-managed groups. 
In the Northern Rockies — Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and parts of Washington and Oregon — wolves were removed from the endangered species list and are managed by their respective state wildlife agencies, which allow hunting. 
A population of wolves in Minnesota are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, while wolves in the remaining 44 U.S. states are listed as endangered species.

Under the first Trump administration in 2020, the USFWS had decided to delist gray wolves in the states outside of the northern Rockies where they are protected by the Endangered Species Act. But a federal judge in California reversed that decision in February 2022.
Under the new gray wolf “Recovery Planning Exception Findings,” released last week, the USFWS states that no recovery plan is needed because the species no longer meets ESA requirements. 
“The Service’s most recent status reviews for listed gray wolves determined that neither listed entity (44-State or MN entities) meet the definitions of a threatened species or endangered species under the Act according to the best scientific and commercial data available,” according to the Service. “Both listed gray wolf entities are no longer in need of conservation under the Act due to recovery. We therefore conclude that recovery plans for these two entities would not promote their conservation.”
The decision not to release a recovery plan is based on the 2020 status review that was later reversed in 2022. 
After the federal government cleared the way for wolves to be removed from the Endangered Species Act in 2020, a three-day hunt in Wisconsin killed 216 wolves, nearly twice the quota allowed by the state. 
Several conservation groups, which led the lawsuits against the 2020 decision, decried the latest move by the federal government and said they would once again go to court. 
“I’m appalled that Trump wants to strip gray wolves of federal protections and turn their management over to states that are dead set on killing them,” said Collette Adkins, senior attorney and Carnivore Conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Courts have repeatedly made it clear that our country’s gray wolves have not recovered in places like the southern Rocky Mountains and West Coast. We’ll challenge the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to once again abandon wolf recovery, and we’ll win.”
  Montana’s wolves in court 

Montana’s wolf hunting season is currently underway with new state regulations that allow for hunters and trappers to kill 458 wolves. Another 100 wolves can be killed in management actions by wildlife officials. 
But two opposing groups have filed lawsuits against the state over the new regulations. 
A pair of Republican lawmakers and the Outdoor Heritage Coalition allege that the Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sets policies and regulations for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, didn’t comply with state laws intended to reduce the state’s population of gray wolves, saying the quota is too low. 
On the other side, four conservation organizations filed suit also in hopes of overturning the latest wolf management regulations, but with an opposing argument — that the decision to increase the quota of wolves that can be killed this year threatens the species and flies in the face of the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.
A half-day of arguments will take place before Lewis and Clark District Court on Nov. 14. 
The conservation groups are seeking a preliminary injunction which would void this year’s wolf hunting regulations. 
According to FWP’s wolf harvest dashboard, 62 wolves have been harvested since the general hunting season opened on Sept. 15. The state’s trapping season begins Dec. 1 and runs through March 15, 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/c1db5324-7bad-486b-b315-ba31fa7034b9Original-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Seton Hall University must disclose a litany of documents to attorneys suing the Archdiocese of Newark over its handling of sexual abuse claims, a Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday.
Judge Avion Benjamin’s order will force the university to disclose more than 20,000 pages of documents to opposing counsel, including documents from a 2019 outside probe into abuse allegations at the school’s seminary and whether Monsignor Joseph R. Reilly, the university’s president and a former seminary dean, properly reported them.
“These documents are going to reveal additional examples of systemic behavior within both the archdiocese and Seton Hall where these institutions failed to discipline priests accused of sexual abuse and ratified a culture that turned a blind eye to perpetrators who preyed on these vulnerable children,” said John Baldante, one of the plaintiffs’ lead attorneys.
Benjamin’s order, delivered verbally over about an hour Wednesday, would see the outside report released with some conclusions redacted and directs the university to hand over a trove of emails between it and the law firm that conducted the investigation.
Some emails that included the university, its lawyers, and the investigators could be redacted or withheld based on attorney-client privilege based on the judge’s order, said Baldante, whose firm represents about a third of plaintiffs in the consolidated case.
The judge’s order requires Seton Hall to produce the documents within 30 days, though the disclosures could be paused if the school or the archdiocese appeals the ruling.
Spokespeople for the university and church did not immediately return requests for comment. Baldante said Seton Hall has already indicated it would appeal.
Attorneys for the university had argued the report and related documents were shielded by attorney-client privilege, arguing they were drafted to help prepare the school for litigation. But the judge found the report included a disclaimer that said Seton Hall was not a client of the law firm that drafted it.
In 2020, a judge overseeing the case ordered the archdiocese to disclose a slew of documents in response to claims by roughly 400 plaintiffs who alleged they were sexually abused by Newark’s Catholic clergy.
But the Seton Hall report was never handed over. Attorneys for plaintiffs have said they did not become aware of the investigation until a February report in Politico New Jersey revealed its existence.
Seton Hall attorneys charged that the 2020 order did not apply to the university, which was named in six of the cases. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued the Catholic university was part of the archdiocese and required to comply.

Wednesday, leaders of a key budget committee told Knuffman to rework his tuition recommendations for 2026-27 and remove a 3% increase for in-state undergrads. But at the full UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees meeting Thursday, Knuffman again presented his original proposal.
“Thanks for the robust discussion,” said Knuffman, standing firm. “We have considered that feedback, and we’d like this body to reconsider the tuition and fee proposal that we put forward yesterday.”
Knuffman’s recommendation, which was ultimately adopted in a split vote, includes undergraduate tuition increases of 3% for in-state students and 10% for out-of-state undergrads. Graduate campus-based tuition would see no change. The university will also move ahead with a 3% increase in student fees ($53 more per student), a 7% hike in housing and a 3.9% boost for on-campus dining prices.
Knuffman said raising in-state tuition, which drew the most opposition, was necessary.
“We remain concerned about the dynamic where UNC Chapel Hill is requesting a sizable level of enrollment dollars, north of $15 million from the legislature, yet we’re not using all the options available to us to generate additional dollars,” Knuffman explained.
Trustee Marty Kotis, who chairs the university board’s Budget, Finance, and Infrastructure Committee, was not happy.
Kotis reiterated that the North Carolina Constitution requires UNC to provide education to North Carolinians free of expense, as far as practical.

“This makes affordability for North Carolina residents a constitutional mandate, not a policy preference,” said Kotis.
Kotis proposed leaving in-state undergraduate tuition flat and finding the needed revenue by increasing tuition on out-of-state graduate students.
Trustee Jim Blaine went a step further, pointedly asking Chancellor Lee Roberts to justify how the university would spend the $800,000 that would be generated by a 3% tuition increase for North Carolinians.
“We have significant strategic priorities including the master plan for the campus,” answered Roberts.
“I don’t think that that’s much of an answer,” responded Blaine. “This is the easy button. This is the lazy way.”

Blaine said the university was not operating at maximum efficiency. He said leaders could find $800,000 elsewhere in a $4 billion budget without hitting North Carolina students and families.
Trustee Vinay Patel said when he was first appointed to the board of trustees in 2021, there was great ‘heartache’ over increasing out-of-state tuition by one or two percent.
“Here we are talking about a 10% increase to that number four years later. So that easy button has been pushed quite a bit,” said Patel.
At the same time, Patel agreed the university would be hard-pressed to get more money from the General Assembly when they did not use the tuition increase granted in September by the UNC Board of Governors.
UNC-Chapel Hill trustee Jennifer Lloyd argued that the desire to keep in-state tuition flat for undergraduates was honorable and admirable, but not realistic. (Screengrab: UNC-CH video stream)
Trustee Jennifer Lloyd said UNC-Chapel Hill has consistently been ranked as a best value among colleges and universities, but it was time to generate revenue.
“Why do we tolerate being so much less expensive than anyone but the University of Florida, while we continue to tolerate the deficiencies in the services that we provide?” asked Lloyd, who has had five children attend UNC-Chapel Hill.
“One thing I’ve noted about government is once you turn on the faucet to increase, it never stops,” argued Patrick Ballantine, a former state senator. “For now, I think it’s important to keep this faucet off for in-state residents.”
Lloyd said the desire to keep tuition flat for in-state undergraduates was honorable and admirable, but not realistic.

“We need to raise more revenue in any reasonable place we can,” said Lloyd. “We have tolerated an accumulated balance of deferred maintenance that we shouldn’t be tolerating. So, I’m going to stand behind the chancellor’s recommendation.”
With four trustees absent, Kotis recommended the decision be postponed until the full board could vote by paper ballot.
The trustees who were present rejected Kotis’s motion to delay the matter further, ultimately passing the tuition increase on a 6-5 vote.
The 3% increase amounts to a $211 bump per year and brings the annual cost of tuition and fees to $9,360 for incoming in-state undergraduates at UNC-Chapel Hill starting next year, if the UNC System agrees.

Five Democratic senators broke with their party on Wednesday to pass a continuing resolution with the Republican majority, and the House voted Wednesday evening with six Democrats and two Republicans cross the aisle.
All four members of Montana’s all-Republican federal delegation voted to end the shutdown.
“After 43 long days our government is finally open. I’m thankful for Democrats who joined with us in the Senate and voted for our bill and I’m grateful for Speaker Johnson’s leadership getting it passed quickly in the House with a strong bipartisan vote,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a social media post. “One thing’s clear: there’s nothing gained from shutdowns. They start with a bang and they end with a whimper. They don’t do anything but make life difficult for millions of Americans. The political theater we just witnessed should never be repeated.”
“I sincerely want to thank the handful of Democrats who had the political courage to cross the aisle and vote with us to end this embarrassing shutdown,” Sen. Tim Sheehy said on X. “Getting government operations opened up is the right thing to do for America, regardless of party. Let’s get to work.”
“Shutdowns are bad for America and bad for Montana. I voted to prevent this shutdown in September, and I gladly voted to end it today,” Rep. Ryan Zinke, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a press release. “This package is a good, bipartisan, solution, and I fought to make sure it includes real wins for our state, from funding fire departments in Ronan and Powell County to providing certainty for rural communities that depend on reliable government services. Congress has come together, and I urge the President to sign this bill so we can keep our government open and get back to working for the American people.”
“After more than 42 days, Congress has finally reopened the government. With the Senate’s amendments to our clean CR passed, Americans across the country who have been deprived of nutritional assistance, critical programs, or their paychecks will no longer face the hardship and uncertainty brought on by this shutdown. This is a good thing,” Rep. Troy Downing said in a press release. “If we want to prevent something like this from happening in the future, we cannot forget how we got here. Democrats voted for more than 6 weeks—that’s 42 days or 1008 hours—to keep our government closed while Americans suffered. And for what? We are functionally very near where we would have been had we passed the House’s September CR.
“I’m proud that I cast my vote to keep the government open then and now. Let this saga be a stark reminder of the consequences of brinksmanship and the real damage that’s done when one side of the aisle puts politics before people. Now, it’s time for Congress to pass our remaining appropriations bills and return to regular order.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1227909097-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Westend61/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s cuts to federal research funding have left projects at New Mexico’s institutions of higher education in limbo and have impacted innovation; economic development; workforce growth; and rural and tribal communities, according to a university research expert.
Members of the New Mexico Legislature’s interim Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee met in Santa Fe Wednesday where they heard from Lique Coolen, vice president for research for New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. Coolen’s presentation highlighted the uncertainty ongoing cancellations of funding awards to research institutions have created, and the possibility of fewer future funding opportunities. 
Coolen said that based on recent New Mexico Higher Education Department data, the state faces a loss of $95 million in federal funding for research alone. Key areas of research in the state include agriculture; defense and national security; public health; water resource and technology; energy initiatives; and others, Coolen noted.
One recent example of funding cuts, according to Coolen’s presentation, includes about $41.5 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to New Mexico Tech for the Four Corners Carbon Storage Hub. The project involved long-term carbon storage options for the Navajo Nation Four Corners power plant. A funding award of $10 million to New Mexico State University from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier in 2025 halted the South Central Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Center. The program involves five states, including New Mexico, and supports rural, tribal and underserved communities in competing for federal and state funding for quality of life and infrastructure needs. 
The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center lost nearly $1 million in federal funding from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency to support research on the “rapid identification of virus particles” by using artificial intelligence.
“This causes a huge amount of uncertainty for us universities,” Coolen said during the meeting. “Not only do we need to find other sources of funding to make sure that we do not have to lay off people, that we retain our workforce and most importantly, that we can continue to support the students that are supported by those federal funding sources. But this is not where it ends.”
Coolen described initial cuts to funding as the “first wave,” with the ripple effect leading to larger impacts in the future. She said grants that were once awarded could be canceled or not renewed; specific funding opportunities may become unavailable altogether; and universities may need to make cuts to lower facility and administration costs. She said this all has a negative impact on the state’s workforce pipeline, which relies on keeping New Mexico students in New Mexico once they complete their education.
“It’s also having an impact on students that are considering entering PhD programs where they may be dependent on federal funding for their research projects,” Coolen said. “I just had a conversation just this week with a student who is completing their master’s program, is really considering moving into a PhD program based on the research that they were doing in their laboratory, but now the federal funding has been cut. They do not know yet where to move next.”
She added that New Mexico Tech decreased the number of proposals submitted to various agencies to 60% or 65% of previous proposals for federal funding because the opportunities are not available. 
Coolen said universities are also seeing federal funding agencies changing their priorities to narrower “mission areas” with which the universities are not fully aligned or prepared to apply for. Large funding cuts to the U.S. National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health U.S. Department of Energy and others are expected, Coolen said, and range within 20% to 40% reductions in research funding.
“Universities are seeking ways to protect their programs that are critical to New Mexico, and are exploring mechanisms to enhance alignment with the federal priorities to remain competitive,” she said. 
Coolen told lawmakers that New Mexico research institutions need to align research with federal priorities while still serving the state, diversify research funding sources, increase collaborations with national laboratories and modernize infrastructure to maintain “top-level” research and retain talent. She encouraged lawmakers to consider where they might increase state investments to support the needs of the various research institutions.
Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque) pointed to larger research universities around the country that have been pressured by the Trump Administration to “conform” to executive mandates and threats of withholding federal funding, and questioned whether New Mexico universities have received similar pressure. 
“Cornell, University of Virginia, Brown, Columbia – they’re all giving in to demands and paying millions of dollars,” Garratt said during the meeting. Coolen said the universities in New Mexico have not received such direct communication, but are reviewing the actions taken by other higher education institutions.
Rep. Alan Martinez (R-Rio Rancho) said he was not necessarily worried about New Mexico universities becoming at-risk of losing federal funds due to demands by the Trump Administration, but called for cutting the “nonsense of fighting against the president.” 
“I just don’t see the wisdom in wasting time fighting against the president instead of fighting for the State of New Mexico,” Martinez said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1011456596-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolinians who missed out on their grocery assistance for November should receive their benefits Friday, according to the state Department of Social Services.
More than 176,000 households in the state didn’t get their food benefits this month because of a 43-day federal shutdown that ended late Wednesday night. After funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program stopped Nov. 1, states scrambled to figure out how to feed millions of low-income people who usually rely on the benefits, commonly called food stamps.
Because South Carolina distributes SNAP benefits on a rolling basis, the shutdown didn’t block aid to all of the nearly 550,000 people the program helps feed.
For the roughly 64,700 households who usually get their benefits between the 15th and the 19th of each month, money to their debit cards will be downloaded on their usual schedule, DSS said in a Thursday news release.


Everyone else in the program, including those newly approved for benefits after Oct. 15, should get their November allotment Friday. Altogether, around $105 million in benefits are downloaded onto cards each month, according to DSS.
The law President Donald Trump signed Wednesday ending the shutdown included funding for the program through Sept. 30, 2026.
Until all SNAP recipients have received their benefits, the state’s donation-supported emergency response fund will continue to accept money, said Georgia Mjartan, president of Central Carolina Community Foundation, which runs the One SC Fund. Gov. Henry McMaster announced the fund’s activation Oct. 28, ahead of the looming Nov. 1 shutdown, to help food banks stock their shelves.
“The need is still there, because people don’t actually have SNAP loaded back onto their cards yet,” Mjartan said Thursday. “It’s not just a snap of the fingers and then their funds are available.”
Since its activation Oct. 28, the fund collected $326,654 from 680 separate donors, Mjartan said. With several more large donations incoming, Mjartan expects the fund to reach $400,000 by early next week at the latest, she said.
The fund sent an initial $200,000 last week to four regional food banks with reach across the state. With SNAP benefits returning, the fund will distribute the rest of the money raised.
Although donations fell far short of the millions of dollars officials hoped to see, the fund received money from a record-breaking number of donors, Mjartan said.
Among them were children who wrote that they were donating their allowances to keep fellow children from going hungry, elderly couples scraping together what they could to help out, and some recurring donors who gave more than $10,000, she said.
SC activates disaster relief fund, State Guard to help food banks as federal aid run out

“It’s been really overwhelming to see how individuals really responded to this very human need of their neighbors, and that has been one of the brightest spots,” Mjartan said.
Unlike after natural disasters, companies and foundations were more hesitant to donate, seemingly out of fear their money wouldn’t make a major difference, Mjartan said.
The fund did get $100,000 from Duke Energy soon after activating, as well as more than $50,000 from WoodmenLife Outreach Foundation, the philanthropic arm of an insurance company. Several more companies said they would make donations in the coming days, she said.
More companies and people likely found other ways to help, such as donating to local organizations feeding people or running food drives, Mjartan said.
She encouraged everyone to do whatever they could, whether donating to the statewide relief fund or giving a neighbor something to eat. Restaurants across the state also helped out by offering free meals.
“The fact that that particular fund didn’t fill up with contributions of $5 million, $6 million like we hoped does not mean millions of dollars did not go to organizations doing that on-the-ground food work,” Mjartan said.
Although the emergency feeding fund will wrap up in the coming days, the general One SC Fund remains open year-round, Mjartan said. Any money donated to the general fund and not a specific cause goes toward helping when an emergency happens, so the fund can get money to people as quickly as possible, she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0382-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

Al Gentry, D-Louisville. (LRC Public Information)Louisville Democratic Rep. Al Gentry is stepping down as chair of the Kentucky House minority caucus.
The Democratic Caucus elected Lexington Democratic Rep. Lindsey Burke as the new chair. She was previously the House Democratic whip, according to a press release. Her successor will be selected Friday. 
Gentry, who represents the 46th House District in Jefferson County, was selected as the caucus chair in late 2024. He has served in the House since 2017. 
Gentry said he plans to seek reelection and continue serving his current term in office. 
Gentry is leaving leadership to work on a new adaptive golf initiative, according to the news release. The sport allows people with disabilities to play golf through modified rules or equipment. In 1993, Gentry lost his dominant right arm in a workplace drilling accident while working as a hydrogeologist. 
Gentry, who is on the board of directors for the United States Adaptive Golf Alliance, helped establish the alliance and later co-authored competitive standards and a ranking system for adaptive golf in the U.S. 
Stepping down from leadership will give “him time to provide leadership as a senior advisor to a national leadership team preparing for a major new initiative in Adaptive Golf,” says the press release. 
“I’m not at liberty to share specifics of this initiative, for proprietary reasons, but I can say that if launched successfully it will be the first of its kind,” Gentry said. “It will tremendously improve access and affordability for golfers with disabilities to participate in competitive adaptive golf events across the nation.”
He added: “This new opportunity is a short-term, part-time position that will not affect my continued work in the Kentucky General Assembly, which I’m honored and proud to continue. It will, however, impact my time set aside for duties as caucus chairman. For that reason, out of respect for my colleagues and party, I felt it was necessary to step aside at year’s end to allow my successor plenty of time to transition properly.  Since I will continue serving as a state representative, I will be accessible to my successor as caucus chair for any necessary input that may be warranted.”

(Getty Images)Indiana officials on Thursday named nine finalists for three open seats on the powerful Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, which oversees electric, gas, water and telecommunications rates across the state.
The finalists were announced publicly in Indianapolis and are Nathan Cazee, Christopher Lewis, Anthony Swinger, Joshua Bain, Sen. Andy Zay, Alfonso Vidal, Bob Deig, Carolene Mays and Elizabeth Walker. They were selected from a pool of 47 applicants by the state’s Utility Regulatory Nominating Committee, which interviewed 22 candidates over the last month.
The commission’s makeup has to include members of both political parties, so the first six recommendations are for two Republican seats and the final three are for a Democratic appointment.
“We had an extremely difficult time,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s secretary of Energy and Natural Resources and chair of the nominating committee, citing the strong field of candidates. She said there is no statutory timeline for when Gov. Mike Braun will make his selections.
The IURC plays a critical role in setting the rates and service standards for Indiana’s regulated utilities. Commissioners are appointed by the governor. The new members will help guide state energy policy at a time of mounting public concern over rising electricity and natural gas bills.
Cazee works for the air-quality company Daikin Applied in southern Indiana, while Lewis currently serves as a technical advisor for the IURC. Swinger has spent more than 25 years with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents ratepayers in commission cases. Bain is a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council, and Zay has represented portions of northeast Indiana in the state Senate since 2016.
The other finalists include Vidal, a southern Indiana businessman; Deig, a former state senator and Posey County official; Mays, a former state representative and small-business owner who previously served on the IURC; and Walker, an attorney for the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency.
The nominating committee’s recommendations now go to Braun, who will decide which candidates to appoint. Although the committee operates under a defined application and interview schedule, the governor faces no deadline to make his choices.
In announcing the search earlier this fall, the administration pointed to widespread frustration among Hoosiers over rising utility costs. The IURC, by law, is intended to serve as an impartial arbiter — “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities” — but its decisions often draw scrutiny from consumer advocates and lawmakers alike.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service directed the Iowa HHS to issue full SNAP benefits for the month of November, according to an Iowa HHS spokesperson. Previously, Iowa HHS had issued guidance that partial SNAP benefits would be provided for the month as the federal shutdown was still ongoing, as instructed by the Trump administration, though the state department did not provide timing on when the benefits would be released.

The shutdown ended Wednesday night, when President Donald Trump signed a federal funding package reopening the government through January. With the federal government reopening, a USDA spokesperson told States Newsroom SNAP benefits for most participants will be available “within 24 hours for most States.”
Though delayed, full food assistance benefits are being provided for November in Iowa beginning Thursday, Iowa HHS stated, with benefits “being loaded onto cards now and could be available later today.” Full benefits are anticipated to be available to all SNAP recipients Friday, according to the department.
There are roughly 42 million people nationwide who use SNAP benefits to access food. In Iowa, there are roughly 270,000 individuals enrolled in the program, and the state receives around $45 million each month in benefits.
The department recommended SNAP recipients check their Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card balances before making any purchases. Balances can be checked by calling the number on the back of their EBT card, 800-359-5802, or by logging into their ConnectEBT account by browser or through the mobile app.
Earlier in November, Gov. Kim Reynolds had announced the state would match up to $1 million in donations made to Iowa food banks in order to address increased need in Iowa communities caused by the lapse in SNAP benefits, as well as plans to deploy Iowa National Guard troops to assist with food distribution across the state. Other entities throughout the state, including Polk County, also pledged money to assist local food banks — as did businesses like Hy-Vee and Fareway, as well as the three state Medicaid managed care organizations, Iowa Total Care, Molina Healthcare of Iowa, and Wellpoint Iowa.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After much uncertainty in the midst of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, all Utah Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program customers are expected to receive full November benefits by Saturday. 
The Utah Department of Workforce Services, which administers the benefit, said on Thursday that the benefit, widely known as SNAP, will be issued within 24 hours. The announcement came hours after federal elected officials signed a spending package, funding most government operations through January.
SNAP users in Utah typically receive payments every month’s 5th, 11th or 15th, depending on their last name, Becky Wickstrom, public information officer at the Department of Workforce Services, said.

“No benefits have gone out yet, but those who would have received them on the 5th and 11th will start seeing those tomorrow,” Wickstrom said. “And then, if customers would normally receive them on the 15th, then they will come as scheduled.”
As Utah faces partial SNAP payments, GOP leaders deny Dems’ request to fill the void

October payments were already allocated during the government shutdown, but chaos emerged in November, with contradicting instructions from different courts and federal agencies. 
Some states had issued court-ordered full payments, but Utah didn’t release any SNAP funds during November. The latest action in the turmoil was an instruction from President Donald Trump to reverse a portion of the payments after an emergency Supreme Court ruling allowing the administration to make partial SNAP payments. 
The Department of Workforce Services had been following federal guidance throughout the process, Wickstrom said. 
“Our latest guidance before the government reopened, was that emergency federal funding would be used to issue a 65% amount of everyone’s SNAP benefits. And so we were in the process of making that happen, that requires us to shift things around in our system,” she said. “We were on track to have that also in place by the 15th but with the government reopened, we’re really happy to announce that we can issue that full benefit as normal.”



Let us know what you think...


 


About 87,000 Utah families rely on the benefit, which is completely funded by the federal government. State leaders remained firm in their decision not to step in and cover the payments during the shutdown, but committing up to $4 million to help support the Utah Food Bank.
Utah Senate Democrats pleaded to convene in a special session to use rainy day funds to fund SNAP, with Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, saying that “Utah has the means to step in and ensure no one goes hungry while we wait for federal action.”
But, Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders maintained their stance, arguing that “using state funds to compensate for federal inaction would rapidly drain reserves and undermine Utah’s long-term fiscal stability.”
A warning on scams
With all benefits dropping into people’s accounts again, Wickstrom also warned Utah customers about recent benefits thefts involving SNAP’s Electronic Benefit Transfer cards.
“It seems like thieves are getting more sophisticated and advanced in the way that they can steal EBT card information,” Wickstrom said. “Unfortunately, when they get the card number and they’re able to get into someone’s account, once that money is spent, it is gone.”
The Department of Workforce Services advises users to lock their EBT cards through the ConnectEBT app when they aren’t in use.
“We want customers to get the ConnectEBT mobile app, then lock their card whenever they’re not making a purchase,” Wickstrom said. “They can even do this in real time. So, in line at the grocery store, unlock your card, make a purchase, lock it again, and hopefully that helps them keep track of their benefits and keep the money that they need to feed their families.”

NEW CASTLE, Del. (Nov. 13, 2025) — More than 20 dementia caregivers spent Thursday morning learning strategies, sharing personal stories, and connecting with experts during a Family Caregivers Month workshop hosted by the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter at Canaan Baptist Church.
The half-day program, held from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., brought together local clinicians, advocates, and caregivers for conversations about burnout, family dynamics, memory-care planning, and the growing network of support services across Delaware.
“Caring for someone living with dementia brings a unique set of challenges and rewards,” said Erica Holmes, programs manager for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter
“Caring for someone living with dementia brings a unique set of challenges and rewards,” said Erica Holmes, programs manager for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter. “No one should face dementia alone. Caregivers must have access to tools and best practices that can guide them on their journey.”
A caregiver’s story sets the tone
The workshop opened with a deeply personal reflection from Sonja Brown, a longtime caregiver who now mentors others navigating the emotional and practical demands of dementia.
“My husband was diagnosed three years ago and I’m still learning every day,” Brown told attendees. “Who would have thought that my husband — a veteran, a deacon at our church, and a community leader — would struggle with Alzheimer’s? He was the strongest man I know.”
Brown and her husband recently celebrated their 54th wedding anniversary. She said caregiving has become an act of partnership and perseverance.
“I just want to help others find their way as caregivers,” she said. “If we can understand dementia in a way that helps our families, we can face this together.”
Experts highlight respite care, dementia education, and support programs
Dr. Damali Thomas, who moderated a panel discussion, led a conversation about real-life caregiving challenges, communication struggles, and the emotional impact of the journey.
The workshop continued with presentations from medical professionals and community organizations:


Jonathan Swartz of Easterseals offered guidance on respite care and accessibility programs that give caregivers short-term relief.


Dr. Damali Thomas, who moderated a panel discussion, led a conversation about real-life caregiving challenges, communication struggles, and the emotional impact of the journey.


Adrienne Halloway, Ph.D., of the ChristianaCare Swank Center for Memory Care presented information about the ChristianaCare GUIDE Program, which delivers coordinated dementia care — including caregiver training, respite services, personalized care plans, and 24/7 support — at no additional cost to Medicare patients.


The GUIDE model, she said, is designed “to improve quality of life for families and help loved ones stay safely at home for as long as possible.”
Building community during Family Caregivers Month
Thursday’s program was one of several Delaware events held to recognize November as National Family Caregivers Month, an annual observance honoring the unpaid caregivers who support millions of Americans living with chronic or cognitive conditions.
Attendees spent the morning comparing experiences, asking questions of experts, and gathering printed materials from resource tables. Organizers said the goal was simple: ensure caregivers feel seen, supported, and connected.
“Caregiving is a journey,” Holmes said. “This workshop is about making sure nobody walks it alone.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/13/ct-senate-federal-cuts-snap-vote/,The CT Senate voted 27-8 to designate $500 million to potentially backfill federal cuts to nutrition and other human service programs.,"The state Senate gave final approval in special session Thursday afternoon to bills to safeguard human services from federal cuts and was expected to adopt a bill to enable UConn Health to purchase financially imperiled Waterbury Hospital.
The Democratic-controlled Senate voted 27-8, largely along party lines, to designate $500 million from state reserves to potentially backfill federal cuts to nutrition, health care, heating assistance and other human service programs for the remainder of this fiscal year, which wraps June 30.
The measure, which the House of Representatives approved on Wednesday, now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont, who is expected to sign it.
“The things that matter most to me are feeding people and making sure they’re warm,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said of the response fund, which would be created using one-fifth of last fiscal year’s  $2.5 billion state budget surplus.
Connecticut has used more than $10 billion in surplus to whittle down its considerable pension debt since 2020, on top of the more than $3 billion in required pension contributions it makes annually through the budget. Analysts project the state will continue to make billions in surplus contributions over the rest of the decade.
“This bill builds on that momentum” while ensuring vulnerable residents aren’t left hungry or cold in the coming months, Osten said. “It’s about discipline and compassion.”
According to the bill, Lamont has sole authority to propose expenditures from that $500 million pool. But a 6-member panel of state legislative leaders — which includes the House and Senate majority and minority leaders along with the House speaker and Senate president pro tem — could block any spending with a simple majority vote.
Any dollars not spent by June 30 would be used to pay down state pension debt.
That plan appealed to Republicans and Democrats alike in the House, where majorities from both parties overwhelmingly approved the fund Wednesday.
But eight of 11 Senate Republicans opposed the response fund as unnecessary and a tool to finance Democrats’ pet projects.
“I do believe this is a slush fund,” state Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said during a press conference just prior to Thursday’s session. “The language that’s written is so ambiguous I don’t know what they’re going to spend this money on.”
The federal government shutdown, which began Oct. 1, stalled federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, starting Nov. 1. Gov. Ned Lamont ordered November SNAP benefits paid out beginning Nov. 8, even if the state had to bear the roughly $72 million monthly bill.
“We do not want to see interruptions to basic programs like food stamps or WIC [Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance for Women, Infants and Children] for those who are most in need,” said Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich. “That premise, I think, has gone by the wayside.”
Fazio was referencing a decision by the U.S. House of Representatives last Monday to give final approval to the temporary funding measure needed to end the shutdown.
But Connecticut Democrats have been talking since President Donald Trump took office in January, long before the shutdown began Oct. 1, about using the state’s huge resources to backfill impending federal cuts in human service programs.
The Trump administration since last spring has used a host of legal maneuvers to block health care, education, nutrition and other federal aid to Connecticut.
And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump and the GOP-led Congress adopted in July ordered more than $1 trillion in cuts to health care and social services over the next decade to help finance roughly $4.5 trillion in tax relief — breaks aimed chiefly at high-earning households.
“We have what we’re seeing, and we have seen, since Jan. 20, is just chaos and confusion and cruelty to the American people and also to the people of the state of Connecticut,” Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said during a press conference prior to Thursday’s debate.
“I’m baffled about the secret mission some people think we have here,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, who recalled lines of desperate residents seeking help at emptied food pantries once SNAP benefits stopped on Nov. 1. “I’ve heard the conversation, both in this chamber and the other chamber: ‘What is it you’re trying to do?’
“Health care? Yes. Food? Yes. Heat? Yes. That’s the ‘secret mission’.”
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chairman of the Human Services Committee, said the state response fund is badly needed because the bill Trump signed in July will cause immediate pain for significant numbers of Connecticut residents.
The measure could remove about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness from SNAP eligibility in Connecticut between Dec. 1 and March 31.
Starting Jan. 1, Washington will cancel subsidies that help people afford health coverage through through state-based insurance exchanges like Access Health CT. The cost to consumers here is projected at almost $300 million per year.
“To me that seems like an emergency because there is no federal action to reverse that decision,” Lesser said.
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, countered that if Connecticut residents need help, the General Assembly should return those dollars to households as a credit against state income taxes rather than creating a $500 million fund to bolster certain programs.
“These are excess dollars that belong to the people of Connecticut, that we have taxed as a state,” he said, offering an amendment to order the relief and estimating it would save households $300 to $400.
The Senate voted to reject the amendment 24-11 along party lines.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9056-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

About 3,200 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted to approve Boeing’s latest offer by a 68% margin, after rejecting the company’s previous four offers.
Boeing leaders said they “look forward to having the full team back at work” beginning on Sunday.
The approved offer includes a $6,000 signing bonus, instead of the original $5,000 offered in August. However, Boeing extended the contract’s term from four to five years, with a 24% general wage increase – 8% in the first year and 4% in each of the following years. 
What didn’t make it into the contract for union workers was their demanded $10,000 ratification bonus, 401-K benefit match and a higher wage increase for longtime employees.
“IAM District 837 members stood strong and united for over three months,” according to a union statement after the vote. “We thank our bargaining committee for their tireless efforts, and we appreciate the unwavering support of our members, their families, the St. Louis community, our labor allies, and elected officials throughout this fight.” 
Steve Parker, executive vice president of The Boeing Company and president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, wrote a letter to employees earlier this week saying the strike “has been stressful for everyone.”
“With the holidays approaching,” he wrote, “we want to get everyone back to work and provide stability for you and your families with higher wages, health care and guaranteed holiday pay.”
The company heard from many employees that they’d like more cash up front, Parker said, rather than Boeing stock. 
“We’ve taken all of that to heart with a revised offer that incorporates your feedback while continuing to stay within the economic value of our prior offers,” he said.
Parker said the company has already hired permanent replacement workers “as we moved into the next phase of our contingency plan.”
“Despite that, we will guarantee that all IAM 837 members will be returned to work if this offer is ratified,” he said. “No one would be displaced. This is not something we will be able to guarantee moving forward.” 
Boeing’s decision to use replacement workers to complete fighter jet projects in St. Louis put the company at odds with members of the U.S. Senate. 
Earlier this month, five Democratic senators pilloried the plan for replacement workers as potentially putting the nation’s military at risk. 
“For existing projects, such as the F-15 Eagle and the F/A-18 Hornet, you are also unnecessarily endangering our warfighters by insisting on proceeding with an untrained and hastily recruited workforce,”  said the letter the senators sent Tuesday to Boeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg.
Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri sent his own letter to Ortberg demanding the company negotiate in good faith with striking workers. 
“These workers help produce our nation’s most crucial, most advanced, and most expensive defense tools,” Hawley wrote. “And since your company receives billions in government contracts, it is incumbent upon you to do the right thing.”
Parker, in his letter, boasted that the offer includes wage growth for longtime employees and more vacation and sick leave for all employees. The average base pay will go from $75,000 to $109,000 a year. And, there’s “potential for even more value with overtime,” he wrote.
The union vowed to continue to fight for “fairness and respect for the world’s best defense workers” in future negotiations.
“We’re proud of what our members have fought for together,” according to the union’s Thursday statement, “and are ready to get back to building the world’s most advanced military aircraft.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boeing-strike-IAM-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-13 21:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT could still see some fallout from government shutdown,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/13/ct-federal-government-shutdown-fallout/,"Federal workers are awaiting missed paychecks, and programs that rely on federal grants have stalled, though they could resume soon.","The fallout of the 43-day-long government shutdown will linger for some time in Connecticut, even after all federal workers returned to work on Thursday.
Federal workers are awaiting missed paychecks, and programs and services that rely on federal grants have stalled, though both are expected to resume soon. And local food pantries hope to bounce back amid the funding lapse of federal nutrition assistance that led to a confusing back-and-forth over whether recipients would get their November benefits.
Connecticut’s entire congressional of five representatives and two senators opposed the deal brokered by some in the Democratic Party Wednesday night to end the shutdown because it didn’t meet their health care demands and guarantee the extension of expiring enhanced premium subsidies.
Pressure had been building to end the stalemate. As the shutdown dragged on, people in Connecticut and across the country started seeing disruptions to services, multiple missed paychecks for federal workers and travel delays and flight cuts that are expected to continue.
Connecticut didn’t feel the full brunt of the shutdown because the state filled in some of the gaps where federal dollars had temporarily dried up. Still, some lingering effects of the shutdown won’t immediately go away.
“There’s absolutely going to be a ripple effect. It’s not like you hit a switch and everything goes back to normal. But this wasn’t just about one thing,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said.
All federal workers will get back pay
Federal employees didn’t receive paychecks during the shutdown even if they were required to work, with the exception this time around for members of the military, who got paid twice.
President Donald Trump had suggested at times that furloughed workers might not get back pay, even though it is a requirement of a law that was passed during his first administration.
That 2019 law states federal workers must receive back pay “at the earliest date possible” once the government reopens.
To quash any doubt about those payments, the Senate deal to reopen the government included a guarantee of back pay for those on furlough. It also reverses layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, which were already paused by federal judges.The timing of payments will vary by agency. But the Trump administration said it plans to start processing payments on Saturday and wrapping up the process by Wednesday, according to a published report.
SNAP is back but food demand is still high
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will once again be funded.
Disruptions to this nutrition assistance were unprecedented. SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, had never seen cuts before in the program’s history — and what resulted was whiplash over whether recipients would receive their November benefits.
Funding for SNAP came to a halt on Nov. 1 as the shutdown stretched into another month. What resulted was chaos and confusion: November’s monthly benefits weren’t loaded onto Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT cards, federal judges then ruled that the Trump administration must fund SNAP, and after mixed messaging, Connecticut decided to restore benefits last weekend.
Gov. Ned Lamont had been reluctant to spend state funds on the federal program but pledged to keep it running for the rest of the month even if funding from the feds stalled again. But with the shutdown over, SNAP benefits will come back everywhere.
The whiplash over the state of SNAP benefits put increased demand on local food banks and pantries across Connecticut.
“The emergency food system has definitely sustained some structural damage because of the length of the federal shutdown. It’s going to take a little while for us all to crawl out of this,” Connecticut Foodshare President and CEO Jason Jakubowski said. “Things aren’t going to go back to perfect the minute that the president signs the bill.”
Connecticut Foodshare works with more than 600 food pantries across the state as well as 110 mobile sites. The organization hired temporary workers and drivers to help meet the demand caused by the shutdown, which Jakubowski said has yet to subside.
“We also haven’t seen the lines at our pantries and our mobile trucks go back down to pre-shutdown levels yet either,” Jakubowski said. “Things were not perfect on Sept. 30 before the shutdown started. It has been a very, very difficult year for us in food banking, particularly 2025 as a whole.”
Food aid has already taken a hit this year because of federal cutbacks. Connecticut was hit by cuts earlier this year to The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP. And food banks also lost the federal dollars that allowed them to buy in bulk from local farmers and created more access to fresh produce.
Plus, food pantries are preparing for demand of Thanksgiving and the December holidays.
“My message to my staff today was ‘yes, the shutdown is over, but we’re still in a semi-emergency mode at least though end of the calendar year,'” Jakubowski said.
Because of the strain, Jakubowski said, he hopes it’ll encourage stakeholders to have more proactive conversations about addressing hunger, and not just “when there’s a crisis.” 
Head Start weathered funding lapses 
Most Head Start centers in Connecticut went unscathed, but two local centers faced funding lapses in federal dollars earlier this month. Both continued operating without it after Connecticut’s Office of Early Childhood stepped in with temporary funding for one month.
Head Start centers — early childhood services that serve low-income children from birth to age 5 — start their federal grant cycles on different timelines. Only half a dozen were operating without federal funding in October. But that number ballooned, with an additional 134 programs that were supposed to start on Nov. 1.
That included two in Connecticut: EdAdvance, a Regional Educational Service Center serving western Connecticut, and Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County in Stamford. Between the two, they have a combined 395 slots serving children in Head Start and Early Head Start programs.
“We just happen to be in the cohort that’s supposed to start funding in the middle of a shutdown,” EdAdvance executive director Jonathan Costa said. “The timing and the impact of it is greater than I would have ever imagined.”
EdAdvance was supposed to get its five-year federal grant starting on Nov. 1. To help, Costa said, the state fronted his organization half of its total allocation to stay open in November. He said none of the staff missed a paycheck during the shutdown.
Costa said the agreement with the state is paying the money back once the federal government “makes us whole for November.”
“I’m not expecting any prolonged delay once the government is back online to us receiving our funding,” Costa said. “It’ll only be a problem if it takes them into December to do it.”
During the shutdown, Monica Maccera Filppu, the CEO of Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County, had sent a message to families that they would stay open and didn’t anticipate “any immediate changes to our services.”
The National Head Start Association said it could take up to two weeks for some centers to be able to start drawing down funds and resources.
Connecticut ultimately didn’t have any disruptions to services or closures of centers. But during the shutdown, 20 programs closed across 17 states and Puerto Rico. That affected more than 9,000 seats in Head Start programs across the country.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274456520062-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Photo via Google Earth)For the third time in five years, a Sioux City hospital’s status as a Level III Trauma Center has been placed on probation by state regulators due to an ongoing series of regulatory violations.
Last month, UnityPoint Health’s St. Luke’s Hospital in Sioux City entered into a consent agreement with the Iowa Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Bureau, placing the hospital’s trauma center certification on probation for one year.
The hospital currently is certified as a Level III Trauma Center, which means it can stabilize and care for trauma patients and also has access to general surgery and orthopedic surgery.

A downgrade to Level IV status would mean the hospital could provide basic life support and stabilization for trauma patients but would focus on transferring patients to higher-level trauma centers as soon as possible.
A spokesperson for UnityPoint said Thursday the corporation has no comment on the new consent agreement.
State records show the Sioux City hospital’s trauma center certification has been an issue since October 2018, when it was issued a citation and warning by the bureau for failure to comply with all of the criteria for Level III status. In March 2020, it was issued a second citation and warning due to failure to comply with Level III criteria.
In May 2021, the bureau determined the hospital had again failed to comply with all Level III criteria as evidenced by 47 deficiencies, including five serious “Type I” deficiencies. The Iowa Department of Public Health, now known as the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, then placed the hospital’s Level III status on probation for one year and required UnityPoint to submit a plan of correction and to participate in a “focused” inspection intended to assess the hospital’s adherence to that plan of correction.
In April 2022, the focused inspection was conducted and the department determined that 44 of the 47 cited deficiencies had been successfully resolved — with three areas of continued noncompliance. As a result, the department placed the hospital’s Level III status on “extended probation” for one year through July 2023.
In April 2023, the hospital was deemed in compliance, and a new certificate for Level III status was issued. In July 2024, after another inspection, the department concluded the hospital had again failed to comply with all criteria for Level III status, citing 26 deficiencies — including 15 that were repeat offenses due to their being cited in the May 2021 inspection.
In October 2024, the hospital was issued another citation and warning for failure to comply with all of the criteria for Level III status. After a July 2025 focused inspection, the department concluded the hospital had successfully resolved 23 of the 26 violations. But in addition to the three unresolved deficiencies, a new deficiency was cited, raising the total number of unresolved issues to four.
Last month, pursuant to a consent agreement with the hospital, the department again placed the Sioux City hospital’s Level III status on probation for one year through October 2026.
The agreement requires the hospital to submit a new corrective action plan, along with “letters of commitment from all medical staff active in trauma resuscitation.”
In addition, the hospital must now submit quarterly reports, to be approved by UnityPoint’s corporate office for accuracy, that will detail efforts to address systemic problems and care-provider issues, as well as proposed improvements to the care of injured patients.
Among the specific issues the hospital now has to address:
— Patient care issues reviewed: The bureau alleges the hospital has not staged well-attended multidisciplinary trauma peer review committee meetings, preventing the review of issues and problems related to patient care. Going forward, the committee must meet regularly, with the trauma resuscitation medical staff in attendance, to review potential problems and any proposed improvements to the care of the injured. In addition, each member of the hospital’s group of general surgeons must attend at least half of the committee meetings.
— Timely case evaluations: The hospital failed to adhere to standards that call for “concurrent trauma registries” — a process of case review that’s intended to ensure at least 80% of patient records are completed within 60 days of a patient’s discharge. Compliance with this standard is considered crucial to patient safety because it allows for the timely identification and correction of any problems that occur during active treatment. While the standard is for 80% of all cases to be completed, the Sioux City hospital’s concurrency rate was only 29% from July 2024 to June 2025, the bureau alleges.
The consent agreement between the hospital and the bureau states that if the hospital does not have the ability to fully resolve its deficiencies, it can apply for a downgraded Level IV status. If that happens, the hospital must notify ambulance services and the trauma coordinators at other hospitals so patients can be directed elsewhere if need be.
The agreement also stipulates that the department can revoke probation and require the hospital to seek Level IV certification at any time during the 2025-26 probation period.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican state Sen. Eric Bassler announced Thursday that he is opposed to redrawing Indiana’s congressional districts.
Bassler, R-Washington, is the seventh Senate Republican to publicly come out against the push initiated by President Donald Trump for redistricting in Indiana and other GOP-led states.
Thirteen Republican senators have come out in support, but half of the 40-member caucus haven’t made their stances known publicly.


The following GOP senators have come out in opposition to redistricting:
Sen. Eric Bassler
Sen. Vaneta Becker
Sen. Spencer Deery
Sen. Sue Glick
Sen. Jean Leising
Sen. Jim Tomes
Sen. Greg Walker


“I cannot support any mid-census redistricting plan,” Bassler said in an emailed statement. “Four years ago, my Republican colleagues and I voted for our current state and federal legislative maps. I stand by that vote and I will not support legislation to change our congressional maps.”
Bassler announced in July that he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2026 and leave the Legislature after 12 years from his rural southwestern Indiana district.
Indiana lawmakers are scheduled to meet starting Dec. 1 to consider drawing more Republican-leaning U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by Trump’s administration and his supporters.
Senate Republican leadership has said they do not yet have enough votes to pass a redistricting bill. Any new maps would need a majority of 26 senators or 25 with Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith breaking a tie in support.
Enough House Republicans are believed to be supportive of a redistricting effort for it to win passage in that chamber.
Democratic legislators — who are too few in number to even delay a redistricting bill — have been unanimous in opposition.
Redistricting supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine Indiana congressional districts favoring Republicans based on 2020 census data. The current split is 7-2 in favor of the GOP.
Undecided senators have become the target of advertising campaigns, including digital, cellphone, television and mail ads from pro-redistricting groups.

Vice Chief Justice Dana Kuehn, writing for the court’s 7-2 majority, found that serving as an agency head and as a gubernatorial Cabinet secretary does not violate a state law that bars dual office holding.
The ruling nullifies a 2024 opinion issued by Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who had contended.
that Cabinet secretaries are not exempt from the state’s prohibition against dual office holding. The opinion had the force of law until a court determined otherwise.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and three of his Cabinet officials sued, arguing that Drummond had misinterpreted the law. They filed suit in district court and lost. They appealed it to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Drummond’s opinion caused Transportation Secretary Tim Gatz to resign as Cabinet secretary. He also vacated his post as head of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, but remained as head of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation after being reappointed.

Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell resigned as Stitt’s secretary of workforce development.
After the opinion, Stitt renamed his cabinet secretaries advisors.
Stitt praised the high court’s decision.
“For four decades, Oklahoma governors have been able to pick their Cabinet members, plain and simple,” Stitt said in a press release. “I set out to make government more efficient, and two people doing one job makes no sense.”
He said Drummond wasted taxpayer dollars to pursue a politically motivated vendetta and grab campaign headlines.
Drummond, who is running for governor, routinely spars with Stitt on policy and legal issues.
“We appreciate the Oklahoma Supreme Court providing clarity to this issue,” said Leslie Berger, a Drummond spokesperson. “With such ambiguity resolved, cabinet secretaries no longer need to fear that their service could be challenged as violating the dual office-holding provision.”

Sterling College, an experiential college in the Orleans County town of Craftsbury, announced on Thursday it would be ending its academic programs after the upcoming spring semester, becoming the latest in a string of transitions and closures at small colleges.
The college’s decision to end programming was made “in the face of persistent financial and enrollment challenges,” according to a statement posted to the college’s website. The school’s final commencement ceremony will be held in May 2026.
The tiny college in the Northeast Kingdom has provided environmentally focused education for more than 65 years, focusing its courses on advancing ecological stewardship. The school’s enrollment was capped at 125 students, but for several years fewer than 100 students enrolled at the school.
“We understand that this news is difficult and deeply personal for every member of our community,” the college’s statement reads. “Sterling College has always been more than a place of learning; it has been a home where curiosity, creativity, and compassion thrived.”
The college said it will ensure students enrolled at the college will have a path to completing their degree or to transfer to another college or university, according to their press release. 
“Right now, we’re totally focused on seeing students through the spring and getting as many finished as we can by mid summer, maybe August,” Scott Thomas, the college’s president, said in an interview. “That’s our singular focus.”
The school in its statement said that partner institutions including Champlain College and Community College of Vermont have agreed to accept transfer credits and financial aid packages “without requiring the regular application process,” pending approval of the New England Commission of Higher Education.
While the college is ending its degree programs in the spring, Hannah Rushing, the school’s director of advancement, said the school will remain fully accredited through the summer in order to run summer internships.
What that future looks like is unclear. 
Allison Hooper, the chair of the college’s board of trustees and co-founder of Vermont Creamery, said in a press release that ending degree programs “provides the most responsible way to honor Sterling’s commitments to its students, faculty, and staff while preserving its values and legacy.”
 Thomas, the president, said the college’s board of trustees will determine how to steward the college’s remaining resources. 
“How that manifests itself? I don’t think now is the time to say,” Thomas said, “but let’s just say we’ve been a plucky little institution for more than 65 years.” 
“I don’t know what’s next, but there will be resources remaining,” he went on. “We do have a very clear mission, and we do have a fantastic board, so we’ll see what happens at that point.”
He added that “the community is going to figure prominently in whatever evolves here.”
Sterling College’s announcement comes as similar challenges have weighed on Vermont’s higher education institutions. A number of schools that have closed in recent years faced similar declines in enrollment, including Green Mountain College in Poultney, the College of St. Joseph in Rutland and Goddard College in Plainfield. The Vermont College of Fine Arts in Montpelier did not close but ended all its on-campus programming. 
Broader demographic challenges are playing a role in that, Thomas said. Small schools like Sterling College have meanwhile faced competition from larger public institutions, and from institutions with large online course offerings.
“The reality is that mission-driven education like Sterling and financial sustainability are often at odds,” he said. “I see that at Sterling, and we’ve seen that across the other small colleges that have closed across the state.”
Sterling College, in its statement, said its “spirit and legacy” would live on through “the hundreds of alumni, faculty, staff, and partners who carry forward its mission and values in their work and communities.”
“The legacy of Sterling’s commitment to sustainability, community, and hands-on learning will continue to inspire generations to come,” the statement reads.

(Photo by Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Tim Moore of North Carolina said Thursday he was in support of U.S. Border Patrol reportedly planning operations in Charlotte, drawing a stark contrast to local elected officials who have pointed to “fear and uncertainty” among immigrants.
Moore, a Republican who represents parts of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, said his office had reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for further information on the reported operation.
“I’m glad that they’re looking at doing that, and I’m glad at the way they’re approaching it,” Moore told reporters in Raleigh.
If the agency does deploy in the city, Moore predicted they would likely stay “for a while” and focus on organized crime and high-profile targets. That would largely be a departure from Border Patrol’s month-long Chicago campaign, which has involved street sweeps and resulted in mass arrests, including of hundreds who a judge says were wrongfully detained. The operation has prompted widespread protests and multiple court interventions.
Moore said he didn’t expect operations in Charlotte, if they do take place, to encounter such resistance.
“You may have some of that, but Charlotte is not Chicago,” Moore said. “I don’t think there will be an appetite for that. I don’t think there will be patience for folks who get out there and violate the law themselves, interfering with a valid law enforcement activity.”
CBS first reported this week that the agency is planning to move agents into Charlotte and New Orleans. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed Thursday afternoon that agents would start as soon as this weekend.
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has said it doesn’t comment on future plans or operations. Mayor Vi Lyles said Wednesday she was aware of the reports and that Charlotte was “committed to following the law and to protecting the rights of all people who call our city home.”
The office of U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat who represents much of Charlotte, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. The congresswoman’s public social media accounts have not posted about the reported operations as of Thursday afternoon.
And state Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), in a brief interview with NC Newsline, said the report of the CBP operations “hasn’t been verified.” McFadden issued his statement confirming the agency’s plan later Thursday.
“I’m going to be keeping my eyes on my own safety for right now,” Cunningham said, when asked for her reaction to the reported plans.
Cunningham has said she received threats after breaking with her Democratic colleagues to support state efforts to crack down on immigration enforcement. During a July vote to require local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE, she said in a floor speech that immigrants “must assimilate” and “adapt to the culture they wish to live in.”

Other leaders in Charlotte see that issue differently.
In a joint statement released Tuesday, a group of Charlotte-area officials said that local and state law enforcement do not control, direct or participate in federal operations. And the group, including council members, Democratic state lawmakers and a school board member, pledged to support the city’s immigrant communities.
“We still stand together, look out for one another, and ensure that fear never divides the city we all call home,” the group said.
McFadden, the county sheriff, has previously had public disagreements with federal immigration officials about their operations in the region. In his Thursday statement, he said he had been contacted by federal agents Wednesday afternoon and his office was not asked to assist with or participate in enforcement.
Stein told reporters Wednesday that if he had “absolute confidence” in immigration officials’ plan to “go and find violent dangerous drug traffickers and criminals,” then the city would “welcome them with open arms,” the Charlotte Observer reported. But the governor emphasized that “we don’t know what their plans are.”
“If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them,” Stein said. “If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned.”
Stein’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Charlotte, Mecklenburg County have been flashpoint for political disagreements on law enforcement
Even prior to reported federal immigration operations, Charlotte has emerged as the epicenter of already intense debates on how North Carolina should address both illegal immigration and violent crime.
The killing of Ukrainian immigrant Iryna Zarutska on the city’s light rail system sparked fury and frustration from state lawmakers, who convened to pass a new law changing criminal justice procedures.  The state House Speaker has said he’s closely tracking violent crime in Charlotte. And a trio of Republican congressmen — U.S. Reps. Mark Harris, Pat Harrigan and Chuck Edwards — urged Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard in the city.
Moore said Thursday he had been approached by U.S. Rep. Mark Harris to sign that letter, but had declined.
The scrutiny on violent crime, Moore said, should be focused primarily on magistrate judges rather than local law enforcement. And he praised the district attorney, Democrat Spencer Merriweather, calling him a “good prosecutor.”

“There’s not a shortage of law enforcement, nor is there a situation where law enforcement is … turning a blind eye, and not trying to deal with criminals,” Moore said.
The city and its surrounding county have also faced criticism from Republicans aiming to clamp down on immigration enforcement. A law passed earlier this year sought to close “loopholes” in ICE detainer cases that GOP lawmakers accused several sheriffs, including in Mecklenburg County, of utilizing.
Moore, who led the House as Speaker when an earlier law dealing with detainer cases was passed, acknowledged that there was “some frustration” with the sheriff’s department on immigration enforcement.
“He’s told me what his position is, and we just have a disagreement of opinion on it,” Moore said. “Hopefully he will see the error of that as more and more crimes, more and more things are being brought to the surface about what’s happening.”

Byrd U.S. Courthouse in Charleston, West Virginia, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey presented at an energy summit in downtown Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday, where he praised numerous power-related projects that are either underway or soon to be coming in the Mountain State.
The announcements included the construction of a new natural gas power plant in Harrison County, the expansion of an existing power company in Hancock County and the creation of new gas compression-related manufacturing jobs in Weirton.
Morrisey said the investments for these projects total more than $4 billion from private companies. He called the projects — several of which had already been previously announced — crucial for West Virginia to ensure that energy remains a dominant but diverse market.
He also said that residents should expect to hear more updates on different, soon-to-come projects and developments “over the next 30 to 60 days.”
“We’ve been a little busy, but there’s going to be more,” Morrisey said. “We had a number of projects we were working to get announced by today but, you know, you can’t control the timing of really big announcements coming.”
While he celebrated the potential for increased energy production and jobs, Morrisey did not give much mention to environmental risks or concerns about such developments. More in-depth details for several of the projects were not shared on Thursday.
Morrisey said, under his leadership, residents should trust him when he says something is going to be built and that such announcements are not just “hot air.”
“I don’t announce things unless they’re going to happen. I want you guys to get used to that,” Morrisey said. “Everything we’re doing is highly vetted, and it’s going to continue. Our energy plan is no longer aspirational. It’s very realistic.”
His comments alluded to his gubernatorial predecessor, now-U.S. Senator Jim Justice, R-W.Va. As governor, Justice oversaw and heralded several large economic announcements for the state that often ended on lackluster terms — if they came to fruition at all.
In 2020 he celebrated recruiting Virgin Hyperloop to build its new Hyperloop Certification Center on about 800 acres between Tucker and Grant counties. The project was supposed to start in 2021, and would have allegedly employed thousands while contributing millions to the state economy, officials said. But the project never actually broke ground and likely never will.
In 2022 Justice lauded GreenPower Motor Company for signing an agreement with the state to open a manufacturing plant in South Charleston for the creation of zero-emission school buses. He said the company could bring up to 200 jobs for the area when it first opened and up to 900 in the future. Earlier this year — after both challenges between the state and the company as well as increased tariffs under President Donald Trump — the company began layoffs and halted production of the electric buses. Google lists the South Charleston facility as permanently closed. At the time of the layoffs, fewer than 100 people worked at the facility and only a fraction of the buses it promised the state had actually been produced.
In July of 2024, Justice announced a $150 million investment — including $50 million from the state — to help keep 600 people employed and reopen operations at the previously idled tin plant in Weirton. The facility was set to reopen and produce electrical transformers. Less than a year later, in May 2025, Cleveland-Cliffs pulled out of the deal. 
He also spearheaded work to reopen the Pleasants Power Plant; now, per the Charleston Gazette-Mail, court filings show state leaders were potentially misled out of $50 million in funds for retrofitting the station.
On Thursday, Morrisey was clear that he wants to see everything he announces actually come to fruition. Ensuring they do, he said, is crucial to West Virginia staying competitive economically, but specifically in the energy industry.
“Big things are coming to West Virginia and the announcements will come when I can look you in the eye and tell you, ‘This is real. It’s not fake.’ We’re done with all that nonsense. Done,” Morrisey said. “I want everyone across the globe to know West Virginia is becoming the energy powerhouse of America.”
Specific project announcements from Thursday’s address include:

$1.44 billion to extend the lives of existing coal plants. The state has partnered with major utility companies to keep six coal-fired power plants — among the dirtiest forms of energy — operating for up to 20 additional years. Doing so, Morrisey said, will save 10.5 gigawatts of generating capacity. Low-interest loans will be made available through the U.S. Department of Energy to help with the project.
$1.2 billion invested in a natural gas-fired power plant in Harrison County, which will be operated through a joint venture of private companies Kindle Energy, GE Vernova and Blackstone. Morrisey said the project will add 625 additional megawatts of power generation capacity to the grid and create 805 construction jobs. No state funds have been required for the project, he said.
$400 million investment from Ergon, Inc., a family-owned energy company in Hancock county. The company will be expanding its business to create 25 new jobs and will become the first company to partake in the state’s new PowerTech workforce training program.
$7 million investment from Bidell Gas Compression, in Weirton, to expand its existing facility and add up to 80 new manufacturing jobs. The state, Morrisey said, will be giving a $1 million “performance-based” loan to support the project.
Morrisey also celebrated several projects that had been previously announced, including $70 million from Diversified Energy to plug its own uncapped gas wells and a project from FirstEnergy for a new 1.2 gigawatt natural gas-fired power plant.

The state's infant mortality rate improved in 2024 from 2023, but still remains higher than the national rate, Harris said Thursday. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s infant mortality rate improved in 2024 but remains above the national average, according to data released Thursday by the Alabama Department of Public Health.
State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said Thursday that the state’s infant mortality rate was 7.1 babies per 1,000 live births in 2024, reflecting the rate of infants who died within their first year of life. That was down from 7.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023, he said.
“We care a whole lot about infant mortality, because we care about infants, and we want to ensure that they’re healthy and that they survive,” Harris said. “Infant mortality is a really interesting statistic in that there are so many different factors that go into producing your infant mortality statistic. It’s a great number to sort of describe the overall health of your society.”
There were 414 infant deaths in 2024, Harris said. Of those, 222 of the deaths were white babies and 176 were Black babies, the lowest recorded number for Black infants, he said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But infant mortality rates for Black Alabamians remain disproportionately high. The infant mortality rate among white Alabamians was 5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. For Black Alabamians, the rate was 11.8 per 1,000. In 2023, the rates were 5.7 and 13.1 deaths per 1,000 births, respectively. 
“This has, unfortunately, been the story for a long time,” Harris said. “We continue to have quite a disparity.”
Nearly 75% of babies born in Alabama are to white mothers, he said.
The nation’s infant mortality average is 5.5 deaths per 1,000 live births, Harris said. However, the state matches the nation’s trend since 1970.
Alabama, U.S. infant mortality 1970-2024. (Data from Alabama Department of Public Health)
In 1970, about 20 babies died per 1,000 births nationwide and about 24.5 died in Alabama. The rate started to descend after the implementation of Neonatal Intensive Care Units in the 1960s. In the late 1980s, Medicaid coverage was extended to pregnant women, which Harris said also contributed to the nationwide decline of infant deaths.
“If you have moms that are in good health, their babies are just likely to do better. If you have moms with cardiovascular disease and diabetes and those things that babies tend not to do as well,” Harris said.
In addition to mothers being healthy, adequate prenatal care is essential for a baby’s survival, Harris said. In 2024, 73.9% of all live births had what ADPH considers adequate prenatal care, depending on how many times a mother visits her OB/GYN. The statistic has been steady for the last 10 years, according to the data, with the lowest at 73.3% in 2019 and 2020 and the highest at 75.3% in 2015.
However, Harris said the percentage of live births with no prenatal care has been increasing since 2021. In 2024, 3.1% of live births in Alabama had no prenatal care. In 2019, 1.9% of babies did not receive prenatal care. The percentage steadily rose to 2.6% in 2020, then dipped to 2.2% in 2021 when more people qualified for Medicaid during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“With the Medicaid unwinding and other changes, that number has increased, unfortunately,” Harris said. “The number of moms getting adequate care stays the same, the number of moms getting no care, however, is going in the wrong direction.”

Risk factors and causes of death

The top five causes of infant deaths are congenital abnormalities, preterm births, sepsis, unintentional injuries and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), according to the data. SIDS fell two spots in cause of death from 2023, which Harris attributed to education and promotion of safe sleeping habits. 
Safe sleeping, Harris said, includes babies sleeping alone, on their back and in a crib. 
“What most people think is that most of those are probably airway related injuries, so maybe smothering,” Harris said in an interview after the meeting. “You do tend to see SIDS in unsafe sleep environments.”
Many things can contribute to infant mortality, like maternal age, smoking and chronic disease; preterm birth, low birth weight and congenital abnormalities. A mother’s income, race, level of education and ZIP code impact her baby’s chance of survival, according to the data. These factors also impact a mother’s access to health care. 
According to the data, the infant mortality rate is much higher in rural counties like Wilcox, Butler, Conecuh and Hale in the Black Belt, and Cherokee County in the northern part of the state. Those counties directly correlate with counties without hospitals that can deliver babies, according to the data.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care.

“When you look at the state as a whole, whether or not you have a delivery hospital is not correlated with an increase in mortality,” Harris said. “It still doesn’t strike me as a coincidence that our highest county rates don’t have delivery services.”
ADPH has nine programs related to infant mortality: Safe Sleep initiatives; Well Woman; family planning services; newborn screening; sexually transmitted infection/disease diagnosis and treatment; Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program; Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Fetal and Infant Mortality Review; and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
While ADPH can educate mothers on prenatal care, safe sleeping and encouraging no smoking while pregnant, the social and economic factors are harder to control, Harris said.
“We don’t necessarily have the tools in public health to address these differences by race, low income, access to health care, whether you have a provider,” Harris said. “We think people benefit by having a provider that they can have a relationship with and talk to and learn from and be educated.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1188-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 15:57:13.544526

The declaration has seven categories: Parental choice and responsibility; transparency and accountability; truth and goodness; cultural transmission; character formation; academic excellence; and citizenship. 
“These principles are principles that everyone across the board, on both sides of the aisle, can agree with. So, I’m excited to push this forward through the state Board of Education as a framework to continue to talk about what this board’s mission is for education,” Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas said.

The Heritage Foundation’s drafting committee for the statement included Erika Donalds, wife of U.S. Rep. and candidate for governor Byron Donalds, and Adam Kissel, a West Virginia resident and controversial appointee to the University of West Florida Board of Trustees. 
While a number of foundations and institutes have signed on, no state boards of education had signed on to it until Thursday.
The board passed it as a resolution, designed to show the public where the board stands. 
“We have got to transmit the knowledge of our history, warts and all, to future generations. America is not perfect, but you cannot point to another society in the history of mankind that is more perfect than the United States of America,” Petty said during the meeting.
Petty sees the declaration as a baseline, he said.
“It’s an imperfect society, occupied by imperfect human beings. We don’t agree on very much, it seems like we agree on less and less everyday, which is why we have to have some core principles we can rally around. We can argue over how to accomplish something, but if we can’t agree on what we’re trying to accomplish, we’re headed for disaster as a country,” Petty said.










“Schools should also foster a healthy sense of patriotism and cultivate gratitude for and attachment to our country and all who serve its central institutions. Our shared civic rituals, such as the Pledge of Allegiance and national anthem, should be respected and revived. Students should develop a deep understanding of and respect for our nation’s founding documents and the ideas they contain about ordered liberty, justice, the rule of law, limited government, natural rights, and the equal dignity of all human beings. Students should learn the whole truth about America — its merits and failings — without obscuring that America is a great source of good in the world and that we have a tradition that is worth passing on.”


– Excerpt from The Phoenix Declaration


The Heritage Foundation introduced the statement during the Conservative Vision of Education Conference in Phoenix in February. 
“Like the mythical phoenix rising from the ashes of its former self, we envision an education system that emerges stronger and more vibrant, building upon our nation’s foundational values while meeting the challenges of today,” Jason Bedrick, an education research fellow for Heritage who chaired the declaration’s drafting committee, said in announcing the document. 
Tiffany Justice, a Floridian and co-founder of Moms for Liberty, and Scott Yenor, a professor at Boise State University and dissuaded appointee for the UWF Board of Trustees, have also signed on to the declaration. 
The Florida Education Association and some public commenters at the meeting were not supportive of the board’s action.
“The Phoenix Declaration is the latest thinly veiled attempt by billionaire-backed special interests to dismantle and politicize Florida’s public education system,” the FEA claimed in a statement following the board vote. 
“Instead of chasing ideological agendas, the State Board of Education members should focus on what truly helps students: making sure public schools are fully funded, addressing the critical teacher and staff shortage, and guaranteeing that every child has access to a strong, neighborhood public school,” the FEA wrote. 
“Florida’s students and families deserve investment in their public schools, not a political pledge written by outside groups,” the FEA concluded.

(Photo by Kristine Sowl/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Three tribal governments and several environmental groups sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to try to block a land trade that would allow a road to be built through a national wildlife refuge in southwestern Alaska.
The land swap, approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior last month, would open up a section of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.
Supporters argue that the road is needed to connect the community of King Cove, home to about 750 people, with a legacy military airstrip that can accommodate jets. That would give King Cove’s residents access to safer medical evacuations if needed. Opponents say the proposed road — to run 18.9 miles in total, most of that within what is currently refuge land — would damage world-class bird habitat that is in the heart of the refuge.
Wednesday’s challenges came in three lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Anchorage. All assert that the land trade and road development pose dire threats to migratory bird populations that use Izembek’s wetlands, including species with Endangered Species Act listings, and to the wider ecosystem. All say the trade and planned road violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and other federal laws.
The three lawsuits have their individual characteristics as well.
One of them, filed by tribal governments in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta villages, focuses on threats to traditional subsistence hunters who depend on the birds that use Izembek’s wetlands. The tribal plaintiffs are the Native Village of Paimiut, Native Village of Hooper Bay and Chevak Native Village.
“Izembek’s eelgrass wetlands are a lifeline for emperor geese, black brant and other birds that feed our families and connect us to Indigenous relatives across the Pacific,” Angutekaraq Estelle Thomson, traditional council president of the Native Village of Paimiut, said in a statement. “Trading away this globally important refuge for a commercial corridor devalues our lives and our children’s future. We are joining this lawsuit because defending Izembek is inseparable from defending our subsistence rights, our food security and our ability to remain Yup’ik on our own lands.”
The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental organization, is also a plaintiff in the case.
A second lawsuit, filed by Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, Wilderness Watch, the Alaska Wilderness League and the Sierra Club, puts a special focus on the process used to achieve the land swap and what it may mean for all wildlife refuges.

	“Trading the ownership of refuge lands that Congress designated for conservation is a terrible precedent for the privatization of public lands. Building a road will have tremendous impacts on fish and wildlife habitat and could also greatly increase both disturbance and sport hunting pressure on vulnerable species,” Marilyn Sigman, president of Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, said in a statement.
The third complaint, filed by Defenders of Wildlife, puts a focus on the wider environmental impacts.
The planned road enabled by the land trade would “result in incalculable and irreversible damage” to myriad wildlife species, including marine and land mammals as well as migratory birds, that lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that the land deal violates both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the federal Wilderness Act.
“Under the Trump administration, the Interior Secretary entered into an illegal deal done in the darkness of a government shutdown: a sellout of one of our country’s largest and most pristine wildlife refuges and wilderness areas,” Jane Davenport, a senior attorney in Defenders of Wildlife’s Biodiversity Law Center, said in a statement. “Our treasured public conservation lands belong to all Americans. Defenders of Wildlife will stand up in court to hold this administration to account for recklessly and unlawfully trading them away.” 
The Izembek Lagoon area, where the road is planned, holds the largest single stand of eelgrass in the world and the largest bed of seagrass along the North American Pacific Coast, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The entire Pacific population of black brant, a type of goose, uses the refuge’s lagoon area, feeding on the eelgrass. The refuge and its eelgrass support several other bird and mammal species; about half the world’s emperor geese use the refuge as a migratory stopover, according to biologists.
A Department of the Interior spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on the lawsuits.
Last month, however, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum touted the land exchange and planned road as long overdue.
He spoke about the project during an event called “Alaska Day,” a gathering in Washington with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s three-member congressional delegation. The Izembek land exchange was one of the pro-development Alaska actions announced at the event.
“It just seems preposterous to me that somehow, it’s taken 40 years for us to put people first,” Burgum said at the event. “Because I know one thing as a governor of a state: You can actually do things like build 18 miles of gravel road and still take great care of wildlife.” Burgum was North Dakota’s governor before being appointed as Interior secretary.
The land trade he approved would convey a little less than 500 acres of refuge land, most of it designated wilderness, to the Native-owned King Cove Corp. The corporation would give 1,739 acres of its land to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be added to the refuge, and the federal government would also pay the corporation for the land.
The idea of a road linking King Cove to the World War II-era military runway at Cold Bay dates back decades. The legal and political battle over the proposal has also been long. Some of the plaintiffs in the new cases were plaintiffs in previous lawsuits over proposed land trades. The dispute was being considered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but that court in 2023 determined that the case was moot and dismissed it because the Biden administration was not pursuing the plan endorsed by the first Trump administration.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gubernatorial candidate Hannah Pingree on Thursday released her plan for improving Maine’s housing crisis. 
Pingree released her five-point plan to bolster affordable housing in the state at a press conference at a recently redeveloped senior housing complex in Portland. Throughout her campaign, the Democrat has said housing should be a top priority for the next governor and organized a statewide tour with roundtable discussions and town hall meetings centered around the issue. 
“I’m running for governor with a bold plan to build more homes, make housing attainable, and ensure families, workers and seniors can stay in the communities they love,” Pingree said. “Housing is a fight worth taking on and I’m ready to get it done.”
As the former head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, Pingree oversaw the creation of two reports that detailed the state of housing in Maine. The 2023 Housing Production Needs Summary showed Maine is short about 84,000 homes, while the 2025 Housing Production Roadmap outlined steps Maine lawmakers could take to start tackling the problem. 
Pingree said if elected she would invest $100 million a year to finance new construction and preserve existing homes in the state. This would include the expansion of programs to support first-time homebuyers and middle-income housing. 
Under the plan, the state would also limit the homes being sold to out-of-state investors and corporate landlords. It also includes working with Maine’s Attorney General’s office to strengthen fair housing protections and go after predatory companies that fail to meet health and safety standards and exploit tenants. 
Building more homes faster
In order to expedite the construction of new homes, Pingree recommends streamlining the permitting and approval processes. In addition to simplifying applications, she said she would set a 90-day permit processing time limit for most new projects.
The plan also highlights the need to develop the workforce to build this new housing stock.
Pingree said she would commit to permanently funding Maine’s free community college system to facilitate that pathway into construction trades. The system is currently in limbo as the scholarship program was only funded enough in the biennium budget to provide free school through the graduating class of 2025, though legislators have said they intend to revisit that next session.
In addition, Pingree calls for investments to support 1,000 pre-apprenticeships with companies and unions. 
“Hannah understands housing policy at a depth few others do,” said Kevin Bunker, founder of Developers Collaborative, a real estate group focused on affordable housing and smart growth, in a statement provided by the campaign. “She’s preserved affordable units, pushed zoning reforms, and advanced investments that will shape Maine’s housing market for decades.”
Reducing homelessness
Another plank of Pingree’s housing plan is focused on addressing homelessness, and the candidate pledged to end veteran homelessness in her first year in office, if elected. While her plan didn’t outline details for that promise, it does call for expanding support for school and family housing programs to address student homelessness. 
The plan also recommends the implementation of  regional homelessness hubs that partner with municipal governments to meet the individual needs of each county of the state.
“Hannah Pingree gets it. She’s out there talking to the people building homes and the families trying to afford them,” said Rep. Traci Gere (D-Kennebunkport), who is chair of Legislature’s Housing and Economic Development Committee. “She knows this crisis won’t be solved from the top down — it’ll be solved by Mainers working together, and she’s leading that charge.”

The commission approved a new dispensing license Wednesday. Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission approved a new dispensing license Wednesday, bringing the statewide total to 19, following a major patient enrollment threshold that triggered expansion under state law.
The commission’s executive director, Andrew Turnage, said the program surpassed the 25,000 active patients mark some time ago, which allowed the commission to approve the additional license. The commission voted unanimously to issue a dispensing license to FFD Georgia Holdings for a location in Atlanta. The company was the only applicant.
“I always like to share the update as it relates to the number of patients registered because we will likely be opening an application opportunity for our production licensees, and that means more access for patients,” Turnage said to the commission.

The program is also on track to approve additional licenses, with the number of active patients now at 33,314, tracking toward the 35,000 threshold. The law allows the commission to issue additional dispensing licenses after each increase of 10,000 patients after the 25,000 marker.
But despite some progress, the public comment period was dominated by urgent and frustrated statements from speakers who said the program’s framework is restrictive and limits access and effectiveness. The main complaints focused on product limitations and strict qualifying conditions, with patients, advocates and other members of the public calling for changes that would require legislative action.
Georgia’s program, which was created a decade ago, limits participation to patients with certain conditions, including cancer or seizure disorders. But for several of the conditions, state law requires the diagnosis to be severe or end stage. 
Lawmakers have considered expanding the program in recent years, and a House study panel is currently examining Georgia’s medical marijuana policies. 
Dr. Elmore Alexander, a medical director with U.S. 420 Doc, an online service providing medical cannabis card evaluations, said Georgia’s low-THC oil program lacks the necessary delivery methods to adequately treat patients with complex conditions. The program is “not a compassionate program,” he said, and currently prohibited methods, such as smoke inhalation, could help patients with conditions with sudden onset of symptoms like post-traumatic stress disorder.
“I don’t have enough products to take care of [my patients]. I don’t have enough,” Alexander said, arguing that the state needs to expand the program to include a greater variety of products that address different conditions.
Several speakers, including former Rep. Micah Gravley, a key figure in passing the Georgia medical cannabis law, called for removing the “severe and end-stage” caveats currently attached to many qualifying conditions. They argued that these vague terms create confusion for doctors because they aren’t medically based and prevent patients from accessing treatment before their conditions become terminal.
Gravley, who said he supports the state expanding the program, said the program’s limited scope was due to a lack of industry knowledge among lawmakers at the time the law passed.
“I think you had a lot of legislators who were very cautious, very nervous about doing this, and really saw the tone and tenor of parents who were bringing their children down, caregivers were giving testimonials about family members, and so they went out on a limb. Unfortunately, during that time, the limb was too short,” Gravley said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1000048932-scaled-e1763063844892-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-13 15:57:13.544526

(Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)Utah’s Gov. Spencer Cox is defending a plan hatched in conjunction with legislative leaders and the Utah Homeless Services Board and recently pitched to the Health and Human Services Interim Committee of the legislature. The plan provides both voluntary and involuntary housing for Salt Lake’s homeless in a 1,300-bed facility in “rural” northwest Salt Lake City. The proposal is early in the planning stages, and currently lacking funding.
Funding could ultimately prove to be prohibitive, since the project in effect amounts to a second state mental hospital, a large new substance treatment facility, and a vast new temporary shelter for the homeless folks with an affordable housing problem.
The State of Utah is trying to take up President Donald Trump’s advice to clean up criminal homelessness by removing folks from the streets, where they are doing drugs, committing crime, and engaging in “urban camping and loitering, and urban squatting.” The president’s executive order on the subject mentions “shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment,” but then refers to those placed there as “detainees,” using the nomenclature assigned to south-of-the-border arrestees currently being prepared for deportation out of our cities.
Is the president’s shining new program just a localized deportation program where due process and actual evidence of crime or mental illness may also be lacking? Maybe, maybe not. The president and the governor want “accountability,” but as with brown-skinned arrivals in America, they may want to make criminal judgments before due process is actually rendered.
Is the governor right in saying Utah has failed its duty to homeless citizens? Manifestly, yes. Is Utah right to go back to the days when the nation used involuntary commitment to inpatient mental health facilities to house aimless, mentally ill and unemployed people? Possibly so. Is the federal government approach a return to “one size fits all” national programming that leaves states without funding for programs that don’t present the right-sized shoe? It seems so. It is hard to miss the fact that the White House is driving this reform effort, rather than the people, professionals, and representatives of the state of Utah.
Homelessness is produced when a nation slides into slow-moving or quick-moving socio-economic decline. A number of social forces led to mental health deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s that kicked off the homelessness problem, including criticisms of public mental hospitals and a desire to give the mentally ill more connection with the mentally healthy community. Soon enough, America’s liberalized divorce laws scattered family members to the four winds, as did excesses in alcohol, tobacco, legal and illegal drugs, sports, porn and gambling, steeply declining standardized test scores in the school system, and our obsessive spending of money we have not yet earned.
America is not the first modern nation to experience rapid decline, however. World War I, the Russian Revolution, a famine, and a civil war combined within a space of five years to produce some seven million Russian homeless youths, who hastened the demise of the already deeply flawed new communist system there. India’s “untouchable” homeless class resulted from that ancient civilization’s hard turn away from democracy to unfeeling, unthinking oligarchy and aristocracy.
We did things differently in this country, at least in the beginning. Once our own founders secured their freedom, the first thing they did was mandate public education in law and classical political history, so citizens could understand the responsibilities attached to the wonderful rights of speech, press, voting, and religious freedom they had just won. Today, the lack of civics education even for the upper class has gotten the luxury-housed into the violent political mess we are in today. Maybe civics education could be a rehabilitating force for the homeless as well as the upper crust.
In spite of our sparkling new public education system, in the early decades of our country, shaky immigrant families often fractured in places like New York City, where they got off the boat. The governments, churches, and stable families of the nation noticed the problem and provided a solution by placing disorderly and orphaned children into farming families in far-away Ohio, who raised them as one of their own. Something similar happened when criminals were shipped off to the colonies by England during the 200 years before the Revolution. Communities took them in, taught them, and showed them how democracy was done. They integrated them into local communities where they had rights and responsibilities from the get-go.
Does America any longer have citizens willing to open the front door to the unhoused, undisciplined, unhealthy, and unenfranchised untouchables of our own society? Today we are furiously converting our population over to assigned places in either the lower- and middle-class commoner realm or the ornate, holier-than-thou, centi-millionaire and billionaire class. How are we going to fix that great impediment to republican progress?
Are we going to build a homeless encampment where folks can commune with each other on their own base level, stay removed from our hearts and minds, and be as far away from the East Bench, existing professional resources, and the newly secured Downtown Revitalization Zone as possible? Are we going to betray our promise to rehabilitate the unfortunate refuse of our insensate civilization? Money alone will not solve the problem, folks.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/resource-campus-rendering-1536x813-1-1024x542.webp,,,2025-11-13 15:57:13.544526

(File photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Redwood Materials officially started stripping cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper from used batteries it gathered over the past year at its new South Carolina facility.
The 600-acre campus in Berkeley County is the second new battery plant opened by the company founded in 2017 by a former Tesla executive. It follows the company’s first plant and headquarters in Nevada, which opened in 2019.
The $3.5 billion investment marks the largest single economic development project in South Carolina’s history.
Over the next year, Redwood’s South Carolina-based employees will gather 20,000 metric tons of lithium and other metals, eventually refining and remaking them into renewed battery components to sell back to U.S. battery manufacturers. That’s enough materials to build about 41,000 electric vehicle batteries, according to a company spokesperson.
Electric vehicle battery company halts construction of SC manufacturing plant

At full capacity, the factory is slated to produce enough to supply battery materials for more than a million electric vehicles, the company said when it first announced its plans in December 2022.
The company did not respond to questions from the SC Daily Gazette about how many people are working at the plant as part of this first phase or when it might ramp up its next round of hiring.
“We’ve now begun work on our second phase and will continue to ramp capacity over the next several years as additional facilities come online,” a statement reads.
Current job openings advertised include chemical, mechanical and automation engineers and a financial analyst.
Over the next decade, Redwood plans to hire a total of 1,500 workers for jobs paying some of the highest wages in Berkeley County — between $27 and $75 per hour.
South Carolina legislators approved a $226 million incentive package in December 2022 to pay for improvements to the property in the Camp Hall industrial park.
Redwood’s other campus in Nevada produced more than 60,000 metric tons of materials last year, which the company said put it on par with the largest U.S. source of nickel and made it the only domestic source of cobalt.

By comparison, Eagle Mine on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only operating nickel mine in the U.S., produced 17,000 tons of nickel in 2023, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The country imported 159,000 tons of the metal that year, largely from Canada.
Redwood calls the materials it plans to recycle the “backbone of our modern economy, powering everything from computers and smartphones to energy storage, defense systems, and AI data centers.”

Downtown Middletown restaurant marks its first anniversary with special events, live music, and community appreciation.
MIDDLETOWN, Del. — The Jackson House 302 is celebrating a major milestone this week — one year in business serving the Middletown community. The restaurant, known for its welcoming atmosphere, creative cocktails, and locally inspired dishes, kicked off its first-anniversary festivities with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 12, supported by a joint effort between the Middletown Area Chamber of Commerce and the New Castle County Chamber of Commerce.
The celebration marks a year of growth, creativity, and community connection for the locally owned restaurant, which has quickly become a centerpiece of Middletown’s dining scene.
“It’s been amazing and a lot of work,” said co-owner Hope Lopez. “We moved from Dover because we needed a bigger space for our loyal customers and to host events. We own four other restaurants, but Jackson House has been my baby. It’s something completely different for us, and the Middletown community has been fantastic.”
A Week of Celebration
The anniversary celebration began on November 10 with a weeklong slate of themed promotions designed to thank loyal guests and showcase the restaurant’s vibrant menu and hospitality. Each day offered something special — from signature cocktails to live music and giveaways.

Sunday, Nov. 10 – Lavender Elixir Day: Guests enjoyed 10% off Jackson House’s signature Lavender Elixir cocktail, one of the bar’s most popular drinks.
Monday, Nov. 11 – Pasta Lovers’ Night: The kitchen featured 15% off all pasta entrées, highlighting local favorites like house-made Alfredo and crab linguine.
Tuesday, Nov. 12 – Ribbon Cutting Event: The official one-year celebration featured door prizes, appetizers, drinks, cupcakes, a photo op, and more, with community members, staff, and local leaders in attendance.
Wednesday, Nov. 13 – Social Hour All Day: Guests enjoyed discounted drinks and appetizers throughout the day.
Thursday, Nov. 14 – Customer Appreciation Day: Loyal customers were invited to spin the prize wheel for a chance to win gift cards, free apps, cocktails, and other rewards.
Friday, Nov. 15 – Live Music Night: Local musicians performed in the evening, bringing energy and entertainment to the restaurant.
Saturday, Nov. 16 – Anniversary Brunch: The week wraps up with 15% off mimosas and specials on Jackson House’s famous brunch platter.

Community, Collaboration, and Celebration
At Tuesday’s ribbon cutting, members of both chambers praised the restaurant’s role in enriching the local dining scene and bringing people together.
“We’re here to celebrate the first anniversary of this amazing restaurant, Jackson House,” said Michelle Gramlich, CEO of the Middletown Area Chamber of Commerce. “It’s more than just a place to come to eat — it’s a place where our community comes together. Whether you’re coming for a date night, a meeting, or a celebration, you want to have it here. The food is phenomenal and the staff is incredible.”
The Jackson House 302 has become known for its blend of upscale yet approachable dining, creative cocktails, and community-centered events. For the Lopez family — who own several restaurants across Delaware — this location represents something new and deeply personal.
“I know we have magic here — we’ve created magic,” said Hope Lopez. “The Chef, Chamaigne Stone, and our manager and mixologist, Selena Alvarez — who’s also my daughter — have been amazing together.”
A Family Business with Heart
For co-owner Jose Lopez, the one-year milestone carries extra weight.
“Making it a year, really thriving, is a huge accomplishment, especially when you see what’s happening with some of our peers in this environment,” he said. “We owe it to our Chef, our amazing staff, and the community for making it happen.”
Lopez added that bringing The Jackson House to Middletown was a natural fit for both their family and the town’s growing downtown district.
“I feel like Middletown was ready for us,” he said. “They were asking for something like us to be here. You see a lot of chains, which are great, but there’s nothing like a local independent. You know, that unique flavor that only independents can bring.”
Looking Ahead
The ribbon cutting was not just a celebration of the past year, but also a reaffirmation of the restaurant’s long-term vision. The Jackson House team plans to continue expanding its local partnerships, hosting community events, and finding new ways to surprise guests with creative food and drinks.
The weeklong anniversary celebration continues through Saturday, November 16, culminating in a lively brunch that captures everything the restaurant has become known for — good food, good company, and genuine Delaware hospitality.
As it enters its second year, The Jackson House 302 stands as a testament to passion, teamwork, and the power of a shared vision — proving that with the right mix of creativity and community, a restaurant can become much more than a place to eat. It can become part of the neighborhood’s story.

So she wants voters to change the law, again.",Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/public-records/dizoglios-effort-to-audit-the-legislature-remains-stalled-so-she-wants-voters-to-change-the-law-again/,"The nascent ballot question campaign seeking to subject the Legislature and the governor’s office to the public records law has a new leader: Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who views the measure as a way to circumvent opposition to her effort to audit the House and Senate.","AUDITOR DIANA DIZOGLIO has a new idea for how to overcome the constitutional arguments that have stalled her voter-backed probe of the House and Senate: Go back to the ballot again and ask to make legislative records open to the entire public. 
In recent months, DiZoglio has essentially taken over as the leader of the campaign behind a ballot question that would subject both the Legislature and the governor’s office to the state public records law. 
She’s using the same playbook as last year’s audit question — which explicitly authorized her office to examine the Legislature and won a landslide victory at the ballot box — pulling together transparency advocates from both the right and the left. DiZoglio is also putting plenty of her own muscle behind the measure, including a $150,000 donation from her campaign account.  
DiZoglio, who previously served in the House and Senate and clashed with top Democrats, did not shy away from linking the latest effort to her long-running audit fight. That effort remains stalled, and legislative leaders continue to argue that an audit by her office would violate the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.  
If the new measure is successful, DiZoglio said, House and Senate higher-ups will no longer have the same avenue of resistance. 
“The documents that I have requested for the audit are matters of public record in every other entity that actually follows the public records law,” DiZoglio told CommonWealth Beacon. “If [lawmakers] don’t want to give the documents to me, I’m just going to work to make sure that those documents are given to you all directly and will take out their bogus constitutional limitations.” 
Unlike the audit question two years ago, though, DiZoglio did not launch the latest campaign herself. 
The Coalition for Healthy Democracy, a transparency organization led by former gubernatorial candidate Danielle Allen, filed the records measure in August alongside another question that would replace the state’s partisan primary system with an all-party primary. 
DiZoglio quickly announced her support for the records reform. In the ensuing weeks, she said, organizers decided to “divide and conquer”: The auditor would lead that campaign, while the coalition would focus on the measure overhauling the state’s primary elections. 
Now, DiZoglio is again working with activists from across the political spectrum who are frustrated with the opaque way the Legislature’s Democratic supermajority operates, gathering signatures needed to move closer to the 2026 ballot, and visiting both Democratic and Republican town committee meetings to drum up support. 
DiZoglio in late October donated $150,000 from her auditor campaign account to the nascent ballot-question campaign, deploying most of her available cash on hand. MASSterList first reported about the donation last week.
“If it’s on the ballot, I am confident that the voters will approve it, but we just need to get this issue on the ballot,” she said. 
The Methuen Democrat described the records-reform measure as a natural continuation of her work to wrench open the curtains behind which Beacon Hill works. 
Last year, nearly 72 percent of voters approved the ballot measure giving DiZoglio’s office the power to investigate the House and Senate.  
Supporters of every ballot question must collect signatures from at least 74,574 registered voters and file them with local election officials by the end of the day on Wednesday, November 19.  
That requirement is a steep hurdle, and every cycle it typically culls the field of measures in play from several dozen to just a handful. DiZoglio said the campaign is “in a good spot” ahead of the deadline. 
Massachusetts and Michigan are the only two states where both the governor’s office and the Legislature claim not to be subjected to their public records laws, according to The Boston Globe.  
The proposed ballot question would require both the Legislature and the governor’s office to comply with the existing records law, which already applies to executive offices, municipalities, and most other public agencies and government entities across the state. 
It’s an idea that power players have long hesitated to embrace. The Globe surveyed the entire Legislature earlier this year, and reported that only 12 percent of lawmakers think they should be required to follow the public records law. (Most legislators did not respond to the Globe’s outreach, let alone detail their opposition.) 
Asked in August about making more legislative records public, House Speaker Ron Mariano said “it depends on the definition of what opening up the laws are, and what you’re opening up.” 
“I think there are some things that are better left to negotiate in private, and I would prefer it that way,” Mariano said, according to the State House News Service. 
Gov. Maura Healey pledged after winning the election that she would not deem her office exempt from the law, but she soon reversed course. Healey’s team has released redacted versions of her monthly calendars listing events and meetings after the month ends, and denied several other requests for records related to stockpiling mifepristone, sexual harassment complaints and settlement agreements, and call logs. 
Under the ballot question, two types of records would remain exempt: documents related to developing policy positions, and communications between a legislative office and a constituent specifically related to help navigating a government agency or obtaining publicly-funded benefits. 
Groups backing the public records proposal include the right-leaning Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance and the left-leaning Act on Mass, which is also working on another measure curtailing use of legislative stipends.  
Lawmakers can earn significantly more for high-ranking positions in leadership or on committees, and skeptics argue that system financially disincentivizes rank-and-file lawmakers from disagreeing with leadership. 
Act on Mass executive director Scotia Hille said the question is “targeted directly at Beacon Hill’s power structures that allow the inaction and lack of transparency we’ve seen over the years accumulate.” 
“The expansion of this system has coincided with the disappearance of debate and public dissent in the state Legislature, stalling progress,” Hille said. “It’s just a simple fact that our elected representatives shouldn’t have to weigh their livelihood every time they go take a vote.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Auditor-Diana-DiZoglio.webp,,,2025-11-13 16:58:27.401092

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A Wisconsin Assembly committee deadlocked 6-6 Wednesday on a Republican-authored bill to prevent the broadly popular Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program from lapsing next year. 
The program, which allows the state Department of Natural Resources to purchase, conserve and maintain public land enjoys bipartisan support among Wisconsin residents. However a subset of Republican legislators have soured on the program’s intentions, arguing too much land has been pulled off local property tax rolls in northern Wisconsin. Republicans have also complained that a state Supreme Court decision removed their authority to conduct oversight of the program. 
Previously, members of the Joint Committee on Finance had the ability to anonymously hold up stewardship projects. 
Republicans in the Legislature stripped money to re-authorize the program out of the state budget earlier this year and both parties have proposed competing pieces of legislation to keep it running beyond 2026. 
On Wednesday, the Assembly Committee on Forestry, Parks and Outdoor Recreation took up the Republican bill, authored by Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc). Democrats and environmental groups have been unsupportive of the Kurtz bill since its initial release because it requires that any attempt by the DNR to acquire land at a cost of more than $1 million be approved by the full Legislature through standalone legislation. 
Critics have argued the full legislative process is the opposite of what the Court intended when it took the anonymous hold power away from JFC, that the Legislature could never move quickly enough for the speed at which real estate transactions must sometimes take place and the public nature of legislation could scare off potential sellers. 
Earlier this week, Kurtz released a proposed amendment to his bill that would lower the threshold requiring legislative approval from $1 million to $250,000. 
A Democratic proposal, which was introduced as a separate bill this summer and offered as an amendment to the Republican bill this week, would create an independent board, nominated by members of both parties, to oversee the program outside of the legislative process. 
On Wednesday, the committee voted 7-5 in favor of accepting Kurtz’s amendment to his bill. Rep. Paul Melotic (R-Grafton) voted with the committee’s four Democrats against the amendment. 
But on the vote to advance the bill out of committee, Reps. Calvin Callahan (R-Tomahawk) and Rob Swearingen (R-Rhinelander) joined the Democrats to vote no, resulting in the 6-6 tie.
When an Assembly committee votes for a bill, it reports the bill to the full Assembly floor and recommends that it be passed. According to Assembly rules, when a committee ties on a vote, the chair of the committee has the discretion to report the bill to the full Assembly “without recommendation.” 
The bill has already been reported to the full Assembly for a potential vote, according to the office of Rep. Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz), the committee’s chair.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point), a co-author of the Democratic proposal, said “Wisconsin Democrats are united in their support and vision for Knowles-Nelson,” while “Republicans cannot seem to agree on a path forward.”
Charles Carlin, the director of strategic initiatives at the non-profit land trust organization Gathering Waters, told the Wisconsin Examiner that Wednesday’s vote shows the only way to save the program is with a bill that can get support from both parties. 
“Today’s hearing was a missed opportunity for bipartisan cooperation on the Knowles-Nelson stewardship program,” Carlin said. “There is ample room for compromise across the aisle. But today’s deadlocked committee vote demonstrates that no reauthorization is going to move forward without buy-in from both parties. The hearing should motivate legislators on both sides of the aisle to come together and work out a compromise that keeps Knowles-Nelson working for Wisconsin.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The State Board of Education voted Thursday to release for public comment amended rules for Arkansas’ school voucher program that include new restrictions on how much funding can be used for extracurriculars.
Created in 2023 by the LEARNS Act, a wide-ranging K-12 education bill, the Educational Freedom Account Program allows state funds to be used for allowable educational expenses, such as private school tuition, technological devices and extracurricular activities. The program was rolled out over three years with increasing eligibility, and opened to all students for the first time this fall. 
EFA students receive up to 90% of the annual per-student public school funding rate. For the 2025-2026 school year, EFA participants may each be allotted up to $6,864 in state funding.  More than 51,000 students applied for the current school year, according to an ADE dashboard. If all of them are approved and awarded the full amount, it would cost the state more than $354 million.
UPDATED: Private school tuitions rise as Arkansas voucher program enters third year

The EFA rules presented to the education board Thursday were written over a year ago, but have been revised, said Stacy Smith, deputy commissioner of the Division of Elementary and Secondary Education. Changes to the rules include defining universal eligibility, establishing a fixed application window, revising payment schedules and administrative fees, and clarifying qualifying expenses, Smith said. 
Some of the revisions stem from Act 920 of 2025, which prohibits EFA participants from using more than 25% of their allocated funds for extracurricular activities, physical education activities or educational field trips within the state of Arkansas. The law was seen as a response to public backlash over how EFA funds were being used for things outside of a traditional education curriculum, like horseback riding lessons. 
Sen. Breanne Davis, a Russellville Republican who sponsored both the LEARNS Act and Act 920, told the Senate in April that the goal of the latter legislation was to ensure the money goes toward education-related items. 
The revised rules were presented to the board during a work session Wednesday, but some board members still had questions Thursday. The biggest concern involved prohibiting EFA funds from being used for team sports. The proposed rules note that extracurricular activities don’t include “team sports or club sports, whether recreational or competitive.” The proposed rules also explicitly exclude EFA funds from being used for equipment, recreational fees, travel costs and dues. 
Darrell Smith, assistant commissioner of the Office of School Choice and Parent Empowerment, said the original intent around the team sports provisions was to address travel or club teams that can become “very, very expensive.” Prior to the 25% cap on extracurriculars, Smith said a lot of the EFA money, which “is there to help educate a child,” could have been spent on these elite sports teams.


Let us know what you think...


 

State education board member Jeff Wood said he “could get behind that rationale,” but was concerned that the current language “might go too far” because it would prohibit students from using the funding to participate in school-sponsored sports teams, which are a “regular part of a student experience in school.”
Wood said he’s heard from lawmakers who are concerned that the rules don’t allow what they were thinking when the law was passed, and proposed spending a few more weeks working on the rules before releasing them for public comment. 
“I hate for us to put something out there that stirs a pot of confusion and potentially chaos that we don’t have to stir,” Wood said. 
ADE Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford asked the board to consider that tabling the rules would create a further delay in the process. The purpose of the 30-day public comment period is to engage in discussions with the wider public, which can inform potential revisions to the proposed rules, Salas-Ford said. Voting not to release the rules prevents ADE from posting them on its website or emailing school districts about the rules, she said. 
“To me that is hindering the process more so than it is encouraging it. Of course it’s still your decision on which to do, but I don’t feel like that’s going to get us any closer to where we want to be,” Salas-Ford said. “When you release these for public comment, you are simply voting to release them, not that you endorse the rules as they are written.”

Board member Gary Arnold acknowledged that Wood made “a great point,” but said ADE staff was “swaying me on the basis of expediency.” Arnold made a motion to release the revised EFA rules for public comment if the board could have another work session on the rules. Arnold said he felt “rushed” at Wednesday’s workshop.
“I want to just increase trust that there’s no railroading, no railroading down of things that we could have been aware of but we were not made aware of,” he said.
Board member Aaron Abbott seconded the motion, which the board approved. Wood was the only member to vote “respectfully, no.”
The board also unanimously approved for public comment rules governing the Arkansas Adult Diploma program, which is for adults who don’t have a high school diploma, but are not seeking a GED. The rules already existed, but were revised “because of legislative changes and updates,” Smith said. Revisions to the rules include amending the definition of milestones and clarifying the payment associated with each milestone, she said. 
The public comment period lasts 30 days, and if there are “substantive changes,” the rules will be revised and sent out again for another public comment period, Smith said. Once the public comment process has concluded, a final draft of the rules will be presented to the education board for approval. The rules will then advance to the Arkansas Legislative Council for final approval. 
Smith said she anticipates “a lot of public comment” on the EFA rules, so it could take a couple rounds of public comment before a final draft is ready. Public comment periods include a public hearing, and Salas-Ford said ADE might host two meetings for the EFA rules to allow more opportunities for the public to provide feedback.
Draft rules and a timeline for the comment public periods will be posted on ADE’s website.

Ron DeSantis and CFO Blaise Ingoglia’s campaign to scale back or eliminate homesteaded property taxes drew a rebuke from a former Republican state lawmaker Wednesday night during a discussion with Ingoglia and tax policy experts.
“It’s not really a proposal, it’s a bumper sticker, right?” said Jeff Brandes, who served in the Florida Legislature representing parts of Pinellas County from 2010-2022.
“It’s a bumper sticker without any policy behind it. What we’ve seen so far is simply a statement without any explanation of how we’re going to pay for the government services beyond that, other than simply we’re going to cut them out.”
During the event at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Ingoglia called that “a false premise.”
“I think there is more than enough room to cut local budgets, probably by the amount of 15%, and not even worry about taking away any money for essential services,” he said.
The chief financial officer has made several high-profile visits to some of the state’s largest cities to allege that his team of auditors found local governments have engaged in hundreds of millions of dollars of what he has labeled “wasteful and excessive spending.”
DeSantis declared at the beginning of this year that he supports the idea of reducing, maybe outright eliminating, property taxes in Florida — which would make Florida the first state in the nation to do so. Since then, GOP lawmakers have offered proposals that would affect only homesteaded properties and does not touch funding for schools or law enforcement.
DeSantis’ dismissals
Last month, eight House Republicans filed legislation to achieve those goals, with seven of them offered as proposed constitutional amendments that would go before the voters as in November 2026. DeSantis promptly dismissed the proposals, saying that placing more than one property tax measure on the ballot was simply an “attempt to kill anything on property taxes.”
The governor vetoed $1 million placed in the final state budget sent to him by lawmakers in June to study the consequences of eliminating property taxes. Brandes said that response shows DeSantis is not serious about what he’s calling for.
“Listen, if you went to the doctor and he said, ‘We’re planning to cut out this organ,’ we could do a study to figure out what would happen if we did that. But we’re not planning to do that, we’re just going to cut it out and see what happens. You would call that malpractice, right?” Brandes asked.
“But, at the end of the day, what do we have here in Florida? We have the governor who says, ‘We’re going to rip out the foundation of this house. We’re going to rip out this organ. But we’re not going to tell you what happens afterwards,’ and somehow that’s not malpractice? That is malpractice. This is policy malpractice, not medical malpractice, but that’s what we’re debating here.”
Brandes, who now heads a think tank called the Florida Policy Project, said his major objection is that there is “no explanation” about how the state could eliminate or substantially reduce homesteaded property taxes and continue to function effectively.
“Are we going to cut police and firefighters? No, they say we’re not going to do that,” he continued. “Are we going to double the sales tax? Maybe. Are we going to watch cities and counties bump up their millage on renters and small business owners? Likely, because most counties are not at the top of their millage.
“And so what we aren’t hearing is what comes next. You’re only hearing, ‘We’re only going to cut property taxes on homesteaded properties.’ They don’t want to tell you what comes next. And this is my problem. You deserve transparency. You deserve accountability. And what this plan does is, it removes transparency and it removes accountability.”
On that point, Ingoglia agreed.
“Sen. Brandes is right. There should be a plan,” he said, adding that the governor’s office as well as the House and Senate “were running numbers” to provide more information.
Brandi Gunder, vice president for research at Florida TaxWatch, and Dr. Esteban Santis, director of research with the Florida Policy Institute, also participated in the “Debate-a-Bull” forum hosted by the USF Institute for Public Policy & Leadership.
In 2024, the total amount of property taxes collected statewide in Florida was $55 billion, with counties taking in $19.6 billion and cities receiving $8.6 billion, according to a report from the Florida Chamber of Commerce. School districts, independent special districts and municipal service taxing units account for the remainder.
Disparity among neighbors on property taxes
Something all the speakers agreed about is that Florida homeowners generally get significantly larger property tax breaks than do new homebuyers. That’s due to the state’s Save Our Homes amendment, which caps the annual increase on the assessed values of primary residences to 3% (or the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index).
“If you’re a first-time homebuyer, if you’re in the market out there, you are going to be paying higher property taxes than your neighbor,” Santis said.
“The people who are angry about property taxes are not the people who have been living in their homes for 20 years,” Brandes added. “But if you bought during the pandemic and now you’re paying the full fare, those are the people who are up in arms.”
“Reducing the burden on your principal interests — your tax principal interests, taxes, and insurance payment that you’re paying out — is disproportionately hurting new homebuyers,” Ingoglia acknowledged.
Florida imposes a 6% sales tax. To fully offset elimination of all ad valorem taxes, that would have to increase to 14% to make up the difference, the Florida Chamber of Commerce white paper reported. If the state were to make up all homestead property taxes with sales taxes, it would only need to be increased to 8.85%. That doesn’t take into account that many counties have a 1% or 1.5% local sales tax which presumably would also have to be replaced.
Ingoglia questioned those numbers.
“They’re all deriving their numbers on the assumption that government needs all of the revenue that they’re taking in right now,” he said. “I’m telling you, they’re taking in way more money than they’re expected to.”
The CFO’s audits have included “reasonable” increases in inflation and population in determining how much a local government has been overspending, but Santis countered that government expenditures are different than for household goods, although they do overlap on items like energy and fuel costs.
“Typically, we don’t think of government going to the store to pick up eggs,” Santis said. “What they’re doing is, they’re paying for teachers. They’re paying for law enforcement. They’re paying for sanitation. They’re paying for emergency services and they’re paying the personnel costs, the fringe benefits to all of that.”
Ingoglia accurately noted that most popular opinion polls have indicated that the idea of eliminating property taxes on homesteaded properties is “overwhelmingly popular.”
Brandes wasn’t buying it.
“What question did we ask, right? If I just came out and said, ‘Hey listen. Who wants to cut their property taxes?’ Boy everybody would say, ‘Yeah, absolutely.’ But I don’t tell you the other half of the equation. ‘Oh, and we’re going to raise X. Oh, and we’re going to turn your cities and counties into dependents which have to go ask Tallahassee for money to hire police and firefighters. Or to fill potholes every year.’ Then maybe we get a different answer.”

DemasThe fight against election disinformation and changes to Michigan’s petition circulation process cleared the upper chamber of the state Legislature on Thursday.
Senators moved the legislative package with bipartisan support.
Among the bills were Senate Bill 529, Senate Bill 530 and Senate Bill 531, sponsored by Democratic state Sens. Jeremy Moss of Bloomfield Township and Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor.
The Irwin-Moss bills would ban petition organizers from paying circulators per signature, joining other states that have banned financial incentives for circulators to lie to voters for support; require circulators to direct potential signers to a factual summary of the ballot proposal’s contents and purpose before collecting their signature; and ensure that only one signature is counted if two identical signatures appear on a single petition.
“Every election cycle, we hear reports of petition circulators engaging in deceptive practices that erode faith in the process to place candidates and proposals on the ballot. A person should be able to grow support for their cause based on its own merit, not by misrepresenting what the petitions will do,” Moss said in a statement. “We must set up the safeguards needed to ensure voters can participate in an effective and trustworthy process to help shape the future of our state.”

Irwin, in a statement, said that when citizens participate in direct democracy, they should know that their signatures were counted as valid and not thrown out in the screening process.
“Michigan has a lively democracy that produces a lot of initiative petitions, and it can be hard for even the most informed voter to keep track of whether they have already signed a particular version of a petition,” Irwin said. “Multiple signatures from the same person are all thrown out under current law, disenfranchising citizens. My bill has a simple solution: if a person signs more than once, one and only one signature would be counted. Senate Bill 531 would give citizens the confidence to sign petitions they support without fear that they might run afoul of the law or inadvertently invalidate their own signature.”
The package also includes Senate Bill 533, which passed earlier this year and was sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Mary Cavanagh of Redford Township.
Cavanagh’s bill would ban false statements or misrepresentations concerning elections, ensuring that bad actors would be fined and penalized.
“As someone who has been an election worker, I have witnessed firsthand the detrimental impacts that election disinformation can have on our democracy,” Cavanagh said in a statement. “In recent years, we have witnessed targeted disinformation campaigns within some of the most underserved communities in our state, like posting signs telling folks that polling places are closed or disingenuous robocalls with false election information aimed at restricting Michiganders’ right to vote.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel both praised the passage of the legislation.
“Petitions are meant to reflect the will of the people. But too many candidates and bad actors have manipulated our state’s petition circulation process for their own financial or political gain,” Benson said in a statement. “These bills will ban financial incentives to generate fraudulent signatures on petitions and require that circulators provide a factual summary of the proposal’s contents. Michigan voters deserve to know the truth about what they’re being asked to sign, and these bills ensure they will get it.”
Nessel, in a statement, said the voters deserve confidence, fairness and security in their election systems.
“The improvements outlined in this package will help encourage civic engagement statewide, while closing a loophole in our current statute which we have seen bad actors misuse for their fraudulent aims,” Nessel said. “I applaud the Senate for advancing this vital legislation and will continue my advocacy for its passage as it moves to the House.”
Although the Republican-controlled House has been a proponent of election integrity and new security measures, it remains unclear if they will go for the largely Democratic-led Senate package.
The Irwin-Moss bills were referred to the House Election Integrity Committee after passage on Thursday, but Cavanagh’s bill was referred to the House Government Operations Committee when it passed the Senate in September – a committee known in Lansing as the place where legislation goes to die. The latter committee has yet to hold a hearing on Cavanagh’s bill.
Earmark transparency bills also pass
Meanwhile, the Senate also passed legislation creating a 45-day window for new legislative earmarks before they can come up for a vote in the upper chamber.
The bills – Senate Bill 596 and House Bill 4420 – passed unanimously.
Senators were volleying between a shorter 10-day window and a 60-day window proposed by state Sen. Jim Runestad of White Lake, also the chair of the Michigan Republican Party. 
GOP House Speaker Matt Hall of Richland Township also previously said that he would not entertain any Senate version of earmarks reform, which had its roots this year to changes in House rules and the protracted budget fight, without a long period to dissect where the earmarks were going and who would benefit from them.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Pennsylvania’s Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman pushed back against criticism of his decision to vote with Republicans to end the nation’s longest government shutdown as other members of his party demanded concessions on expiring health care tax credits.
“I absolutely support extending those tax credits, but for me, the kind of chaos and holding our government hostage is unacceptable, and you actually move against my party’s values,” Fetterman said in an hour-long interview with NPR’s Scott Detrow.
Since the interview aired Tuesday, Fetterman was hospitalized after falling during a morning walk near his home in Braddock. A spokesperson said Fetterman suffered ventricular fibrillation that caused him to become light-headed and fall, suffering minor injuries to his face. He is under observation in a Pittsburgh hospital.
Fetterman has frequently found himself at odds with the majority of his party in the first three years of his term. He addressed his position as a discordant voice in his party on the war in Gaza and his future as a Democrat as well as his new book “Unfettered.”  

It chronicles his 2022 campaign, the near-fatal stroke that almost derailed it and the severe depression that followed.
“When you hear the expression that you can’t get out of your bed, like, I thought, now that’s not really right,” Fetterman said. “That is true. I couldn’t get out of bed. That’s part of the lie that you start to tell yourself about depression, and that’s when it really becomes dangerous, when it pushes you into the final argument of ‘now it’s time to take yourself out.’”
Fetterman underwent treatment for more than a month at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2023 and stood out in politics for his willingness to talk about the experience. But Fetterman said in the interview he doesn’t regret doing so despite opponents using it “to create an impression that’s just not true.”
“I know that’s not necessarily a big political winner to talk about these things. And I think I was the first elected official to do that,” he said, adding that he feels he can better help others experiencing depression as a result of his candor. “I don’t know what your recovery looks [like] but as long as you stay in it, I promise you, you will get better.”
“I’ve described it as like a … dark gift. I wouldn’t ask for it, but if you’ve had it, you can appreciate life being on the other side,” he said.
In his book, Fetterman also writes about his relationship with Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and a rift they have never resolved. It stemmed from disagreements over the cases of inmates seeking mercy before the Board of Pardons, where they served when Fetterman was lieutenant governor and Shapiro was state attorney general.
Fetterman, who favored leniency, writes Shapiro was more cautious and Fetterman started to believe that his decisions on the board were influenced by political ambition. His frustration mounted to the point that he called Shapiro a “f—ing a–hole” on a live microphone.
Detrow questioned Fetterman about his relationship with Shapiro, asking if what Fetterman wrote was true that they had no working relationship and don’t talk.
“The disagreement began on the Board of Pardons … primarily on brothers that were innocent and I didn’t want them to die in prison, and that’s where it started, and that’s where it ended,” Fetterman said, adding that he and Shapiro have been part of meetings and political fundraisers together. He said the fact they haven’t spoken “isn’t new news,” and they “don’t have any significant differences on our political views.”
Fetterman didn’t say if he’s made a decision about running for reelection. “Talking about ‘28, who knows about that? It’s like, how long?” he said, adding, “What’s important to me [is] that I’m not changing the party.”
Democratic colleagues and voters have faulted Fetterman for working with GOP Senators on legislation and adopting a position on immigration that more closely aligns with Republicans than his own party. Fetterman told Detrow he stands behind his voting record, which he described as following his caucus 90% of the time. He denied that he has considered switching parties. 
“This is the most purple state in the country, and a lot of people you know and love voted for the other side, and they’re not fascists.  They’re not Nazis,” Fetterman said. “They’re not trying to destroy our constitution and our democracy. And now trying to find a way forward, is where I’m in.”
Asked about the Democratic party’s disconnect with men and the working class, Fetterman said it’s due to cancel culture and the implication that working people who vote Republican are voting against their own interests. 
“And so this idea is the wrong approach, saying you’re wrong,” he said. “‘Are you dumb?’ You know, it’s like, ‘no, you have different values,’ and that’s why I respect them and try to find a way forward to make the appeal.”
Fetterman said he believes former Vice President Kamala Harris made a grave mistake by labeling President Donald Trump a fascist during the 2024 campaign because it alienated voters who had supported him in the past and who Democrats were working to win over. He added that he  doesn’t see himself as a gatekeeper of what’s within norms.

He cited the Trump administration’s decision to demolish the East Wing of the White House to make way for a ballroom. Fetterman said it’s a reasonable concern that the residence lacks a space large enough for major events.
“It was shocking to actually raze a part of the White House, but, but for me, like, that’s not, that’s not my hill,” Fetterman said.
Asked what his hill was, Fetterman said, “for me, it’s the expression, sometimes you pick your battles, and sometimes they pick you. And for me, you know that that quickly became Israel.”
Detrow asked Fetterman whether he ever second guessed his pro-Israel stance as the death toll in Gaza mounted into the tens of thousands.
“We have to talk about the context of what Israel was able to accomplish … because they were able to neutralize and destroy Hamas, and the same with Hezbollah, and then they had an opportunity to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities. I was the only Democrat that supported that,” Fetterman said, adding that he happens to agree with Trump about supporting Israel’s response.
U.S. forces followed Israel’s initial attack with a June 21 airstrike by B-2 stealth bombers on three heavily fortified nuclear weapons development sites. The action drew criticism from Democrats who said it exceeded the president’s authority to use military force without congressional approval.
Fetterman also questioned whether the ongoing violence in Gaza should be blamed on Israel’s bombing or Iran-funded proxies such as Hamas or Hezbollah. He also said “no one breaks down how many actual Hamas fighters or other people” were killed. 
“Why can’t people condemn putting tunnels under hospitals and embedding themselves in where civilians are?” Fetterman asked, adding the continued existence of Hamas is an obstacle to ending the violence and rebuilding Gaza.
“That’s part of the tragedy. That’s why you have to destroy and neutralize Hamas. That’s a cancer, that’s an absolute cancer, and I want the very best for the innocent Palestinians. They deserve to live in peace, and I hope they can,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2200949176-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 14:57:32.642433

Ramesh Kolluru will fill the vacant presidency at UL Lafayette for the time being after current interim president Jamie Hebert stepped down to return to his position as provost. Kedrick Nicholas will step in as interim president at McNeese State in Lake Charles after his predecessor, Wade Rousse, stepped down to become president of the LSU System. 
It had been rumored that Kolluru would be appointed ULL president on a permanent basis without a formal search from the UL System board. But after backlash from the ULL faculty, Board Chairman Mark Romero announced he would appoint a search committee to find a new president. 
Kolluru, who is still favored to get to position after the search, is currently ULL’s vice president for research, innovation and economic development, a position he has held for more than a decade. 
Kolluru said UL System President Rick Gallot asked him Monday to apply for the president’s position, though the position had not yet been officially opened to other applicants.
Kolluru said he was glad the board will conduct a search. 
“The process to the point has not been transparent, and I’m glad that the process now has evolved to an actual search process that’s inclusive of the entire campus community,” Kolluru said. 
Members of the search committee and the timeline for choosing ULL’s next president have not yet been announced. 
Nicholas has been senior vice president of student affairs at McNeese since July 2024 and is a two-time alumnus of the university. Board members did not say when they would begin searching for a permanent president.",,,,2025-11-13 14:57:32.642433

Beshear, a Democrat, announced the news in his weekly press conference, adding that he had just learned of the federal guidance moments before and would provide more information about the timing of the payments at a later time. 
Government reopens after 43 days: Trump signs bill ending record shutdown

The Kentucky governor had joined a lawsuit with more than two dozen Democratic state officials suing the Trump administration for halting funds from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to 42 million Americans, including around 600,000 Kentuckians, during the government shutdown. 
“Let me just say that this didn’t have to happen in this shutdown,” Beshear said Thursday. “This is the first president that has ever refused to pay SNAP benefits during a shutdown. Two courts told him that he could pay full benefits during a shutdown, and he went to court to try to not pay those full benefits.”
The lawsuit is still pending. The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court’s order that the Trump administration pay for a full month of food benefits.
The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history ended Wednesday.  
Beshear said that state employees worked through the night of Nov. 6 after the initial court ruling to begin processing partial SNAP payments for Kentuckians. 
He later added that the “middle of the month” is when most Kentuckians who use SNAP will likely see dollars come into their accounts. Because some partial payments have been issued already, the process is more complicated than it normally would be. 
Other federal programs that help Kentuckians are set to resume now that the government shutdown is over, Beshear said. One such program is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, known in Kentucky as KTAP or Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program. He said Kentucky provided state funding during the federal shutdown to keep the small cash payments flowing to low-income families and would be reimbursed. 
Asked about congressional Democrats who broke ranks to vote with Republicans to reopen the government, Beshear said that his goal “is to make the best of” the shutdown ending “as we move forward for Kentucky.” 
A handful of Senate Democrats gave the stopgap funding measure the necessary votes to end the shutdown. Democrats failed to win their major demand, an extension of tax credits that hold down health insurance costs for millions of Americans.
“There aren’t winners in a shutdown, but I think the American people very clearly saw who was fighting for their health care and who didn’t care if their health care premiums went up, and they saw who was willing to let people go hungry and who wasn’t,” the governor said.
Two Kentucky Republicans — Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie — voted against the temporary spending bill that reopened the government. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, also voted against it.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54392971083_6a04f0b70f_6k-1024x6831761681275-1.jpg,,,2025-11-13 14:57:32.642433
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-13 19:09:02+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Report: Affordability gap grows for those seeking starter homes,Katie Castellani | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/housing/report-affordability-gap-grows-for-those-seeking-starter-homes/,"Home prices and rents have flattened in 2025 but are still “historically” high, according to a report released by The Boston Foundation and Boston Indicators.","WHILE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION is up and home prices have stabilized, researchers expect home buyers and renters will continue to face affordability headwinds in Massachusetts.
Home prices and rents have flattened in 2025 but are still “historically” high, according to a 108-page Greater Boston Housing Report Card 2025 released by The Boston Foundation and Boston Indicators on Wednesday.
“It’s easy to get lost in the numbers of units, permits, and cost burdens, but we must remind ourselves that at the end of the day, we are talking about real homes, families and communities,” Lee Pelton, CEO and president of the foundation, said in a statement.
While the gap between who can afford to live in the Greater Boston area and who can’t continues to widen, “these trends are not inevitable,” Pelton said during an event Wednesday where the report was unveiled.
“They reflect choices, policy choices, investment choices and collective priorities that we have the power to change,” he said.
The annual income a household needs to afford an “entry-level” home rose from about $98,000 in 2021 to more than $162,000 in 2025, assuming a 3.5 percent down payment, according to the report. This trend is squeezing renters out of making the leap to home ownership. Just 15 percent of renter households can afford an “entry-level” home – down from 30 percent in 2021.
“The data show just how much work we have to do if we are to expand opportunities and unfreeze the market,” Luc Schuster, executive director of Boston Indicators, TBF’s research arm, said in a statement.
Renters continue to face stiff prices.
The Greater Boston area has the fifth most expensive rental market in the country in 2025, according to the report, which cited the Zillow Observed Rent Index that tracks changes in market rents across housing types.
New York, San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego were the only four markets with higher rental prices than Boston. In September 2025, the ZORI found rent for the Boston area was almost $3,000 per month, not including other housing costs like heat, electricity and water.
Rents across all neighborhoods within Boston metro core communities have risen since 2022, but increases slowed in some areas since 2024. Also, more than half of renters in Greater Boston are “cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. More than one-quarter of renters spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent, meaning they are considered “severely cost-burdened.” Renters of color are cost burdened at higher levels, according to the report.
The report also noted that the rates of “cost-burdened” and “severely cost-burdened” may be overstated because the estimates – based on American Community Survey data – might inflate the cost burden for those in subsidized housing. Still, many in the region face affordability pressures.
A shortage of rental units in Boston is one of the main drivers for the city’s high rent prices. While vacancy rates across most major US cities have fallen in the past two decades, Boston’s was particularly low – just 3 percent in 2024. However, the report noted there are early indicators that vacancy rates may be rising in some neighborhoods with more students, likely because of a drop in international student enrollment under President Donald J. Trump’s immigration policies.
Census Address Counts, a dataset from the Census Bureau tracking a list of addresses, show that the Greater Boston area created more than 70,000 homes since 2020, marking a steady increase, according to the report.
But, the best available data on new construction permits, which are seen as a key indicator for future housing construction, have dropped. As of July 2025, the number of new permits issued are 44 percent below the levels for the same period in 2021. High construction costs and interest rates have made funding projects more difficult and are a key cause of the slowdown, especially when compounded with existing barriers like restrictive zoning, costly building code requirements and lengthy approval processes, according to the report.
The report noted that declining permitting doesn’t bode well for Gov. Maura Healey’s goal of constructing 220,000 additional homes in the state between 2025 and 2035. Since Healey took office in 2023, 90,400 homes have been “completed, started construction, or proposed,” according to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.
While it looks like the state is making progress on its goal, most of the 90,400 homes were built or permitted before 2025. If the pace of completions between 2023 and 2025 is kept up, Massachusetts would be on track to meet its goal of building 220,000 homes by 2035. But at the current pace of permitting, it’s unlikely the state will meet its construction goal.
Many of the homes recently completed were projects that were likely financed with “historically low” interest rates in the 2010s and 2020s, according to the report. Now, with more tariffs on building materials, workforce challenges and higher borrowing costs, getting projects financed is more difficult.
There are a lot of “intractable” challenges within government, but housing shouldn’t be one of them, said Lt. Gov. Kimberley Driscoll, during an event Wednesday where the report was unveiled.
”It should not be as hard as it is,” she said, adding that it’s important for local and state officials as well as housing developers and communities to work together.
Driscoll added the state’s goal of building 220,000 units by 2035 is reachable.
Homelessness hit record high levels in 2024 and dipped slightly in early 2025. However, the report noted that most recent available data was collected in January and may not reflect more recent shifts. Also, emergency assistance caseloads have dropped “dramatically” in 2025 – falling by almost half from January to July, according to the report, which said questions remain about whether those who exited shelters secured permanent housing or fell back into homelessness.
The report noted several moves by state leaders that contributed to this drop, including capping the shelter system to 4,000 families in July, a move which will take effect Dec. 31.  On Aug. 1, the governor also ended the state of emergency she declared in 2023 and closed all remaining hotel shelters.
The report also included a section with research by the Boston University Initiative on Cities on what communities have done to meet requirements outlined in the MBTA Communities Act. The section also includes a case study on how Lexington, Needham and Wellesley responded to the law.
The act requires 177 cities and towns in the MBTA service area to change their zoning and land use policies to allow for construction of more housing – without requiring more housing to get built. The law has received a lot of media attention over controversy surrounding communities working on creating compliant plans.
Each community has had its own approach to complying with the law, and each faced many options. In 2025, the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities has approved plans for 106 municipalities. Another 56 communities are in conditional or interim compliance – meaning their processes are in progress or submissions are under review. Also, 15 communities with deadlines in July 2025 were not compliant as of Sept. 5. and 27 communities have deadlines in December, according to the report.
Indeed, Driscoll said the law has been a “source of inspiration and at times a source of frustration.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Single-Family-Housing.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 14:57:32.642433

OSU President Jim Hess on Thursday announced the university’s latest major fundraising campaign, “The Code Calls.” The name is based on a set of principles known as the “Cowboy Code,” which begins with “We dream as big as the sky” and concludes with “We finish what we start.”
The OSU Foundation, the university’s fundraising arm, will accept donations through summer 2030, foundation President Blaire Atkinson said. Among the campaign’s top goals is making a donor-funded scholarship available to every OSU student.
The university enrolled 36,934 students across all of its campuses this semester, a record high for the OSU system. 
Hess unveiled the campaign during a pep rally on OSU’s flagship campus in Stillwater. 
“We want every single student who arrives here to have a scholarship opportunity — every single student,” he said during the rally. “We want every student to have a great academic adviser, a career readiness coach and a mentor who’s an alum, a donor or a member of our Cowboy family. Together we’ll help our students do the impossible because they do that routinely.”

OSU is launching The Code Calls Scholarship Fund in conjunction with the campaign, Hess said. He announced its first two awardees during the pep rally, a mechanical engineering student at OSU-Tulsa and a sophomore psychology major at the Stillwater campus. 
More than 81,000 donors already have contributed to The Code Calls campaign, Atkinson said.
“We would not be here had it not been for so many quiet-phase donors that locked arms with us over the last four years and got us to today,” she said during the Stillwater event.
OSU’s last billion-dollar fundraising effort lasted from 2007-2014 and similarly included an initial quiet phase. The “Branding Success” campaign, led by university President Burns Hargis, raised more than $1 billion, notably with $120 million in matching funds from megadonor T. Boone Pickens. 
Branding Success created thousands of student scholarships, 134 endowed faculty positions, and upgrades to athletic and academic facilities.

,DC,2025-11-13 19:04:32+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"As health costs spike, a sour and divided Congress escapes one shutdown to face another","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/health-costs-spike-sour-and-divided-congress-escapes-one-shutdown-face-another,,"WASHINGTON — Congress has roughly two months to find bipartisan agreement to curb rising health insurance costs if lawmakers want to avoid another government shutdown.That herculean task would be difficult in the best circumstances, but is much more challenging after lawmakers spent the last 43 days criticizing each other instead of building the types of trust that are usually needed for large deals. Democrats maintained they wanted to address skyrocketing premiums for individual health care plans, while Republicans insisted those talks had to occur when the government was open.At the same time, congressional leaders will try to wrap up work on the nine full-year government funding bills that were supposed to become law before Oct. 1 and weren’t included in the package that reopened the government. Congress must pass all of those bills or another stopgap measure before the new Jan. 30 deadline, regardless of how well or disastrous talks on a health care bill turn out. The two-track negotiations will push party leaders to compromise on issues they’d rather not, especially as next year’s November midterm elections inch closer. Early signs were not good.House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a Wednesday night press conference the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of the year are a “boondoggle” and that “Republicans would demand a lot of reforms” before agreeing to extend those in any way. “We currently have 433 members of the House of Representatives. There's a lot of opinions in this building. And on our side, certainly, a lot of opinions on how to fix health care and make it more affordable. I have to allow that process to play out,” Johnson, R-La., said. While Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., made a commitment to hold a vote on a health care bill before the end of December to conclude the shutdown, Johnson has avoided giving a timeline for when he would bring any similar legislation to the floor. President Donald Trump, aside from throwing insults at Democrats, largely stayed on the sidelines of the shutdown fight, though he suggested the funds used for the tax credits should in some way go directly to individuals instead of large insurance companies.Pessimism over progressThe shutdown highlighted the stark differences Republicans and Democrats hold on health care as prices for insurance continue to spike, forcing millions of Americans to choose between taking care of themselves and breaking their budgets, States Newsroom found in interviews with members of Congress. GOP leaders held together throughout the funding lapse and didn’t negotiate on the expiring ACA marketplace tax credits, or anything else. Now that it’s over, Republicans will need to put something forward.Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said her sense is that Congress will “probably be in the same place on January 30th that we are now.”“We have two parties here, two sides,” DeLauro said. “In the past … we've had serious negotiation back and forth, and that's what we need to do, and that's not happening.”While Republicans have unified control of government, major legislation needs the support of at least 60 senators to advance in that chamber. Republicans hold 53 seats at the moment, meaning at least some Democrats must support a bill for it to pass. DeLauro did not rule out another shutdown, saying Democrats plan to take the next few months “one day at a time,” while closely watching what Republicans are willing to do on the nine full-year appropriations bills and health care costs. Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, former House majority leader and a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said Republican leaders keeping that chamber in recess for nearly two months leading up to and during the shutdown significantly delayed work on the full-year government funding bills. Hoyer said that scheduling decision was a clear “indication they're not interested in solving the problem.”“If they were, they would have had members here working on appropriation bills,” Hoyer said. ""And the only way you're going to ultimately solve this problem is to pass appropriation bills.”Hoyer said the real question facing Congress now isn’t whether there is time to work out agreement on the remaining nine government spending bills, but whether there’s a will to make the types of compromises needed. Untangling spending billsThe spending package that reopened the government included three of the dozen full-year bills, funding the Agriculture Department, Food and Drug Administration, Legislative Branch, military construction projects and Department of Veterans Affairs.The remaining appropriations bills will be considerably tougher to resolve, especially because the House and Senate have yet to agree on how much they want to spend across the thousands of programs. Trump proposed major cutbacks in multiple programs in his budget request earlier this year that Democrats have strongly resisted.The Defense, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS-Education and State-Foreign Operations bills will be some of the more difficult to settle. Congress could always lean on another stopgap spending bill to keep funding relatively flat for the departments and agencies not covered by a full-year bill before Jan. 30. But lawmakers will need bipartisan support to advance in the Senate.Washington Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Republicans don’t seem to grasp how much Americans are struggling with the cost of living, including for health insurance and health care. “My constituents are already telling me that they're making that choice between having health insurance or having a house to live in, and they're going to choose the house,” Jayapal said. Whether or not a partial government shutdown begins in early 2026 will likely depend on whether Republican lawmakers from swing districts force bipartisanship on a health care bill. “I really don't know,” Jayapal said. “I think it depends on these vulnerable House Republicans, who are not going to be able to go back to their constituents without telling them that they've done something on health care.”Political juice and a backboneDemocratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said she wouldn’t be surprised if Congress is unable to strike a deal on government funding and winds up in a partial shutdown by February. “Do I think that the Republicans have the political juice to get … the rest of their appropriation bills across the finish line and a health care deal? No,” Stansbury said. She added that she hopes a handful of Republicans decide to join Democrats on the discharge petition bill that would force a floor vote on a bill to extend the ACA marketplace subsidies for three years. “We gotta find a few brave Republicans who still have a backbone and some guts to stand up to this administration and actually care for their constituents,” Stansbury said. But any bipartisan deal to extend those health care tax credits seems fraught, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries slammed Republicans as having “zero credibility on this issue.”He pointed to Republicans trying several times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including their last attempt in 2017, when GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and the late John McCain of Arizona crossed party lines to vote against repealing the 2010 law.“There's no evidence that they're serious about extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” Jeffries, of New York, said. “Republicans have zero interest in fixing the health care crisis that they've created.”‘No point in taking 41 days to cave’When Democrats controlled both chambers, temporary health care subsidies were originally passed as part of the COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan in 2021 for two years. With Democrats still controlling both chambers, lawmakers approved the Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 signature climate policy bill from the Biden administration, that extended those health care subsidies for three years, expiring at the end of December 2025.The outcome of the just concluded shutdown is shaping some House Democrats’ views.Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott said if there is a new shutdown come February, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether they’re going to “cave again, or at least engage in negotiations.” “When the (Senate) Democrats say: ‘Our strategy wasn’t working,’ it wasn’t working because they assume you’re going to cave, which you just proved,” Scott told States Newsroom. “Their strategy worked — trying to get them to negotiate and talk to you doesn't because they know you’re going to cave.”Scott said “there’s no point in taking 41 days to cave,” pointing to the eight members of the Senate Democratic Caucus who broke ranks to advance and later approve the package to reopen the government. “Why don’t you just cave right at the beginning, on February 2nd?” he said. “If the Republican strategy is: ‘We’re not going to negotiate at all because you’re going to cave,’ you have to show them that you’re not going to cave, then you can have a discussion.”Scott said the same health care issues will still exist if nothing happens between now and the package’s Jan. 30 government funding deadline.  “By then, we’ll know that several million people don’t have health insurance, we’ll know that rural hospitals are beginning to suffer,” Scott said. Delaware Democratic Rep. Sarah McBride said that “from today through November (2026) and after, we will continue to be talking about health care, to be fighting for health care.”“I think what you’ve seen over the last several months, you will continue to see from us through November and then, God willing, once we’re in a majority, we’ll do all that we can to reverse these cuts and restore care and expand access to it,” she said.",,,,2025-11-13 14:57:32.642433

It acts as an AI teaching assistant that manages assignments and student participation.,"A Mississippi-based artificial intelligence startup has raised over $1 million in new funding.
Starkville-based Campusknot was co-founded by Rahul Gopal, a graduate of Mississippi State University. Its growth and evolution illustrate the possibility and support that exists in Mississippi for startups.
“Campusknot is a perfect example of what happens when the in-state ecosystem works together over time,” said Lindsey Benefield, investment director at Innovate Mississippi. “They’ve had support at every stage — from Mississippi State University and the E-Center, to Innovate Mississippi, to individual angels — all reinforcing and building momentum around a strong Mississippi founder. The progress they’re making is well-earned.”
Katherine Lin
Gopal came from India to study aerospace engineering at Mississippi State University. The initial concept for Campusknot started while he was in college, with support from the Mississippi State Center for Entrepreneurship. Over the past 10 years, Campusknot has adapted to new technologies but the core idea of enhancing student engagement in the classroom has remained.

In its current form, the platform helps professors connect better with students. It acts as an AI teaching assistant that manages assignments and student participation. 
Campusknot has been supported by Innovate Mississippi and Idea Village in Louisiana. These regional startup incubators have been “instrumental” in the company’s development, according to Gopal.
Entergy Mississippi investing over $1B into grid infrastructure
One of the projects Entergy is investing in is a natural-gas power plant in Vicksburg. 
At a recent event, Entergy Vice President of Business and Economic Development Ed Gardner reiterated the company’s assertion that these projects will not place too much burden on consumers thanks to larger customers, such as the state’s burgeoning data centers. 
“Your bills will be 16% lower than they were going to be because of these large customers that we’re bringing in,” said Gardner.
Joint Legislative Budget Committee adopts revised revenue outlook
A panel of Mississippi lawmakers that leads the Legislature in setting a state budget last week adopted revised revenue estimates for the current fiscal year and the coming one.
For FY 2026, which ends in June, the lawmakers revised their final estimate of state revenue downward by about 1%, or $75 million, to $7.55 billion. For fiscal year 2027, which starts in July, lawmakers on the JLBC also used a cautious estimate, banking on revenue being down to $7.532 billion. 
State Economist Corey Miller gave lawmakers an update on tax revenue. He said corporate income tax collections are down slightly, sales tax revenue is up and individual income tax collections are up despite the state phasing out the tax.
The JLBC greeing on how much money the state has to work with is an initial step for setting a state budget. The full Legislature convenes in January and will set a budget for the coming fiscal year.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Arkansans should expect their full SNAP benefits for November to be disbursed to cards late Thursday and into Friday, according to the state’s human services department.
The announcement comes after President Donald Trump signed a bill into law Wednesday night that reopened the federal government following a 43-day shutdown, the longest in the country’s history. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which serves about 42 million people, has been the subject of legal battles in recent weeks as officials argued if and how much beneficiaries could be paid during the shutdown. 
Following revised guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Thursday, the Arkansas Department of Human Services has started internal processes to allow the distribution of SNAP funding “as soon as possible,” according to an agency press release. SNAP benefits, which are completely federally funded but administered by the states, are expected to be available beginning at midnight. 
“We are pleased that our beneficiaries will soon receive this important food assistance because we know that families all across our state depend on SNAP to supplement their grocery budgets,” DHS Secretary Janet Mann said in the release. “This has been difficult for our beneficiaries, and we are incredibly appreciative to our partners across the state who helped bridge the gap through food pantries, donation drives, and other assistance efforts.”
Sanders directs another $500K to Arkansas food banks as SNAP whipsaw drags on

Some of that assistance came from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who released a million dollars in state funds to the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance for sharing with six regional food banks.
More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to DHS. Arkansas has the highest prevalence of food insecurity in the nation, according to a 2024 USDA report.
More than 70 DHS employees were furloughed because of the shutdown, and funds administered to community partners through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) programs were suspended, according to the release. Transitional Employment Assistance (TEA)/Work Pays cash assistance programs for newly approved beneficiaries were also suspended.
About half of the furloughed DHS employees were within the Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance, and they returned to work on Thursday. Other employees remained on furlough and the affected programs were still paused Thursday pending confirmation from federal partners that funds were restored, according to the release.

(Photo by Getty Images)Kentucky lawmakers studying artificial intelligence have issued a slew of recommendations ahead of the next legislative session that include protections for minors exposed to AI online and state laws about the location of data centers.
The Kentucky Artificial Intelligence Task Force concluded on Thursday its second round of studying how AI is used in Kentucky and other states. The task force also met last year during the legislative interim; several of its recommendations became law during the 2025 legislative session sponsored by co-chair Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington.
A memo with the latest findings was sent to Republicans Senate President Robert Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne as well as members of the Legislative Research Commission after the meeting. 
Rep. Josh Bray, a Mount Vernon Republican who is the second co-chair of the task force, said that some of the recommendations are better suited to be addressed at the federal level, so the group is encouraging Kentucky’s congressional representatives to consider them. 
Democratic Caucus Chair Sen. Reggie Thomas, of Lexington, said that he supports most of the recommendations, particularly one that encourages lawmakers to acknowledge how AI can be harmful to children and consider policies to protect minors on social media platforms. However, he said he would “approve with some caution” recommendations regarding data centers. One recommendation said lawmakers should consider laws regarding the location of data centers and requirements they should meet. Another calls for considering policies pertaining to data centers’ need for “large amounts of water and power” and “more baseload power to ensure grid sufficiency.” That recommendation calls for consulting with the Public Service Commission. 
Thomas added that while he is “for data centers” they should not be built without an environmental impact survey and considering an increased cost in power for local consumers because of data centers’ high demand for electricity. 
“I think if there’s an increased cost that comes with data center construction or use, then that data center should pay for that increased cost, not the current consumers or the current business users who were using it before the data center came online,” Thomas said. 
Bray said Thomas’ “concerns are the exact reason those sections were drafted.” Lawmakers want to make sure that consumers’ electric bills do not increase as a result of a data center, Bray continued. 
Kentucky could have a “boom” of data center projects on the horizon, as some supporters see them as an opportunity to bring more jobs and money to the state. However, some communities have opposed them because of their size and intrusiveness and due to higher costs for water and electricity as demand increases. 
The task force approved 10 recommendations, which are: 

Consider legislative changes to the Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Act to strengthen consumer protections as data collection processes change with the evolution of AI technology.
Consider changes to the AI acceptable use policy for all state agencies.
Consider legislative policies to promote collaboration among service providers, state agencies and state research universities for the shared use and study of Medicaid data sets for how Kentucky families can prevent certain diseases resulting in lowering health care costs to Medicaid. 
Acknowledge that AI technology may be harmful to minors and consider legislative policies for the protection of minors on social media platforms.
Acknowledge that AI may impact careers regulated by professional standards, and consider legislative policies in coordination with professional standards boards to discuss when and how AI should be used within their profession.
Create or facilitate the creation of an AI work group to serve as a collaborative platform to bring together state and local governments, educational institutions, healthcare providers, industry, and citizens to identify needs, collect data, develop artificial intelligence solutions, foster innovation and competitiveness, promote artificial intelligence literacy, and ensure trusted artificial intelligence development and governance for Kentucky.
Incorporate AI development and governance into existing standing committees’ jurisdiction.
Consider legislative policies for the location of data centers in Kentucky including minimum requirements for location and collaboration among local, state, and private entities. 
Consider legislative policies for data centers’ need for large amounts of water and power requiring more baseload power to ensure grid sufficiency, including consultation with the Public Service Commission. 
Encourage Kentucky’s federal delegation to work on national policies for AI as it impacts individual Kentuckians:

name, image, and likeness property rights;
consumer protection;
data protection from retail companies and data-driven pricing; and
small business economic issues from a patchwork of state laws.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)In a decisive rebuke of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an immigration judge on Wednesday ordered the agency to release a young immigrant held at a Virginia detention center — one day after the same court ordered the release of two brothers at the center of a class-action challenge to ICE’s treatment of Special Immigrant Juvenile Status applicants.
The two brothers, both in their late teens, were ordered released on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the court granted release to a third young immigrant in the same age group who, like the brothers, entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and later applied for SIJS, a pathway toward permanent legal protection. All three had been detained since August. 
“These young brothers came to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and cannot safely return to their home countries after it was determined that they were abused, abandoned, or neglected,” said ACLU of Virginia Legal Director Eden Heilman in a statement. 
“Federal law says they have every legal right to be in the United States, and that ICE should never have put them in a detention center. Now they will finally be freed from detention and reunited with each other.”
ICE has not commented publicly on the Virginia rulings, and agency representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
 A legal pathway ignored

Congress almost four decades ago created SIJS to give vulnerable children a path toward lawful permanent residency. The process requires a state court to determine that the child cannot safely return to their country of origin, followed by a visa application and, eventually, an adjustment to citizenship. 
Those granted or applying for SIJS are not typically subject to mandatory detention.
Yet, the class-action complaint, filed in October by the ACLU of Virginia and partner counsel in the Alexandria Division of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, contends that ICE, under current policies, is treating SIJS-eligible youth as “arriving noncitizens” who must be detained without bond — despite protections under anti-trafficking laws, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the U.S. Constitution.
“Our clients are following the rules they’ve been given to obtain citizenship. The federal judge’s ruling confirmed that ICE is not,” said ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney Sophia Gregg. “By ignoring the legal process Congress established decades ago, ICE is causing the very chaos and confusion that the Trump administration claims it’s working to fix.”
The federal judge’s order requires ICE to provide bond hearings to the named plaintiffs and bars the government from denying bond or invoking automatic stays if bond is granted.
The immigration court’s Tuesday order released the two brothers, both of whom arrived in the U.S. as minors and have SIJS applications or approvals. They were being held at the Caroline Detention Facility and the Farmville Detention Facility, both of which typically house adults.
On Wednesday, the court ordered a third plaintiff released — another client of the ACLU-VA who also entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and is eligible for SIJS protections. That ruling marked at least the second time this week the court rejected ICE’s argument that SIJS-eligible youth may be detained without bond.
 A broader trend

Virginia’s case reflects a nationwide surge of litigation over ICE’s increasingly aggressive detention of immigrants — including youth with protected statuses — without access to bond hearings. For example, in Massachusetts, a federal judge recently certified a class action challenging denials of bond hearings to immigrants held without inspection.
In New Bedford, Mass., a judge last month ordered the release of an 18-year-old SIJS recipient held in a county facility despite his protected status.

A July 2025 memo from ICE declared that undocumented immigrants who entered without inspection could be detained throughout their removal proceedings — often months or years — without access to bond hearings.
“These cases show the growing force of legal challenges to ICE’s detention practices,” the Amica Center wrote after a separate court ruling this fall. 
 What’s at stake 

Over the summer, immigration‐enforcement tactics in Virginia spurred widespread public protest. 
Dozens gathered outside rallies organized by the Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice and Equality, calling for an end to local cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement following a wave of “masked, unmarked” detentions in the region.
In June and July, activists confronted courthouse raids in Chesterfield County and other sites, decrying what they described as “abduction-style” arrests of immigrants — many without criminal records. These protests underscored mounting local resistance as Virginia communities grapple with the human impact of enforcement policies.
For the three young immigrants now ordered released, the rulings mean freedom from detention and the chance to continue the SIJS process outside a jail setting. 
But the broader class-action lawsuit remains in early stages, and thousands of other SIJS-eligible youth nationwide remain subject to detention policies advocates say misinterpret federal law.
Advocates warn that prolonged detention can inflict long-term psychological harm on young people who have already survived trauma.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Some Republicans in New Hampshire want the state’s Medicaid work requirements to go further than the requirements being implemented nationwide.
In an effort led by Rep. Jim Kofalt, of Wilton, Republicans want to ban self-attestation as an option for determining eligibility under the new work requirements, which means Medicaid enrollees would need to provide quarterly documentary proof of employment rather than attesting to their work status.
Medicaid is the nation’s public health care program, run jointly by the state and federal governments, for people with low income and unique needs. Congress mandated work requirements for the program when it passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, President Donald Trump’s signature legislative priority in his second term, in July. Under the new law, Medicaid enrollees must work 80 hours per month in order to receive coverage.
Meanwhile, state-level Republicans also passed Medicaid work requirements as part of the new state budget.
Kofalt proposed an amendment to the new state law that would not only ban self-attestation but require Medicaid enrollees to work three continuous months before they can receive coverage. However, New Hampshire Medicaid Director Henry Lipman and other Medicaid officials said during a House Health and Human Services Committee meeting Wednesday that Kofalt had agreed to rework the amendment without that three-month look-back.
The work requirements will apply only to Medicaid enrollees in the Granite Advantage program, also known as Medicaid expansion, which covers the highest income groups eligible for Medicaid. The work requirements provide exceptions for “medical frailty” and “special needs” as “medically certified by a statement” from a medical professional.
Lawmakers will seek to avoid mistakes the state made last time it tried to implement Medicaid work requirements. In 2018, the state mandated that Medicaid enrollees work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. About one month after the effective date of the rule, the state reversed course and then-Gov. Chris Sununu paused the requirements. Only 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement had complied and documented their hours. The rest were set to lose coverage before Sununu intervened. Leading up to the reversal, the state had spent over $130,000 in outreach efforts to teach people what the requirements were and how to complete the paperwork to prove they were working.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/lipmanmedicaid-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 13:57:44.197726

“I can’t in good conscience vote for something that further damages an already broken health care system,” Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., said in a statement.

The three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation all voted against a deal that ended the federal government shutdown because it did not include most Democrats’ key demand throughout the impasse: an extension of health insurance tax credits. 
President Donald Trump signed the measure into law late Wednesday, just hours after the House passed it, 222-209. Six House Democrats joined most Republicans to pass the proposal; Vermont’s U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., was not among those who crossed party lines.
“I’m a hell no,” Balint said in a statement following the vote. “I can’t in good conscience vote for something that further damages an already broken health care system.”
The spending package will keep the federal government’s lights on through the end of January 2026. It will fund the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, military construction projects and Congressional operations through September 2026.
The deal also provides full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as SNAP’s program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, through September 2026.
“From the beginning Trump has used the shutdown as a political game — from withholding food from children to harassing air traffic controllers who take on second jobs to make ends meet,” Balint said. “This bill is just another way to ram through his corrupt agenda.” 
A breakthrough in the shutdown, which had reached its 43rd day on Wednesday, first emerged in the Senate. Last weekend, eight members of that chamber’s Democratic caucus came to a deal with GOP leaders to support a temporary funding package with an understanding that the Senate would hold a vote on extending the health insurance credits next month.
But it’s far from clear that such a vote will be successful in the Senate, and even less likely the measure would be taken up in the House or signed by Trump.
Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch both voted against the deal when it was up for approval in the Senate on Monday. They’ve both said they have little confidence that a vote on extending the subsidies — a Covid-19-era expansion of tax credits that are part of the Affordable Care Act — would be successful.
The subsidies help millions of low- and middle-income people across the country afford the cost of their health insurance premiums. In Vermont, the credits apply to plans available through the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, called Vermont Health Connect. 
Without them, tens of thousands of people in Vermont would see their health care costs skyrocket, and many would likely no longer be able to afford coverage. Barring new congressional action, the enhanced credits are set to expire at the end of 2025.

“I cannot vote for a government funding bill that kicks millions of Americans off their health care,” Welch said in a statement after Monday’s Senate vote. 
“There was an early recognition from my Republican colleagues that working families, small businesses, and farmers in their states would be really hurt by these premium increases — just as they will be in Democratic states, too,” he added. “That’s why it is so disappointing that Republicans refused to come to the table to extend the Affordable Care Act’s premium tax credits.”

McGuire, who terms out of the Legislature next year, hopes to capitalize on Democrats’ new voter registration advantage in LaMalfa’s post-Prop. 50 district to flip a congressional seat from red to blue. His launch video appears to preemptively address the criticism that he’s out of touch with rural Californians. 


California Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire has officially launched his challenge to longtime Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa in a congressional district drastically redrawn by Proposition 50. 
The Santa Rosa Democrat, who will hit his 12-year term limit in the Legislature next year, was widely viewed once the new maps were drawn as a prospective challenger to LaMalfa, a rice farmer from Oroville who has represented the North State in Congress since 2013. 
LaMalfa’s current district stretches from Siskiyou County and much of the Oregon-California border down through rural Shasta and Sutter Counties. Under the new voter-approved Prop. 50 maps, the district shifts south out of Modoc County and jogs westward to pick up parts of Sonoma County and McGuire’s home base of Santa Rosa. 
McGuire will face heavy skepticism from some northern rural residents in the 1st Congressional District, who just a few years ago tried to secede from liberal California to form the conservative “state of Jefferson” with rural parts of southern Oregon. 
In an apparent effort to head off inevitable accusations of being out of touch with rural life, McGuire spent much of his launch video doubling down on promises to prioritize farmers’ needs and “make sure rural communities get their fair share.” 
“I know these roads. I know these towns,” McGuire says as he strolls down a tree-lined country road, a white pickup truck clearly visible in the background. “This district is big, it’s rural, and now more than ever, it needs a fighter.”
After devastating wildfires that wiped out thousands of homes and killed dozens in Sonoma and Napa counties in 2017, McGuire made wildfire prevention his signature issue in the Legislature. Following the Palisades and Eaton fires in January, McGuire ushered through an ambitious 13-bill package that expanded insurance coverage and sped up rebuilding of damaged homes after destructive fires. 
His critics have said McGuire’s singular focus on wildfire issues sometimes clouded his ability to balance and prioritize other policy areas, especially once he ascended to the role of pro tem last February, succeeding the well-regarded former Sen. Toni Atkins and becoming the chief traffic cop for which bills could come to the Senate floor.
McGuire also developed a reputation for holding out on negotiations until he could extract a win for his policy priorities or his constituents: He was the top recipient of budget “earmarks” for local projects back home, funds that he will surely tout as major wins during his campaign. 
During last-minute negotiations on a multi-pronged climate and energy policy deal earlier this fall, Gov. Gavin Newsom had to make an eleventh hour visit to the Capitol to push McGuire and his team onto the same page as him and Assembly leadership. 
McGuire promised in his launch video to deliver “no drama, no BS, no gimmicks” if elected to Congress. And while he mostly shied away from the argument that he would flip a seat from Republican to Democratic control, he did acknowledge that he would push back on the Trump administration. 
“Don’t worry, I will always stand up to the destructive policies of Donald Trump,” he said in the video. “I’m all in — every damn day.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 13:57:44.197726

Oct. 22. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina extended the deadline by which a homeless encampment in north Lansing must be cleared by 90 days. The initial deadline had been Friday, and Aquilina noted that there are still 40 to 50 people living on the site. 
“I will shorten it if you clean all this up,” she told the city’s lawyers, referring to the time frame given to clear the area. “Once people are leaving, once you help them, once you house them, as I said last time, you may bulldoze and start cleaning it, making it safe, because I don’t want new people there.”
Aquilina hosts weekly hearings in her courtroom in a civil suit brought by the city of Lansing against JAJ Property LLC, the property owners of a site that has become a large homeless encampment that the city is seeking to clear. Throughout those hearings, Aquilina has repeatedly noted that she wants to ensure that the people currently living in the encampment are given the proper support they need to find a safe place to go. 
“These are human beings, not garbage, and they will not, on my watch, be treated like garbage,” she said in the hearing on Wednesday.
“What about the winter? We’re going to have deaths. We need to have these people in a safe place. We need to move them somewhere,” Aquilina added. “They are unlawfully there. I want by no means anyone to think that I think this is lawful.”
She expressed concerns that the population of the camp might actually be growing, though city lawyers said that the growing number reflected more people being willing to work with city social workers, not new people moving onto the property.  
Aquilina also urged the city’s lawyers to seek assistance from local and state government officials outside of herself — city council members, state legislators and even Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. 
“We have a governor, she listens. We have a Legislature, they don’t always listen,” Aquilina said. “How about the mayor? How about showing up to city council? How about we get more than me?”
The city’s legal team told Aquilina that they are doing everything they can to resolve the issue and are “devoting a significant amount of time and resources to coming up with a solution to this issue.”

New Dashboard shows modest gains,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/11/california-k-12-students/,"Test scores improved, but absenteeism and English learner progress stalled in the latest Dashboard.","In summary
Test scores improved, but absenteeism and English learner progress stalled in the latest Dashboard.


California’s K-12 students showed moderate progress academically last year, with some bright spots but otherwise plateauing after years of post-pandemic improvements, according to the new California School Dashboard released today.
Chronic absenteeism, discipline rates and progress among English learners all remained mostly unchanged, with slight improvements. Academic performance improved, but still lagged behind pre-pandemic levels.
The Dashboard is a user-friendly, color-coded guide for the public to understand schools’ performance. Schools get credit for their students’ scores, but also for how much progress they’ve made — a metric that some have said can be misleading. The Dashboard assigns colors to reflect schools’ performance, with blue being the best and red triggering interventions from the state. Last year was the first year all categories earned a yellow or green, indicating improvement.
“Seeing modest improvements on every Dashboard indicator should encourage us to deepen our investments in every child’s progress,” State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said. “We must not rest until all students’ outcomes represent their brilliance and potential.”
College and career readiness a bright spot
A highlight was college and career readiness, with a record-high number of students graduating last year prepared for college and the job market.
Nearly 52% of last year’s crop of graduating seniors satisfied the requirements to attend a public university in California or completed a 2-to-4-year career pathway. The number was up 3.1% over the previous year, bringing the overall total to its highest level since the state introduced the Dashboard almost a decade ago.
California has been promoting career pathways in high schools for years, providing money and guidance for schools to train students in health care, engineering, environmental science, agriculture and other careers. Typically, students take a sequence of career-themed courses linked to their academic work, often combined with out-of-school internships or classes at local community colleges.
Last year, nearly 27% of students completed a career pathway, up about 1 percentage point from the previous year.
College readiness also improved, but that was partly because the state now includes completion of Advanced Placement courses among its measurements. Last year, 55% of students took at least one AP class.
Record-high graduation rate
The graduation rate also hit its highest level — 88% — since the Dashboard was introduced in 2017, when the rate was about 83%. 

“Today’s Dashboard results show California continuing to make important strides in post-pandemic recovery — we’re getting more students reengaged in the classroom, graduating students in greater numbers, and getting more of them prepared for college and careers,” California State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond said in a statement. 
Slight improvement in absenteeism 
But other Dashboard measurements were lackluster. Chronic absenteeism, for example, which soared to 30% during the pandemic, fell only 1 percentage point last year. After several years of steep declines, the rate all but stalled at just over 19%. Before the pandemic, about 11% of students were chronically absent, which means they missed 10% or more of the school year.
The Los Angeles wildfires and a surge in immigration raids are among the reasons for the stalled progress in attendance, said Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a research and policy organization. Thousands of students missed school due to the fires, while others stayed away due to fears of deportation.
“I’m not surprised,” Chang said. “It’s a sign that we need a statewide game plan to address attendance. I also think this will require perseverance over time.”
Schools that prioritized personal relationships with families tended to have better attendance, she said. Attendance also improved at schools that identified individual students who needed assistance getting to school every day and then provided that assistance.
English learner progress was also stagnant, with only 46.4% of students making progress toward English language proficiency. The number increased less than 1% from last year.
Big improvements in Dinuba
Dinuba Unified, a rural district southeast of Fresno, was among the state’s bright spots. The 6,000-student district, where a third of students are English learners and more than 85% are low-income, saw across-the-board improvements last year. English language arts test scores soared more than 10 percentage points, math scores jumped nearly 6 percentage points, and the graduation rate topped 95%.
District administrators attributed the success to low staff turnover and grant funding that allows teachers ample time to prepare lesson plans, collaborate and understand new curriculum, particularly in math. The newly rebuilt high school also has popular career pathways, including construction management and transportation, which entice students to stay in school and graduate, said Lisa Benslay, the district’s director of intervention.
“Our mission is to end generational poverty through education,” Benslay said. “People have really bought into that. They see the need, and feel a moral conviction.”
Funding expires
Statewide, students’ performance tanked during the pandemic, when most schools closed for in-person learning, but rebounded significantly the past few years. The state and federal government poured billions into programs to help students recover, such as tutoring, after-school and summer programs, mental health counseling and enticements meant to boost attendance. 
But that money largely expired last year, and schools have had to cut many of those programs. Some are also getting less money from the state due to declining enrollment.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/032023-T.-Griffin-Stege-Elementary-SK-CM-16.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 13:57:44.197726

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Kirsten Baesler officially resigned Thursday as the federal government reopened, paving the way for her to begin a new job with the U.S. Department of Education.
Baesler’s position leading the state’s public K-12 education system will end Nov. 24, according to a letter of resignation she submitted to Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
Baesler will become the assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education at the Department of Education after being confirmed by the Senate in October. Her first day was delayed by the federal government shutdown. She has served as the state superintendent since 2013.
“I’m deeply proud of the team we built and the culture we created,” Baesler said in a news release. “We shifted from being a regulatory agency to a customer-service organization that puts students and their families at the center.”
Armstrong appointed Levi Bachmeier, business manager for the West Fargo School District and former policy adviser to Gov. Doug Burgum, as the next superintendent of public instruction. Bachmeier is expected to assume his new duties after Baesler leaves the role.

Baesler highlighted the department’s work ensuring North Dakota students graduate high school “choice ready” for college, a career or military service. Graduates prepared for those three options increased during her tenure, according to the department.
With assistance of state lawmakers, Baesler created an innovation waiver program for schools during her time as superintendent, which empowered local districts to design new teaching and learning models around student mastery of specific subjects of interest.
She also emphasized leveraging student senior years through dual-credit college courses and workforce preparation programs.
“While I am excited to begin this next chapter of service at the U.S. Department of Education, I do so carrying the lessons, values, and steadfast spirit of North Dakota with me,” Baesler wrote in her resignation letter. “I remain committed to ensuring a seamless handoff to my successor and stand ready to assist in any way that helps maintain continuity for the important work underway.”

(Courtesy NMDOH)The New Mexico Department of Health on Thursday issued an alert over ByHeart whole nutrition infant formula, telling the public to stop using it immediately.
ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula’s manufacturers are removing their product from store shelves in New Mexico and nationwide after it was linked to 15 cases of infant botulism in 12 states. Currently, New Mexico does not have any confirmed cases, a DOH news release said.
According to the Centers for Disease and Prevention, infant botulism occurs when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum spores that grow in the gut and make toxin.
Signs of botulism in infants can take a few weeks to develop, health officials said, and include: constipation; poor feeding; drooping eyelids and sluggish pupils; weak sucking; weak or altered crying; lethargy; a “floppy” appearance; and difficulty breathing
Once symptoms start, however, botulism “can quickly become a medical emergency,” Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said in a statement. “Any infant with signs of botulism should be evaluated by a medical professional immediately.”
Untreated, botulism’s symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and torso and subsequent death.
NMDOH says anyone whose infant has botulism should seek immediate attention; those with non-urgent questions can call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773).
According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, all ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula products have been recalled, including all unexpired lots of formula cans and single-serve “anywhere” sticks.  The FDA recommends anyone with ByHeart products should take a photo or record information about the package; keep it somewhere safe and label it not for use as the information might be requested in a child becomes sick; otherwise, throw containers out after 30 days.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/byheart.jpg,,,2025-11-13 12:58:06.695955

Stitt said he commuted Wood’s sentence to life without the possibility of parole.
“This action reflects the same punishment his brother received for their murder of an innocent young man and ensures a severe punishment that keeps a violent offender off the streets forever,” Stitt said. 
Wood was sentenced to die for the 2002 stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, 19, during a robbery at an Oklahoma City motel. 
Wipf was a migrant farm worker from  Montana. Wipf’s friend Arnold Kleinsasser was also a target, but escaped.
The Pardon and Parole Board last week voted 3-2 to recommend clemency to Stitt. 
Wood’s attorneys said his brother Zjaiton “Jake” Wood, admitted to the killing. 
Jake Wood received life without parole for his role and died in prison in 2019.
Wood’s attorneys said his trial lawyer, who died in 2018, was ineffective.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office said Wood was the killer and continued his criminal and gang behavior while behind bars.
Wood made a personal appearance by video and took responsibility for his role, but said he was not a killer.
“I pray for the family of Ronnie Wipf and for the surviving victim, Arnie,” Stitt said. “They are models of Christian forgiveness and love.”
Drummond said he was disappointed Stitt granted clemency for a dangerous murderer, but respected that it was Stitt’s decision to make.
“We are profoundly grateful for the moral courage and leadership Governor Stitt has shown in granting mercy to Tremane,” said Amanda Bass Castro-Alves, an attorney for Wood. “This decision honors the wishes of Mr. Wipf’s family and the surviving victim, and we hope it allows them a measure of peace.”
Stitt last granted clemency in 2021 to Oklahoma County killer Julius Jones. He has denied clemency recommendations in four other cases.

“It’s not fair,” said Meredith Farrow, owner of hemp business Clean Remedies in Avon.
As the federal government shutdown came to an end, hemp sellers like Farrow were surprised by the Senate. When voting to open the government, policymakers closed a loophole created in the 2018 Farm Bill, which allowed for low-level THC products to be sold without regulation.
Congress pushes hemp crackdown after pressure from states, marijuana industry

Congress’s Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill) allowed for hemp products to be sold as long as they have .3% THC or less.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued guidance on their website that under the law, the Drug Enforcement Administration no longer has the authority to seize and criminalize sending or buying seeds with less than .3% THC.
In 2019, Ohio legalized the product, as well.
“It would put all my employees out of business and me out of business — and our hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, thousands and thousands of customers that rely on this daily, they would be in a lurch,” Farrow said.
Just last month, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a temporary ban on hemp that gets users high. The products can look like candy, and they’re sold at places like gas stations and smoke shops with no age limits.
But a judge temporarily blocked DeWine’s executive order.
“If I kind of knew, I could make a decision and pivot,” Farrow said. “But being in limbo is the worst place to be,”
State Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, has been leading the charge to protect hemp products, and he said Congress threw a wrench in his plans.
“We’re still trying to figure out how to implement what’s going on at the federal level, so I think that maybe pumped the brakes a little bit — while we try to figure out how to proceed based on that,” Fischer said.
But marijuana industry legal expert Jonathan Adler explained that the federal policy doesn’t have to impact Ohio sellers.
Hemp policy will likely be dealt with on a state level, like marijuana, he said.
“While marijuana is illegal for purposes of federal law, the federal government doesn’t have the resources, doesn’t have the personnel to go after individual retailers, individual buyers, let alone individual users,” Adler said.
Adrienne Robbins with the Ohio Cannabis Coalition supports legal marijuana, but is anti-hemp.
She said that the ban should be enforced in Ohio.
“We think this is an issue of public health for both adults and children, to be clear, when it comes to these unregulated products,” Robbins said.
But if we aren’t enforcing federal law with marijuana, we asked Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, if the state should be enforcing it with hemp
“It’s a good question, in fact, a couple of people asked that today,” Huffman responded. “Well, we can do whatever we want regarding hemp… Now, are we going to go around and start cuffing 17-year-old clerks at gas stations? No, but we’ve got to get this thing in shape.”
Huffman has never been a fan of the product or of cannabis, but he said he has lost this fight — and it needs to be regulated in some way.
“I think that THC products should be sold the same way like we do with all alcohol products now… I think [a federal ban] changes the discussion that we’re having now, because with the federal action, there’s no legal way that these folks can operate where they are right now.”
Still, he acknowledged that THC drinks are very popular and likely will continue to be allowed regardless.

Until recently, the site was a state prison.","In summary
Immigrants in California’s newest ICE detention center allege they’re experiencing inhumane conditions and that they’re not getting access to lawyers. Until recently, the site was a state prison.


Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers. 
The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves. 
The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic. 
“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges. 
ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there. 
A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.
In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them. 
CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”
The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMattersthe federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law. 
“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges. 
The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm  Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP. 
Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections. 
Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list. 
One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice. 
“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092225_CalCity-Detention_MV_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 11:58:34.576359
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-13 16:50:53+00:00,CT Mirror,Fairfield County providers team up to add talk therapy to pediatric practices,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/13/fairfield-county-pediatrics-offices-psychotherapy-partnership/,A mental health provider is embedding therapists at Pediatric Healthcare Associates' offices to make behavioral health care easier to access.,"A major Connecticut pediatric practice is partnering with a nonprofit mental health provider to bring talk therapists directly into doctors’ offices — an effort to make behavioral health care easier to access amid rising demand for services and a shortage of providers.
With four locations in Fairfield County, Pediatric Healthcare Associates, or PHA, is one of the largest pediatric providers in the state, caring for roughly 34,000 children and young adults. For years, the group has been trying to streamline access to mental health services for its patients, many of whom struggle to find providers who are in-network and accepting clients, CEO Andrea Hagani said. 
“Taking care of their mental health is really important. Just as important as their physical health. Sometimes more,” Hagani said. “We’ve been looking to embed our own mental health services in the practice for years and years and years.”
Last year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that the country’s children were experiencing a mental health crisis. In Connecticut, nearly 1 in 2 teens will experience a mental health condition during their lifetime, according to a report from Fairfield County’s Community Foundation.
But accessing care can be difficult. In Connecticut, roughly 40% of people live in areas with mental health workforce shortages, according to a report from the state’s Office of Health Strategy. Those shortages tend to be more acute for people covered under Medicaid, which is typically accepted by fewer providers.
PHA had tried hiring mental health providers directly, and also looked into partnering with hospitals to bring in specialists, but they had failed to find an arrangement that stuck.
Then, during a chance conversation at an event in June, Hagani was describing the challenge to Edith Boyle, CEO of LifeBridge Community Services, a Bridgeport nonprofit behavioral health organization.
Boyle suggested placing LifeBridge therapists in PHA’s offices. And thus, the partnership was born.
Within four months — thanks to some efficient work from the operational teams at both organizations — one LifeBridge therapist was stationed in PHA’s Stratford office. Today, there are two. 
The plan is to expand the program next to PHA’s Fairfield location and then, eventually, to its offices in Trumbull and Shelton. 
The arrangement allows PHA patients to avoid the cumbersome process of finding a therapist that both has availability and accepts their insurance. Plus, Hagani said, when PHA patients see a LifeBridge therapist, they know they’re meeting with a provider their pediatrician trusts. 
Boyle, LifeBridge’s CEO, said the partnership is also about meeting families where they are, which allows them to address mental health issues before they escalate.
“By embedding behavioral health clinicians within pediatric practices, we meet families in a place of trust and familiarity. It’s about integration, prevention and early intervention, addressing concerns before they become a crisis,” Boyle said during a launch event for the partnership last month. 
In the pilot’s first 30 days, LifeBridge received 70 referrals from PHA pediatricians. As of the end of October, therapists were already providing care to more than 20 kids, Boyle said.
The partnership makes a lot of sense for LifeBridge, as well. Typically, patients at outpatient behavioral health programs miss roughly a third of their appointments. But not a single PHA referral has missed an appointment with a LifeBridge clinician so far.
“My patients are thrilled,” Hagani said, particularly when they find out that LifeBridge accepts most forms of insurance, including Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut. Roughly a third of PHA patients and 77% of LifeBridge patients are covered through HUSKY. 
Howard Sovronsky, the state’s inaugural Behavioral Health Advocate, said Connecticut should be proud to have one of the most robust systems of mental health care in the country. Still, he noted, access issues persist. 
Partnerships like the one between PHA and LifeBridge are a step in the right direction towards more integrated care, Sovronsky said during a press conference last month.
Pediatricians are often the first resource families tap when their children face a mental health issue, but they not often equipped to provide the full range of behavioral support patients may need, he added.
“It’s my hope and belief that this effort will serve as a model to encourage and inspire others to pursue these forms of collaborative care,” Sovronsky said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BRIDGEPORT-MENTAL-HEALTH-1024-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 11:58:34.576359

Reporters Jenna Carlesso, Dave Altimari, Katy Golvala and Andrew Brown were awarded for “Priced Out,” an investigation into the rate hikes that have affected nearly 100,000 long-term care insurance policy holders in Connecticut. Judges said the piece was “incredibly well done” and noted that it covered an issue with national relevance, saying “everyone in the country is going to have this problem.”
[Read the story here: CT long-term care insurance costs are skyrocketing, strangling consumers]
CT Mirror’s story explored the costs of maintaining long-term care insurance policies, which are skyrocketing due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Policyholders’ rate increases have often exceeded 50% and, for a few dozen people, got as high as 174%, CT Mirror found.
Following the reporting, Connecticut lawmakers raised at least 16 proposals during the 2025 legislative session to reform long-term care insurance. One bill, which would have boosted transparency by requiring insurers to hold public hearings whenever they raise rates by more than 10%, passed the Senate unanimously but died in the House.
“This series reflects what The Connecticut Mirror does best — deep, persistent reporting that holds power to account and centers the voices of those most affected,” CT Mirror Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton said. “We’re proud of our team’s commitment to uncovering the truth about an industry that has long operated in the shadows, and we’re honored to see that work recognized.”
This is the second time CT Mirror has won in the small/regional outlet category since the award’s inception in 2023. That year, Altimari and Carlesso won for “Connecticut’s Elder Care Reckoning,” a four-part series examining Connecticut’s destabilized nursing home sector and a home care system that operates with little to no oversight.
This year’s large outlet category award was given to Nathan O’Neal and Casey Hooker of FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul, who also covered long-term care insurance. They investigated Minnesota insurance companies CNA and Transamerica, finding that the former had increased its premiums by nearly 350% and the latter had a pattern of “delay and deny” in its claims process.

Víctor Ávila aún recuerda los gritos de sus vecinos, y ladridos de sus perros que lo despertaron una mañana a finales de octubre, al ver el humo saliendo de su calentador.
En cuestión de segundos, agarró a sus dos perros bajo el brazo, las llaves de su coche, se puso unas botas y bajó corriendo las escaleras, sin saber que estaba a punto de perder el lugar que llamó hogar durante más de 25 años.
El incendio en el sótano del edificio 271 en la avenida Wethersfield, provocó la evacuación de 17 adultos y siete niños, según la Cruz Roja Americana. Este fue el tercer incendio en octubre que dejó a inquilinos sin hogar y varias viviendas afectadas alrededor de Hartford.
“Llevamos tres años luchando para que se hagan responsables de solucionar todos los problemas y presten más atención a estos apartamentos, no es justo”, dijo Ávila, que trabaja instalando pisos.

El día del incendio, Ávila había regresado de un turno de noche, como la mayoría de los inquilinos del edificio en la zona de Barry Square, que tienen largas jornadas laborales o más de un empleo.
El desastre no fue un caso aislado en Hartford, donde se han producido 83 incendios de viviendas entre enero y octubre de este año, según Mario Oquendo Jr., jefe de distrito del Departamento de Bomberos de Hartford.
Justo al lado del edificio de Wethersfield hay una casa en ruinas por un incendio que ocurrió en enero, y a la vuelta de la esquina, otra casa quemada por un incendio en el verano, donde murieron cuatro personas.
En los días posteriores al incendio de octubre, los inquilinos del 271 no pudieron regresar a sus apartamentos de inmediato y reclamar sus pertenencias, que tuvieron que dejar atrás al evacuar.
Ávila esperaba que sus fotos y cassettes de videos, de los cuales algunos trajo consigo desde Aguascalientes, México, al mudarse a Estados Unidos, siguieran allí y no fueran robadas si alguien entraba a la fuerza en el edificio incendiado y cerrado.

Solicitudes de servicio
Los inquilinos de los edificios multifamiliares 267 y 271 de la avenida Wethersfield, junto con Teresa Quintana, activista de equidad de vivienda por la organización Make the Road, se han organizado para luchar por mejores condiciones de vivienda en los últimos tres años.
“Todos los martes nos reuníamos en uno de esos garajes de atrás y empezábamos la reunión, hablando y diciendo: ‘Esto está pasando’ y ‘Queremos que esto cambie’”, recuerda Quintana.
“Luego enviaban cartas al propietario y se quejaban como grupo ante el ayuntamiento una y otra vez”.
Quintana asegura que cuando inicialmente organizó a los inquilinos para que enviaran quejas a la ciudad sobre cucarachas, ratas y goteras en el techo, los formularios estaban en inglés y la mayoría de los inquilinos sólo hablaba español. “Antes no había quejas porque el formulario ni siquiera estaba en español. Si no hay accesibilidad lingüística, obviamente la gente podría haber empezado a quejarse más”, dijo.
Los inquilinos se manifestaron en diciembre 2023, enero 2024 y febrero 2025. Cada vez, exigieron al alcalde que responsabilizara al propietario por las condiciones de vida peligrosas y la falta de servicios básicos como la recolección de basura, la calefacción y el agua caliente. La última manifestación tuvo lugar el 3 de noviembre, exigiendo justicia por el incendio. 
Ávila, uno de los inquilinos que lleva viviendo más tiempo en el edificio, asegura que las condiciones de vida empeoraron después de que el dueño de siempre vendiera la propiedad a Alpha Capital Funds y, posteriormente, a All is Good LLC. La empresa administradora de los apartamentos era Arlington Group LLC, y ahora es Mint Management Group LLC.
En total, las propiedades 267 y 271 en la avenida Wethersfield han presentado 31 solicitudes de servicio al ayuntamiento por problemas de mantenimiento, tanto ‘urgentes’ como ‘no urgentes’. Estas incluyen fallas en la calefacción y la caldera, goteras en el techo que congelan las escaleras durante el invierno y reparaciones de puertas y ventanas.
Mint Management Group LLC afirma haber respondido a las solicitudes de mantenimiento.
“Tuvimos problemas de mantenimiento y los solucionamos; enviamos a nuestros trabajadores”, respondió un representante de la empresa. “Lamentamos mucho lo sucedido a nuestros inquilinos”.

Los registros públicos de Hartford muestran que la propiedad está legalmente a nombre de All is Good LLC. Sin embargo, la empresa administradora es Mint Management Group LLC, cuya solicitud de licencia de alquiler está incompleta. El arrendador legal directo es Israel Wiznitzer, quien también tiene una solicitud de licencia de alquiler incompleta en Hartford.
Wiznitzer no respondió para comentar al respecto.
Cristian Corza-Godinez, portavoz de la ciudad de Hartford, explicó que una solicitud se considera “completa” únicamente cuando se presenta el formulario de solicitud, junto con el pago de la tarifa correspondiente para la licencia. Si no se paga la tarifa, la solicitud se considera “incompleta”, lo que significa que no se ha tramitado. 
Las solicitudes de licencia de alquiler se gestionan a través del sistema en línea de la ciudad. Se notifica al propietario que debe pagar la tarifa, como se hizo en el caso del dueño de la propiedad 267 en la avenida Wethersfield por tres ocasiones. El siguiente paso es la notificación de una infracción por no completar la licencia de alquiler.
Sarah White, abogada del Centro de Vivienda Justa de Connecticut, dijo que las multas se imponen sobre el edificio como un gravamen y que este puede tener prioridad sobre las hipotecas. Incluso, la ciudad podría intentar ejecutar la hipoteca para cobrar las multas.
“La ciudad de Hartford seguirá utilizando todos los recursos a su alcance para responsabilizar a los propietarios problemáticos por sus acciones u omisiones”, declaró Corza-Godinez en un comunicado. “Altos funcionarios municipales han mantenido conversaciones continuas con los propietarios del edificio afectado, y el enlace municipal para inquilinos de la ciudad de Hartford ha estado presente en el lugar, dialogando directamente con los inquilinos para brindarles el apoyo necesario. En una ciudad donde tantas familias alquilan sus viviendas, el alcalde Arulampalam y su administración seguirán presionando a todos los propietarios para que cumplan con su obligación de proporcionar una vivienda adecuada a nuestros residentes”.
Los propietarios que no han completado la solicitud han recibido avisos de infracción para todos los edificios con 10 o más unidades. Si tienen solicitudes incompletas recibirán un aviso de infracción antes del 30 de noviembre, según informó el portavoz de la ciudad.
“‘¿Están esperando a que nuestro edificio se incendie?’ me dijeron los inquilinos el año pasado, porque llevamos años quejándonos de la forma en que están manteniendo este edificio, y sucedió, se incendió”, dijo Quintana.

Consecuencias
Tras el incendio, el edificio fue asegurado y catalogado como inseguro. Se les indicó a los inquilinos que no entraran, ya que se consideraría allanamiento. Sin embargo, ese fin de semana se produjeron robos, según la vecina Tangela Perry, quien llamó a la policía para reportarlos.
Se les permitió a los inquilinos recuperar sus pertenencias el 5 de noviembre, seis días después del incendio. La empresa que administra el edificio consiguió un contratista, quien prefirió no revelar su nombre, para abrir el inmueble cuyas entradas estaban selladas con tablones de madera.
Cuando los inquilinos comenzaron a entrar a sus apartamentos, se dieron cuenta de que no estaban muchas de las pertenencias valiosas de sus familias. Habían saqueado sus hogares.
“Todo eso se perdió y es irremplazable”, dijo el inquilino Ronald Bozeman, refiriéndose a las joyas de sus padres.

Cuando llegó la policía, los residentes denunciaron la pérdida y el robo de sus pertenencias. “Antes no tenía hogar. Solía ​​dormir en sofás ajenos. Trabajé muchísimo para llegar hasta aquí. Y a nadie le importa”, dijo el inquilino Ryan Pirre.
Quienes no tenían hijos expresaban sus emociones en voz alta, gritando o llorando al ver sus cuartos saqueados, con algunas paredes quemadas o destruidas por bomberos. Quienes sí los tenían, contuvieron lágrimas y empacaron mientras vecinos vigilaban a sus hijos e hijas que jugaban frente a los apartamentos.
Ávila permanecía en silencio mientras su hija le ayudaba a empacar ropa. Sus cassettes de video aún estaban en un cajón, y un sobre amarillo con fotos familiares yacía sobre su cama. “Quería llorar, sentía ese dolor por dentro, pero no me salían las lágrimas”, dijo.
Se les indicó a los inquilinos que recogieran sus pertenencias desde el miércoles 5 de noviembre hasta el viernes 7 de noviembre. El viernes, Ávila vio a los contratistas demoliendo partes del edificio, mientras los inquilinos aún estaban sacando sus pertenencias.
Mint Management LLC no respondió cuando se le solicitó un comentario al respecto.

Desplazados
Pirre lleva menos de seis meses viviendo en el 271 de la avenida Wethersfield. Ha pasado noches de insomnio tras el incendio, alojándose en un motel con su novia y sus tres gatos.
Gracias a la Ley de Asistencia para la Reubicación, Pirre, al igual que el resto de los desplazados, tiene derecho a recibir beneficios de reubicación por parte de la ciudad. Estos beneficios incluyen alojamiento de emergencia, como el motel en el que Pirre se alojó durante dos semanas, alojamiento temporal, almacenamiento de pertenencias, pago de gastos de mudanza y hasta 4,000 dólares para un nuevo apartamento.
Los recursos de la ciudad alivian preocupaciones inmediatas de los inquilinos en cuanto a la vivienda, pero el trauma persiste. “Me desperté de una pesadilla en la que el motel en el que me encontraba se estaba incendiando y tenía que volver a salvar a mis gatos, que tenía que sacar a mi novia de allí”, dijo Pirre.

Días después del incendio, Pirre estaba dando un paseo por Broad Street durante su descanso para almorzar cuando, en pleno día, revivió el trauma. “En ese mismo instante había otro incendio, e inmediatamente tuve un recuerdo muy intenso de aquel momento: el olor a madera quemada, la sensación de asfixia, el escozor en los ojos y la idea de que iba a morir. Tuve que cerrar los ojos, tuve que concentrarme solo en mi respiración”, recuerda.
Ávila cuenta que la noche del incendio no pudo dormir por un dolor en el pecho y cree que fue por haber inhalado humo. No consideró ir al hospital para que lo revisaran, había pedido un permiso sin goce de sueldo en su trabajo y solo podía pensar en resolver su situación de vivienda. “Estaba completamente abrumado, pensando: ‘He perdido mi casa y mis recuerdos’, así que pensé que el dolor de pecho desaparecería, y gracias a Dios, así fue”, dijo.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Board of Regents has tabled a vote on proposed bylaws for the University of Iowa Center for Intellectual Freedom after board members expressed concerns about just who would have control of the center’s advisory committee.
Developed by interim center director Luciano de Castro, the drafted bylaws would establish executive and scholar committees within the center’s advisory council to handle different academic and advisory duties.

While the board’s governance, finance and human resources committee gave initial approval for the bylaws Wednesday, regents suggested changing policies relating to eligibility requirements for committee membership, specifically that a certain number of people on each committee must be currently or formerly tenured at an R1 research institution.
Echoing concerns she shared when the center’s advisory board was first brought to the board of regents, Regent Nancy Dunkel said Wednesday she was concerned about out-of-state control of the center if Iowans are barred from committees due to not having tenure.
Regent Robert Cramer said during the board’s Thursday meeting that the bylaws still need some work.
“I do think we want to get those right, and we want to have them right not just for us right now, but for 10, 20, 30 years from now,” Cramer said.
As the center advisory council will hold its first meeting Nov. 18, Regent Christine Hensley suggested tabling approval of the bylaws until the council has time to discuss them, and then “determine next steps” from there.
The vote to delay the bylaws vote was unanimous.
“It has been a long process, and we have had a lot of input from various individuals, but I agree with the comment that it’s important that we get them exactly right,” Hensley said.

That’s according to a new analysis of water samples collected this summer across dozens of locations in New York and Connecticut, including 10 spots in Greenwich.
The samples showed elevated levels of fecal-indicator bacteria, like E.coli and Enterococcus.
While those bacteria often show up in higher concentrations following heavy rainfall, elevated levels of these bacteria are less likely to be seen on dry days.
But Save the Sound, an environmental advocacy organization that collected the water samples this summer, found elevated levels in several Greenwich locations even on dry days.
That’s unusual and could point to a bigger problem, said Peter Linderoth, the organization’s director of healthy waters and lands.
“If we have high levels of pathogen indicator bacteria during dry weather, there’s a strong likelihood that there might be an issue with the sanitary sewer infrastructure underground,” Linderoth said.
Greenwich has separate pipes that carry sewage and stormwater, but the pipes are often close together, Linderoth said.
“During dry weather, if you have cracks in the sanitary sewer pipes and there’s cracks in the old stormwater pipes too and they’re close by, the water can ooze out of the sanitary sewer pipes and can make its way into the storm sewer pipes and then just discharge freely into local water bodies,” Linderoth said, adding that leaking septic tanks could also be a factor.
In a statement, a representative from Greenwich’s Department of Public Works said several factors could be contributing to higher levels of bacteria, including “animal waste from both pets and wild animals, failing septic systems, or problems with individual sewer connections that are not under the Town’s responsibilities.”
The city said it will investigate reports of elevated bacteria levels, to determine the cause and that it will work to fix the problem or notify responsible parties.
5 Greenwich locations fail Connecticut’s safe swimming standard 
Of the 10 sites tested in Greenwich, Save the Sound said four met Connecticut’s safe swimming standards, including Byram River at Cliffdale Road, Indian Harbor Yacht Club, Mianus River and Greenwich Cove.
Six sites were not deemed safe to swim in, including East Branch Byram River, Pemberwick Creek, Horseneck Brook, Byram Park, Byram River at Comley Avenue, and Bryan River at South Water Street.
Although people don’t often swim in rivers and creeks, Lineroth said it’s important they meet standards set by the Clean Water Act, a federal law that regulates pollutants in water.
“Some of the waters we sample aren’t swimming beaches, of course, but we’re still evaluating them against that swimming criteria,” Linderoth said.
Interacting with contaminated water can cause a range of side effects, Linderoth said, including rashes, pink eye, gastrointestinal issues and wheezing.
The results will be sent to Greenwich’s First Selectman Fred Camillo and representatives from the Department of Public Works. A representative from Fred Camillo’s did not immediately respond for comment.

Tracey Mann, the 1st District congressman from Kansas, says he was glad to cast his vote to end the federal government shutdown and draw to a close the Democrats' ""temper tantrum"" about the budget. This September 2024 image is of Mann preparing for a candidate forum. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The U.S. House delegation from Kansas split along partisan lines Wednesday on the appropriations legislation drawing to a close the longest federal government shutdown in the nation’s history.
Republican U.S. Reps. Derek Schmidt, Tracey Mann and Ron Estes voted with the 222-209 majority on the shutdown’s 43rd day to approve the measure. The lone opponent from Kansas was Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids. On Monday, the deal cleared the U.S. Senate on a 60-40 vote with backing from U.S. Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran, both Kansas Republicans.
The resolution signed by President Donald Trump funded the government until Jan. 30, 2026.
“This long, unnecessary, and harmful federal government shutdown is finally about to end,” said Schmidt, of the eastern Kansas 2nd District. “I am hopeful Congress will now use the next two months to proceed under the regular order of finalizing full-year funding for the remaining government agencies and programs. No more hostage-taking. No more demands for backroom deals. Just line-by-line scrutiny of the federal budget.”
Senate Democrats for about six weeks withheld support for the closure-ending package in an attempt to secure extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits due to expire Jan. 1. In the end, Democrats settled for a December vote on the issue in the Senate.
Davids, who serves the Kansas City metropolitan area, said she declined to endorse the deal because U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, refused to commit to a House vote on extending subsidies tied to ACA health care premiums.
“I’ve said for weeks that we’ve got to come together and find a bipartisan compromise to open the government again,” she said. “But this can’t be at the expense of threatening health care for the more than 160,000 Kansans who rely on ACA credits to afford care and the thousands more who will see skyrocketing health care premiums.”
Davids said ending the shutdown meant federal employees would be back at work and receiving paychecks, but the fight to bring down the cost of health care wasn’t over.
“Kansans are sick of the political gamesmanship in Washington while people in Kansas pay the price,” she said.
Mann, serving a district covering much of rural Kansas as well as Lawrence, said he “proudly voted to bring this shutdown to an end once and for all.”
“The hardworking men and women who are the backbone of our country should not have their lives upended in exchange for Democrats’ pandering to their leftist base,” Mann said. “For 43 days, Washington Democrats have kept the federal government closed as they threw a temper tantrum and demanded that Congress adopt radical policy proposals like taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants.”
Mann repeated the claim also made by Trump that Democrats wanted to fund health care to people without the documentation to legally be in the United States. In fact, Democrats had sought repeal of a federal law denying Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program coverage to people who were “lawfully present” in the United States. That would benefit lawful permanent residents, refugees, parolees and individuals granted asylum, but not anyone in the country illegally.
Estes, who represents a district centered on Wichita, voted for the funding bill. He blamed Senate Democrats for holding the government hostage and demanding the GOP “give in to their radical political agenda.”
“Congressional Republicans are ready to enact President Trump’s priorities and continue delivering wins for Kansans and the American people,” Estes said.
The House approved a budget resolution in September that could have prevented the shutdown, but the Senate failed more than a dozen times to pass it.
Moran said he was relieved the Senate came around to a bipartisan short-term government funding patch and a set of appropriations bills for defense and agriculture. He said work on the federal budget was far from complete, and the new deadline loomed.
“Congress must work diligently to pass the remaining appropriations bills before the end of January to prevent another useless and unnecessary shutdown,” he said. “I’m committed to working with my colleagues to address the concerns they have, and any issues brought forth by the shutdown.”
He said shutdowns were damaging to the economy and highlighted dysfunction in Washington, D.C. The chaos also demonstrated for U.S. adversaries “we can’t work together to meet even the most fundamental responsibilities of Congress,” he said.
Marshall said the nation ought to salute the handful of Senate Democrats who represented “true courage” for siding with GOP members. He continued to denounce Senate Democrats who voted to hold the government hostage for political leverage.
“Now that the political games are over, I look forward to getting back to work and continuing to deliver on the America First agenda,” Marshall said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tracey-Mann-with-tie-choke-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 11:58:34.576359

(Photo by Getty Images)Xcel Energy wants to place dozens of high-voltage batteries at commercial sites across Minnesota over the next few years. Each would have 1 to 3 megawatts of capacity, enough to power hundreds of Minnesota homes with wind and solar power — even when the sky is dark and the air is still. 
Made possible by plummeting battery costs and rapid technology improvements, the proposal is significant for Xcel and Minnesota’s power grid, which state law requires to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2040. It’s part of a broader strategy by Xcel and other Minnesota utilities to expand grid-connected battery capacity from next to nothing in 2020 to hundreds of megawatts in 2030.   
As it scales to an initial capacity of 50 to 200 megawatts in 2028, Xcel’s distributed battery network will form a utility-controlled “virtual power plant” that soaks up power during periods of low demand and injects it back into the grid when it’s needed most. In the program’s first two of four phases, Xcel — not the site hosts — would own and operate the batteries, as it plans to do with larger-scale battery installations expected to come online later this decade.
Xcel says the first-of-its-kind distributed battery program, called Capacity*Connect, will keep the power grid reliable, support Minnesota’s carbon-free power mandate and meet rising electricity demand without the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. It could also indirectly reduce customers’ power bills by shifting Xcel’s energy purchases from higher- to lower-cost periods.
Utility watchdogs and clean power proponents say they support those goals. 
But they question whether a program that Xcel estimates could cost as much as $430 million over three years is a good use of ratepayer dollars, pointing to Xcel’s own calculations showing its quantifiable benefits falling modestly short of the expected costs. In a filing last month with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, Xcel asked regulators for permission to recover eligible program costs from customers, as it routinely does for other infrastructure projects.
Colorado got a better deal
A settlement between Xcel’s Colorado subsidiary and that state’s public utility commission earlier this year would see it administer a 125-megawatt virtual power plant program there for less than one-third the cost per megawatt of a 200-megawatt Minnesota network. 
The Colorado program allows energy resources other than batteries to participate, including smart thermostats, water heaters and EV chargers. While those resources don’t directly store electricity like batteries do, they can still reduce grid stress by shifting power demand away from peak periods. (In last month’s filing, Xcel said its Colorado cost calculations were specific to that state and “not directly applicable to Minnesota.”)
Clean power groups also note the early phases for which Xcel has provided the most detail are far less ambitious than the more than 800 megawatts of solar and battery capacity the utility envisioned in an initial filing in 2024. They favor a more competitive, faster-to-scale framework that invites non-utility partners into the mix and leverages Minnesota’s existing residential and community-scale solar arrays — something closer in spirit to Xcel’s Colorado program or a Minnesota alternative sketched out in a DFL-backed bill legislators may consider next year.
“The easiest way to stand up a program like this is to go back to existing solar customers and try to sell them on batteries,” said Shannon Anderson, distributed power plant policy director at Solar United Neighbors, in an interview. 
In its Minnesota filing last month, Xcel didn’t outright disagree. It did, however, say it needed to move deliberately to ensure that Capacity*Connect delivers on its promise while laying the technical groundwork for a more open and sophisticated distributed energy network that could take shape in Minnesota in the early 2030s. 
In the meantime, Xcel offers an upfront incentive for customers who want batteries for backup power. It’s worth $175 per kilowatt-hour on systems up to 50 kilowatt-hours, up to a maximum incentive of $5,000. That helps ease the bite of installing a home battery system, which typically costs more upfront — though less over a 20-year service life — than a diesel or gas generator. For non-Xcel customers, the Minnesota Department of Commerce pays $250 per kilowatt-hour or $7,000 total. Both programs offer higher incentives to low- and moderate-income customers.
Early next year, Xcel plans to launch a second program, Minnesota Battery Connect, that would pay residential and commercial battery owners to enroll small “behind-the-meter” systems in a separate, utility-operated virtual power plant. Xcel has yet to disclose payment amounts or limits for that program but said in an Oct. 31 filing that it would follow a successful Colorado initiative that has enrolled nearly 2,500 battery systems with incentive payments of $350 per kilowatt-hour. 
In front of v. behind the meter
Xcel says it will pay commercial customers enrolled in Capacity*Connect, too, though the public filing obscures the proposed amounts behind trade-secret redactions. But because the batteries will sit in front of the customers’ utility meters, they will be fully controlled by Xcel, which means those payments may be the only direct benefit they see. Customers with behind-the-meter batteries can more easily use them for backup power and to store energy generated by onsite solar panels, reducing their net energy costs. 
Xcel’s October filing acknowledged those behind-the-meter upsides but said the Capacity*Connect front-of-the-meter approach would more efficiently achieve system-wide reliability and cost benefits. 
In an email last month, Xcel spokesperson Theo Keith said the utility views distributed batteries “as any other investment we would make on our electricity grid” and said Capacity*Connect would reduce power constraints at key locations, allowing it to defer more expensive grid upgrades.
Keith also noted that Xcel separately works with “large customers” looking to install backup power systems at their facilities. 
Legislators look to mandate virtual power plant program
Outside groups — and representatives of publicly traded companies that stand to benefit from a more open, competitive battery network — say Minnesota can have its cake and eat it too. They point to success stories like California’s Demand Side Grid Support program, which in three years added 700 megawatts of capacity — enough to power more than 500,000 typical homes — managed by aggregators like Sunrun and Tesla Energy. In a two-hour event on a sweltering July evening, the network discharged 539 megawatts, nearly matching the output of the Monticello nuclear plant in central Minnesota.
“Instead of increasing costs through slow, unproven and untested programs, we hope Minnesota leaders will look to replicate the successes of distributed power plant programs to quickly, affordably meet the critical needs facing us here in the Midwest,” said Amy Heart, Sunrun’s Milwaukee-based senior vice president of policy.
A bill introduced in April by DFL Reps. Larry Kraft of St. Louis Park and Kari Rehrauer of Coon Rapids could help move things along. 
Beginning in 2026, it would require Xcel and other Minnesota electric utilities to propose a virtual power plant program that would reduce peak winter and summer electric loads by 10% or more within three years. Unlike the first phases of Capacity*Connect, the Kraft-Rehrauer bill would allow outside aggregators like Sunrun to operate energy assets in the program — though utilities themselves could also serve as aggregators.
Kraft said in an interview he was working to build bipartisan support for the bill and “hopefully get it passed in some fashion this session.” He framed it as a “yes, and” complement to the utility’s proposal, rather than an either-or alternative, and said he was heartened to see Xcel embracing grid batteries on a meaningful scale.
“More energy storage on the grid can have a hugely positive impact in terms of adding renewables and saving money for people…I would like to see a thriving market where we are unlocking the complete value of all of that,” Kraft said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1241219865.jpg,,,2025-11-13 10:58:32.026521

LaMonica McIver can proceed, rejecting McIver’s arguments that the assault charges are politically motivated and shielded as an official duty. 
U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper in his 41-page ruling dismissed McIver’s claims that she is the victim of selective prosecution and that most of the charges she faces are barred by legislative immunity. Prosecutors allege McIver assaulted federal agents on May 9 at a migrant jail in Newark as the agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. 
“Impeding an arrest, whether lawful or unlawful, goes beyond any reasonable definition of oversight and, accordingly, exceeds the safe harbor of legislative immunity,” Semper wrote.
It’s unclear when McIver’s trial will begin (it had been scheduled to start Monday but Semper delayed it pending Thursday’s ruling). Semper said he needs more facts to decide on McIver’s motion to dismiss the third charge she faces.
McIver has pleaded not guilty and maintained the charges are political retaliation for her unannounced inspection of the jail.
Her attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Missouri exceeds the national average for revenue earned by veteran-owned businesses as well as the prevalence of these businesses.


A business is considered veteran-owned if a military veteran owns 51% or more of its stock or equity.


Luke Dietterle, University of Missouri Extension specialist, released a report in October detailing the state of veterans in Missouri’s economy. It showed veteran-owned firms generate 2.3% of the state’s business revenue, which is above the national average of 1.8%


“The veterans in Missouri that are business owners tend to punch above their weight a little bit,” Dietterle said.


Although Oklahoma, Arkansas and Nebraska have higher densities of veteran-owned businesses, Missouri’s businesses generate higher shares of the state’s total revenue.


Veterans make significant contributions in several counties’ local economies. Sales attributed to veteran-owned businesses in Reynolds, Iron and Dent counties account for more than a quarter of the overall sales in those places.

Veterans are most represented in the arts, entertainment and recreation, with 8% of Missouri firms in this sector being veteran-owned. Wholesale trade follows close behind with 7% of firms.


The share of industry revenue generated by veteran-owned firms was highest in mining, quarry and oil and gas extraction, at 22%. Transportation and warehousing followed, with 13% of revenue attributable to veteran-owned firms.


Despite the success many veterans find in business, they still face significant barriers in the transition to civilian life.


“You’re not really going to have a credit history,” Dietterle said. “You’re not really going to have sufficient income to serve as collateral for a loan. These folks are just leaving the service, and they just haven’t had those experiences. They haven’t been able to build that record of financial responsibility.”

This is not the first time Hudson, a Genesee County truck driver who also ran for Congress in 2024, has targeted Dearborn, the nation’s largest Arab-majority city, in his campaign — in an October debate, he said that as governor he would authorize the National Guard to go into the city, again citing “Sharia law.” 
He further wrote on X that he was asking the National Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps to be present at the march, in the same post that he said that the march will be peaceful. 
“This gentleman is coming to provoke a response,” Walid said. “Let him come in and holler to the wind and the sky, and have him go about his business.”

FRONTLINE, PBS’s investigative documentary series produced at GBH in Boston, has selected VTDigger for a yearlong reporting partnership to examine the aftermath of Vermont’s severe flooding and the federal government’s shifting response to natural disasters.
Emma Cotton, who has served as VTDigger’s environmental reporter before becoming a senior editor, will lead the project’s reporting. Her work, as part of FRONTLINE’s Local Journalism Initiative, will investigate how this extreme weather has affected our residents, housing situation, farms, businesses and landscape.
“Our goal will be to investigate why some Vermont communities are struggling to recover from the floods and how they could be better supported in getting back on their feet,” said Geeta Anand, VTDigger’s editor-in-chief. “We will do this in conversation with people in these communities so that our reporting is deeply informed by those most affected by the floods.” 
VTDigger is one of seven newsrooms selected for FRONTLINE’s Journalism Initiative. Digger will team up with Blue Ridge Public Radio and The Texas Newsroom (the collaboration among NPR stations in the state), providing in-depth coverage of the impact and recovery efforts as we grapple with worsening weather and increased destruction.
“I’m so grateful to have FRONTLINE’s support, which enables us to dedicate a new level of resources to one of the most important stories in the state,” Cotton said. “I look forward to giving this story my complete attention over the next year, and I’m eager to connect with Vermonters across the state to understand how flooding has affected them and their communities.”
Vermont, long cast as a climate haven, is struggling to recover from back-to-back major flooding events, never mind prepare for the next ones. For each of the past three years, extreme flooding has taken place on the same day, July 10.
Small, rural towns, like those in southern Vermont and the Northeast Kingdom, have tiny, sometimes volunteer governments with limited capacity to plan for floods. Some of these towns are currently grappling with millions of dollars in debt — doubling their annual budgets in some instances.
“So many of us were personally affected by these floods — my road washed out two years in a row, and my former Montpelier business was destroyed in 2023,” said Sky Barsch, VTDigger’s CEO. “I know firsthand how vital it is to have deep, sustained reporting on what recovery entails. Under Geeta Anand’s leadership and with Emma Cotton’s excellent reporting, VTDigger is proud to partner with FRONTLINE to bring these stories to light.”

(Getty Images)West Virginia’s food stamp recipients will have their full November benefits on their cards either today or first thing Friday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Thursday. 
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, helps feed about 275,000 — or one in six — West Virginia residents. Benefits for November have been delayed since Nov. 1 because of the federal government shutdown.
Morrisey’s announcement comes after Congress approved legislation reopening the federal government, ending the longest federal government shutdown in United States history. Trump signed the bill into law Wednesday evening. 
During the delay, the state of West Virginia contributed about $13 million to food banks in the state as the state’s charitable food network saw an increased demand. Morrisey also activated the West Virginia National Guard to assist in food distribution and other efforts. 
“We’ve been involved helping every West Virginian in need of it to make sure no one goes hungry,” Morrisey said. “We had a system where no one goes hungry. That matters in West Virginia. I want to thank everyone involved for the successful effort over the last 13 days.”
Morrisey made the announcement while speaking at the Governor’s Energy Summit in Charleston.

Homicide rates among pregnant women increase with the rate of firearm ownership, according to a new study. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Homicide rates among pregnant women increase with the rate of firearm ownership, according to a state-by-state study published this week in the medical journal JAMA Network Open.
Researchers found the firearm homicide rate for pregnant women was 37% higher than the rate for nonpregnant women. Suspected perpetrators were most often male for both pregnant and nonpregnant women.
The study builds on previous research showing that women are more likely to be killed when they are pregnant: Homicide is a leading cause of maternal death, with firearms involved in a majority of killings, according to previous research.
Researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital analyzed data from 7,063 recorded homicides of women between 2018 and 2021 across 37 states.
Of those homicides, 434 victims were pregnant women. Black women made up a majority — 250 — of pregnant homicide victims, and about 78% of pregnant women were killed by a person using a firearm.
The team’s statistical analysis also found that for every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership, there was a 6% increase in all-cause homicides in pregnant women and an 8% increase in firearm-homicide rates in pregnant women.
Domestic violence in Native communities is focus of new survey

Louisiana had the highest rate of all-cause homicides in pregnant women. It also had the highest rate of killings in which a firearm was used, at 111 per one million live births, followed by Missouri, Alaska, West Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia and North Carolina.
“It is such an awful phenomenon that’s occurring in this country,” said Maeve Wallace, an epidemiologist and associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona. Wallace’s research has shown homicide to be a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death.
Wallace, who wasn’t involved in the new study, said it points to how lax firearm policies put women at risk.
“There’s been a real failure to address it at multiple levels, including in maternity care, in communities and addressing the ability for people to thrive and be safe and healthy,” she said.
Because there is insufficient data on state-level firearm ownership, the authors of this study and other researchers use “proxy” measures to estimate those figures, such as extrapolating from statistics on suicides by firearm.
Police officers can help prevent domestic violence killings by asking the right questions

Liz Tobin-Tyler, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health who studies intimate partner violence, said pregnancy is “the most vulnerable time for intimate partner violence and homicide.”
The study “highlights the disproportionate risk of firearm-related homicide for Black women during pregnancy,” she said, “an often overlooked contributor to disparities in maternal mortality.”
She added that the fact that researchers only had information from 37 states points to the need for better state data collection and reporting on violence against women.
“With the cuts to federal agencies, like the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], this data will likely be even more difficult to obtain,” Tobin-Tyler said. “We cannot act on these problems if we do not document them.”

(Photo courtesy of Leslie Rubin/WCHS)A miner missing in a flooded West Virginia coal mine was found dead Thursday morning, according to Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The governor released the name of the miner, Steve Lipscomb, who had worked as a foreman at Alpha Metallurgical Resources’ Rolling Thunder mine in Nicholas County.
“Governor Patrick Morrisey and First Lady Denise Morrisey were heartbroken to learn of this tragic loss and are keeping Mr. Lipscomb’s family, friends, and fellow workers in their prayers. Today, we grieve for this terrible tragedy and honor the life of one of our own,” Morrisey posted on his X account.
A mining crew hit an unknown pocket of water Nov. 8 about three-quarters of a mile into the Rolling Thunder mine, resulting in the flood. All other miners working on the site were accounted for. Nicholas County Commissioner Garrett Cole posted on Facebook that Lipscomb had “worked to ensure that everyone on his crew was getting out of the mine.”
Crews have been working for days to lower water levels inside the Rolling Thunder Mine so they could search for Lipscomb. Morrisey told reporters that he had called on national experts, including the National Cave Rescue Commission, to help with the complicated rescue due to the level of water in the mine.
“Crews had worked tirelessly around the clock in 12-hour shifts in a search for their colleague. Each shift included roughly 15 workers underground, 8 on the surface coordinating and loading supplies, and another 8 staging and fusing a new waterline,” Morrisey posted.
Crew were able to enter this mine this morning after water levels had lowered sufficiently for a safe entry. 
“Over the past several days, crews have worked around the clock with courage, skill, and determination, doing everything humanly possible to bring their colleague home. Their commitment and teamwork reflect the very best of West Virginia,” Morrisey said.

Nov. 12, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMembers of the Michigan House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday took comment on a series of bills centered on the application process for concealed pistol licenses, including a proposal to lower the age requirement. 
Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell), whose House Bill 4586 would lower the age to apply for a concealed carry permits from 21 to 18, argued that at 18 years old, Michigan residents are able to vote, pay taxes, and enlist in the military, and should thus be trusted with the same right to self defense granted to other law-abiding citizens. 
“Right now, Michigan tells us that an 18-year-old soldier or Marine that are mature enough to deploy overseas and carry a service weapon for our country, but somehow, is not responsible enough to carry a sidearm to protect themselves in their own neighborhood.” Woolford said. “This doesn’t make sense to me.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When presenting the bill to the committee, Woolford stressed that the policy would not touch any of the safeguards in the law around concealed pistol licensing – including background checks, training requirements, and disqualifying offenses – it merely lowers the age limit. 
He also noted that under the existing law, 18-year-olds can purchase a handgun from a private individual, though they must be 21 to purchase a gun from a federally licensed dealer. 
Brady Schickinger, the executive director for the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners, further argued that Woolford’s bill would make the state law more uniform, as 18-year-olds are already legally permitted to purchase and own a firearm and to open carry a pistol. The committee’s chair, Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), noted that her sons are able to take the safety training class for a concealed pistol license, they can’t actually get their license until they’re 21. 
However, the bill was not without criticism, with both Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety taking a position against the bill. 
Gail Duncan of Charlotte told the committee that she’d joined Moms Demand Action after her daughter was killed at work, with the gunman later taking his own life.
She noted that firearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens and warned that individuals 18 to 20 commit homicide with guns at three times the rate of adults 21 and older. 
“The area of the brain responsible for judgment and impulse control is not fully developed in 18, 19 and 20 year olds, meaning that they can be more prone to aggressive behavior,” Duncan noted, calling on committee members to oppose the policy.

The committee also heard testimony on bills focused on how these licenses are issued. 
Rep. Pat Outman’s (R-Six Lakes) House Bill 5113 creates a grace period to correct errors on their application for a concealed pistol license if their initial application is disqualified due to either an applicant or administrative error, while Rep. Matt Maddock’s (R-Milford) House Bill 4980 reintroduced a policy first brought by former state Rep. Gary Eisen (R-St. Clair Township) during his tenure in the House.
The policy would allow individuals to apply for a concealed pistol license in any county, whereas currently they are currently required to submit their application to the county clerk in their county of residence, or directly to Michigan State Police, who forward it to the appropriate clerk. 
The bill had received bipartisan support when it was first introduced, with Eisen explaining that the legislation came from his work as a concealed pistol license instructor, with some students reporting monthslong waiting periods, while others were able to receive their license on the next day, if not the same day.
While Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) raised concerns about how the bill would be implemented, asking whether county clerks used the same system in processing these applications, Maddock noted that every county has a mechanism and procedure in place to review these applications, and that the counties whose delays could stem from a large number of applications also receive more revenue from the fees in order to process them.

“In my opinion, there’s no excuse for Wayne County or Washtenaw County to have a long waiting period, because they’re getting that additional revenue,” Maddock said. 
While the committee did not vote on any of the bills up for testimony, they did approve House Bill 4284, which would reduce the fee for renewing a concealed pistol license from $115 to $30. While $36 of the current renewal fee is forwarded to county treasurers for deposit into their concealed pistol licensing fund, all $30 of the new fee would go toward the fund.
The panel voted 7-2 along party lines to refer the policy to the House floor for further action, after shooting down a proposed amendment from Rep. Tyron Carter (D-Detroit). Carter and Rep. Helena Scott (D-Detroit) voted in opposition to the policy.

Santiago/Getty Images)Immigrants who have recently been held at the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center say that conditions at the facility, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lockup in rural Evangeline Parish, have deteriorated as more and more people have been held there over the past year.
In interviews, a man detained at Pine Prairie through June and a legal consultant for another man held there this summer described a crowded facility with scarce resources — men sleeping on floors due to an alleged lack of beds inside packed dormitories; detainees wearing the same uniforms for several days because they weren’t given a change of clothing (not even underwear), pleading with staff for hygiene products to keep themselves clean and denied access to medical care and other services.
“These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life,” said Alexandra Smolyar, an attorney at Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice who consulted with the man detained at Pine Prairie over the Summer.
Pine Prairie, which is run by the private prison corporation the GEO Group, has a contract with ICE that calls for a maximum daily population of 500. But it has been operating well above its contractual capacity of 500 detainees since as early as mid-April, according to information from data research organization Transactional Records Access Clearing House at Syracuse University, or TRAC. While ICE reported that Pine Prairie had an average daily population of 788 on Sept. 15, the most recent date for which a count is available, TRAC researchers have calculated the average population at that time at 915 people.
Since President Trump was sworn in for his second term — promising an unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants, no matter whether they have criminal records or are considered dangerous — the number of people being held in immigration detention has skyrocketed by 69%, from just over 39,000 in December to about 66,000 today.

Complaints from immigrant rights advocates about poor conditions inside detention centers are not uncommon. In 2020 and 2021, federal oversight bodies received several complaints from advocates about lack of hygiene products and personal protective equipment inside Louisiana’s immigration detention facilities, including Pine Prairie, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As that detained population has grown in 2025, media reports and advocates have described cramped quarters where living conditions have gone from bad under the Biden Administration, to much worse under Trump.
Advocates told Verite News that Pine Prairie is a case in point. They said capacity issues are leading to worsening conditions at the facility, which already had a long history of complaints alleging human rights abuses and civil rights violations.
“This year it feels much worse,” said Tania Wolf, an advocacy manager at the National Immigration Project, who has gone on frequent visits to ICE detention centers in Louisiana. “It feels like things are getting to a point where things are gonna boil over in terms of conditions.”
A ‘horrible pressure point’
Lenin, a Honduran citizen who was detained at Pine Prairie from October 2024 until he was deported in June, said in an interview last week that conditions at the facility were poor during the entirety of his stay. Lenin, who said he fled his birth country in 2015 after MS-13 gang members allegedly killed a close relative and threatened to kill him, asked Verite News to publish only his middle name because he fears for his safety since he has returned to Honduras.
Lenin said when he first arrived at Pine Prairie he was placed in a crowded dorm where some men slept on the floor. He said that he and other detainees had been given only one pair of underwear and one uniform, leaving them with no way of changing into clean clothes for days. They had difficulty getting hygiene items, including soap, shampoo, toothpaste and at times even toilet paper, Lenin said. The dorm was kept cold and staff would not respond to detainees’ requests to increase the temperature, he alleged, adding that staff often denied him visits to the medical unit to receive medication or treatment for anxiety and depression.
“They don’t treat us like humans,” Lenin said. “If you don’t speak English, you can’t have anything,”
In late July and in early August, attorney Alexandra Smolyar, at the Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, sent emails to immigrant rights lawyers who work in Louisiana, including Wolf, alleging “absolutely abysmal” conditions inside Pine Prairie, relayed to her by a detainee with whom she had consulted.
ICE keeps detaining pregnant immigrants — against federal policy

The details laid out in her emails are similar to the conditions that Lenin described — inadequate clothing leading to detainees wearing the same clothes for days on end, guards shouting and using profanity when speaking to detainees, staff skipping nightly pill calls causing people to miss medications, detainees getting the wrong medication.
“Overcrowding is growing more dire by the day; medical care is severely lacking; there’s no access to a law library or mail,” she wrote in an August email. “The conditions are really harrowing.”
In a September interview, Smolyar said the Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, who has since been deported, described to her a packed intake area for people initially booked into the facility with one shower, one toilet and one sink and detainees sleeping on bare mattresses set on the floor of a holding cell. (Smolyar declined to identify the former Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, but she said he was deported in August.)
“It epitomized how the expansion of detention is coming to this horrible, horrible pressure point where people’s lives are in jeopardy every day,” Smolyar said.
Wolf said she had already become concerned about overcrowding at Pine Prairie in July, when she attended a standard tour of the detention center.
Wolf said she and others on the tour — which was approved by ICE officials — repeatedly asked staff and accompanying ICE agents for a count of detainees booked into the facility that day. In her notes, Wolf wrote that the group was never given a population count. The omission, she said, was very unusual.
When the tour got to the visitation area — a space where detainees often meet with attorneys — Wolf said it looked more run down than in previous visits she’d made to Pine Prairie.
“It just looked a little bit more — for lack of a better term — lived in,” Wolf said.
Wolf said detainees later told her that some of them had been sleeping in the visitation unit due to overcrowding. In a phone interview this week, Wolf said she’d never heard of a facility making detainees sleep in its visitation area before then.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the GEO Group, the company that operates Pine Prairie, denied claims of worsening living conditions at the facility.
“GEO strongly rejects these baseless claims, which are preposterous and bizarre,” wrote GEO Group Director of Corporate Relations Christopher Ferreira. “The Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center provides high quality support services that adhere to ICE’s detention standards and contract requirements, which provide for ample access to pre-scheduled recreation opportunities both indoors and outdoors. Individuals at the Center are in no way deprived of natural light nor are they subjected to excessive artificial light.”
In an emailed statement, ICE spokesperson Tamara Spicer, did not answer specific questions about conditions at Pine Prairie but said the agency is experiencing “unprecedented operational demands” due to “recent unlawful border crossings.”
“ICE has appropriately intensified enforcement operations to restore integrity to the system,” Spicer said. “The volume of apprehensions is not the result of ICE policy but the direct result of individuals choosing to break the law. ICE will not apologize for enforcing U.S. law.”
Problems with ICE’s population figures
ICE provides bimonthly reports with “snapshots” of the total number of detainees in its custody in each state and overall. But, for individual facilities, the agency only reports the average daily population — pooling numbers from the start of the fiscal year (October 1) through the present day. The result is a skewed perception of how many people are detained at a facility at any given time.
In April, ICE reported that Pine Prairie detained an average of 689 people — though ICE records show the population reached as high as 923 on April 13, a number obtained by TRAC through a Freedom of Information Act request.
Data researchers have responded to the lack of consistent data on daily population counts by creating a new method to calculate the average daily populations that they say provides more accurate results for how many people are currently (or have recently been) detained at a facility. To find the “interval average daily populations,” as they call it, researchers compare the two most recently reported average daily populations and then compare that number to the total days between when those two average daily population numbers were reported.
Researchers publish the most recent interval average daily population figures for individual ICE detention centers on deportationreports.com, a directory with information about ICE facilities. According to the site, on Sept. 2, Pine Prairie’s interval daily population was 1,010 detainees, more than double its contractual capacity and 233 people and more than ICE’s reported average population for the same day of 783 people.
State’s challenge to New Orleans jail ‘sanctuary’ policy can move forward, judge rules

Overcrowding in ICE facilities began making headlines in March, when images and video from inside Krome detention center in Miami showed detainees sleeping on floors with cardboard boxes for makeshift mattresses.
According to data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests and analyzed by researchers at TRAC, nearly half of all ICE facilities in the country were housing more detainees than their contracts with ICE allowed as early as April.
That data showed two other Louisiana facilities, Richwood Correctional Center and Winn Correctional Center, run by private prison company LaSalle Corrections, were operating over their contractual capacities by several dozen detainees.
LaSalle Corrections did not respond to emailed requests for comment on its facilities’ operating over capacity.

Backed up
Wolf said that on the tour at Pine Prairie, staff referred to the detention center as an “overflow” facility for ICE’s staging facility in Alexandria that sits on the tarmac of an international airport that is the Department of Homeland Security’s main deportation hub. Considered the final stop for many migrants before they are removed from the U.S., the staging facility is supposed to hold detainees for 72-hours or less, while ICE prepares for their deportation flights. However, in September, the Guardian reported that many detainees are being held at Alexandria for longer than three days.
“For the system to work … the people who are going to be funneled into the staging facility need to be somewhere else in the weeks preceding,” said Norah Ahmed, legal director at ACLU of Louisiana.
According to Ahmed, Pine Prairie appears to be operating as a pre-staging facility — holding detainees with orders of deportation who may have exhausted their options for legal ways to remain in the country while their deportation flights are being prepared. She said when flights don’t take off as planned, due to unforeseen circumstances, such as negotiation breakdowns between the U.S. and countries accepting deportees, sometimes people get returned to Pine Prairie after it has already accepted new residents to take their place, contributing to overcrowding.
Lenin spent roughly nine months at Pine Prairie. As the facility was growing more crowded, Lenin said, he was in solitary confinement. He said staff told him it was for his own safety after a confrontation with other detainees. He said he told staff members that isolation, inside a small room with no windows to the outside world and where the hallway lights were kept on continuously, might exacerbate his anxiety and depression. But he remained in segregation, he said until his deportation in June.
Smolyar, who works mainly with people detained in Georgia, said she fears that, in the months since the detainee she was consulting with at Pine Prairie was deported, things have gotten worse.
“We’re seeing incredibly high numbers of people being detained. They’re being pushed to a breaking point,” Smolyar said. “These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life.”

(Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Kan. — A Kansas City, Kansas-based international nonprofit is leading people from 17 developing countries out of poverty through individualized projects. 
Unbound’s approach is to empower the people it serves to identify needs and make funding decisions. 
“Traditionally how that’s done is by designing programs at a global level, a top-down sort of method,” said Becky Findley, Unbound’s vice president of program development. “But at Unbound we really try to listen to families and hear what their needs are and respond to that. That way it’s more of a bottom-up approach.”
Monica Gomez has spent more than two decades at Unbound, where she now serves as a program director overseeing Latin America. Gomez, who spoke to Kansas Reflector through a translator, said a successful example of bottom-up aid is the Agents of Change program — where community members identify a need, draft a plan to address it, and submit it to Unbound. The approved proposals are showcased online, where donors can choose to fund them directly.
The proposals aren’t always funded entirely by Unbound. They often hinge on partnerships with local governments — for permits or funding. Unbound’s role, as Gomez describes it, is in part to provide funding and in part to equip community members with the skills to secure those resources themselves.
“This program comes to let the families and communities identify their own problems and find grants that they can use to solve those problems,” Gomez said. “I think that every proposal that comes from this program shows the heart of Unbound. Our heart tells us to listen, accompany, and walk with the families that we serve, and when the communities see themselves as (agents of change), they trust and they start making the change.”
In Honduras, Gomez visited an Agents of Change project where community members had built a dedicated shelter at the cemetery for mourners to say goodbye. Gomez said Unbound gave $500 to the project.
“With much pride they shared with me about having this place with a roof and walls, a dignified place for them to say goodbye,” Gomez said. “This took them to different authorities to get permissions, to get grants from the government, and this made them feel really empowered.”
Malou Navio is an Unbound program director who has overseen Agents of Change projects in Asia and Africa. She helped put street lighting in rural areas, build bridges across rivers for easier access to food, put latrines in schools, and build wells.
“The Innovation (Fund) we call macro projects. Medium to macro,” Navio said. “Agents of Change are our micro projects.”
The Innovation Fund is a new program that allocates $500,000 to support new projects proposed by Unbound participants. From the 23 submissions, a council of Unbound participants selected 12 initiatives to receive funding ranging from $20,000 to $60,000.
The Unbound headquarters are off Southwest Boulevard in Kansas City, Kansas, just feet away from Missouri. (Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)
Findley, Unbound’s vice president of program development, said the fund “is a way to create larger programs that target larger populations, larger communities, larger needs that go beyond the individual or the family, that still allows people who would benefit from the program to be in control of the resources.”
In Tamil Nadu, India, $21,000 went to a project aimed at getting 300 working mothers formal credentials. The mothers were identified by social workers.
“Their skills are high end,” Navio said. “Only, they have no formal credentials to point to, so they are underpaid. They are now working with the universities to certify their skills, their experience and their expertise.”
After the funds were received in July, the past three months have been spent identifying the strengths and needs of each mother and preparing their leave from work.
In Guatemala, $60,000 went to a project aimed at providing clean water to 600 families. The project has already installed 1.5 kilometers of water lines, and once the infrastructure is installed families will be paying for their own water service.
“It’s important to mention that the total cost of this project is three times more than what Unbound has given to the families,” Gomez said. “This is why families have been given labor as their way of promoting this, also carrying out different activities to generate more income — to take this project to a happy ending.”
Donors decide where their money goes in Unbound — to the Agents of Change grants, Scholarship Program, Critical Needs Fund, Global Classmates, Birthday Fund, or the Christmas Fund. They can also make a general donation, which is used to pay for things like the Innovation Fund.
“Right now we don’t really get too much grant funding,”  Findley said. “That’s something that we’re dipping our toes into, but with the closure of USAID, primarily it’s a lot of individuals which I think is another cool aspect.”
The U.S. Agency for International Development distributed food and aid around the world for six decades until the Trump administration closed the agency and canceled most of its programs earlier this year.
Donors to Unbound also can directly sponsor a child or elder through a monthly donation program, which Findley said has been sustainable.
A large part of the individual donors are Catholic. The organization was founded in 1981 by two Catholic missionaries and spent the 1980s and 1990s funding other Catholic missionaries.
“But then in the early 2000s we shifted to having our own standalone programs,” Findley said. “What we see now is that it was the foundation of faith that really established the values of the organization, but we don’t choose participants based on religion.”

The state has made significant progress over the past decade in making it easier for motorists to afford to purchase an electric vehicle and install chargers in homes. 
But Massachusetts has yet to tap funding from a key federal program to install chargers throughout the state’s network of major highways, the state’s Department of Transportation confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon.  
And now, the implosion of a major contract the state awarded to redevelop 18 service plazas along the Massachusetts Turnpike is bound to push back the installation of even more EV chargers. 
“All these things together make it harder to achieve our deployment goals,” said Eric Bourassa, director of transportation at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and a member of the state’s Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Coordinating Council. 
Those delays underscore the challenges facing the state in cutting pollution from the transportation sector, which accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in Massachusetts at 37 percent. Widespread adoption of electric vehicles is a crucial part of those efforts, but the state remains far off its goals for the chargers needed to both increase consumer confidence in the technology and power the vehicles once they are on the road.  
There were 9,413 publicly accessible charging ports in Massachusetts as of May, the fourth-highest rate per capita in the country, but the state would need to triple its annual rate of new charging deployments through 2030 to achieve its climate commitments, according to the most recent state data. 
The latest blow to the state’s EV charging efforts is the byproduct of a larger debacle around the state Department of Transportation’s attempts to refurbish the turnpike service plazas. The winning bidder, Irish company Applegreen, backed out during final negotiations — and with it went the nearly 800 EV chargers it pledged to install over the course of the 35-year contract, dozens of which were set to be deployed next year.  
It’s not clear how many charging stations will ultimately be called for at the service plazas as the state starts from scratch and launches its rebid of the process. The original request the state released last year tied much of the charging installation requirements to studies on future demand, which remains murky, especially after Massachusetts paused its EV sales requirements for manufacturers earlier this year. 
The new bid has not yet been released, and the state transportation department declined to comment on when it might be or what it may include, citing active litigation involving the department and Global Partners, the Massachusetts-based company that sued the department after it lost the original bid to Applegreen.  
Global Partners didn’t comment on the specifics of the EV charging plans it laid out in its original bid beyond saying that it remains “committed” to reapplying in the next bidding process and that expanding EV charging is part of its “bold plan” for the plazas. 
The transportation department is “balancing multiple goals” with a complicated contract like this one, said Bourassa, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council transportation specialist. “These are the hardest procurements to do in state government. You’re trying to accomplish 10 different goals. You want this awesome new plaza that’s going to have great amenities for motorists and new facilities and new restaurants. You want electric vehicle charging. You want revenue. You’re trying to get that balance.” 
The two companies involved in the turnpike service plaza dispute, ironically, are a central part of the state’s strategy to install chargers along Massachusetts highways through a different initiative, where the state has been slow to act.  
Massachusetts has yet to deploy any EV chargers through the $64 million in federal money the state was awarded as part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, the transportation department confirmed, despite a five-year goal to install at least 92 charging ports through NEVI funding. Nearby states like Rhode Island and New York, on the other hand, have moved ahead faster in building out the charging stations under the federal program.  
The state selected Applegreen, Global Partners, and a third company, Weston & Sampson, as developers under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Those companies are proposing charging sites to the Department of Transportation, which have not yet been approved, the department said. 
“This has had a lot to do with the way we went about procuring contractors and professionals,” said Jim Aloisi, a former state transportation secretary who now lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and serves on the board of the advocacy group TransitMatters. “Procurement is something that is kind of boring from a public perspective. But it’s almost always a barrier to moving quickly. I don’t think Massachusetts did anything to expedite it.” 
But even as Massachusetts officials are still figuring out how to supply the necessary chargers on highways to ease “range anxiety” — the worry of EV drivers about whether they’ll make it to their destination, or the next charging station — the state and local communities are sifting through the complicated challenges of deploying chargers on town streets and parking lots and connecting them to the electrical grid. 
Aloisi said since most driving is local, he wants the state to dedicate more money to municipalities in order to accelerate deployment of chargers, and in the metro Boston area, to install them at commuter rail station parking lots — to get people out of their cars in the first place. 
“It’s great that we have the federal money to deploy NEVI in Massachusetts, but that’s not going to solve anywhere close to our needs,” he said. “We could be providing more direct funding to cities and towns. They know their streetscape. They know where the right spots are. We’d be much better off doing that as a way to encourage more and more people to even consider the transition to EVs.” 
Massachusetts has advanced a number of policies to boost the uptake of EVs over the last decade. The Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive Program funds charging infrastructure, the state has expanded a rebate for EV purchases, and the electric utility companies have launched programs to install EV chargers at homes, workplaces, and publicly accessible areas. 
Plus, Beacon Hill enacted a “right to charge” rule last year to make it easier for residents of multi-family buildings to have charging infrastructure at their condo or apartment complex.   
With those policies in place, there’s a “real desire to get this right,” Bourassa said. “Sometimes that means it takes longer, because we have gotten it wrong in the past,” he said, pointing to past instances of broken highway chargers on the turnpike.  
Still, with looming emissions reduction mandates and a squeeze on additional help coming from Washington, time is of the essence. 
“Any delay is bad,” said Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, regarding the stalled service plaza chargers and slow-moving NEVI plans. “There’s no way to sugarcoat that. We need to triple the pace of deployment between now and the end of the decade to build enough EV charging stations to meet our climate requirements. So any delay has ramifications on that front.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Electric-Chargers-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-13 09:57:45.963523

As Kristen Moreland waited for the livestream to buffer, her thoughts drifted to the years she’d devoted to defending Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the northeastern sweep of Alaska where the mountains give way to the coastal plain. On screen, the chatter of aides stilled as men in dark suits gathered behind a lectern. Then Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced plans to open the area, roughly the size of South Carolina, to drilling.
It marked another round in the decades-long tug-of-war over developing one of the country’s largest remaining protected areas — an effort that came to a head during President Donald Trump’s first term, and ground to a halt when President Joe Biden took office. Burgum also restored seven oil and gas leases that a state-funded corporation bid on during the final days of the first Trump administration, and that his successor later revoked.
Moreland, a Gwich’in leader and executive director of the tribal committee dedicated to protecting the Nation’s sacred coastal plain, sat stunned as the YouTube stream continued. The place she grew up — where generations have lived on the tundra alongside the caribou, weaving their history into the land — had been reduced to a line item on someone’s balance sheet. When Burgum said opening the refuge would benefit northern communities, “it felt like a slap in the face,” she said.
“They’ve never reached out to us to listen to how this would affect our livelihood,” she said. Moreland fears development will drive the herd that the Gwich’in rely on out of range and contaminate rivers in a region where hunting and fishing are a matter of survival. For her, it felt like erasure. “It’s another disrespectful action from decision-makers,” she said. “It ignores our voice as Gwich’in and violates our rights as Indigenous people.”
As the fight over development in the Arctic continues, federal officials are racing to fulfill Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda. Though the government is shut down and many employees are not getting paid, officials continue approving permits for extractive industries. In a wood-paneled Beltway office, Burgum framed his “sweeping package of actions” as a declaration that “Alaska is open for business.”
To that end, the administration also signed permits for the controversial 211-mile Ambler Road to mineral deposits, including one owned by Trilogy Metals — which the Trump administration now holds a 10 percent stake in — and authorized a land exchange that will allow for construction of a road through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, at the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula. “I told the president it’s like Christmas every morning,” Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy said. “I wake up, I go to look at what’s under the proverbial Christmas tree to see what’s happening.”
Last week’s announcement may not end up being the gift the governor is hoping for.

The fight over drilling in the refuge began almost as soon as President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the site, once called Arctic National Wildlife Range, in 1960. The most recent volley began in 2017, when Trump signed a tax bill requiring two oil and gas lease sales there within seven years. When the first sale was held in 2021, the state corporation Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, or AIDEA, was the only major bidder. It hoped to keep drilling prospects in the region alive, despite weak industry interest. The sale ultimately generated less than $12 million — a fraction of the nearly $2 billion projected by the Tax Act for the last decade.
The Biden administration later found the leasing program’s environmental review inadequate. It conducted a new analysis, then canceled the leases in 2023, citing “fundamental legal deficiencies” and its failure to “properly quantify” greenhouse gas emissions. The second mandated sale, in early 2025, received no bidders. Compounding the challenge, major banks and insurers have refused to finance or underwrite projects in the refuge, citing environmental risks. Oil majors have also steered clear: In 2022, Chevron and the company that took over BP’s leases on private land within the refuge paid $10 million to walk away from them. That same year, Exxon Mobil told shareholders it has “no plans for exploration or development” there.
Still, this spring Trump issued an executive order calling for the reinstatement of AIDEA’s leases, and a federal court ruled that their cancellation was handled improperly. The state-funded investment firm remains the sole holder of leases in the refuge.
The problem is AIDEA doesn’t have the capital or technical expertise to build out these areas on its own. It has authorized spending nearly $54 million to develop them and move permitting for Ambler Road forward. That includes hiring consultants for seismic testing to map oil and gas deposits. But first it must get permission from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to harass polar bears, something that has sparked viral protests in the past. AIDEA authorized another $50 million for Ambler following Burgum’s announcement.
Ultimately, the state corporation is spending public money on infrastructure that private firms would normally fund, while sidestepping oversight, said Suzanne Bostrom, a senior staff attorney at Trustees for Alaska. The watchdog legal organization accused AIDEA of having redirected money toward refuge leases and Ambler from accounts within its Arctic Infrastructure Development Fund, and later its Revolving Fund, to avoid the need for legislative approval. Randy Ruaro, AIDEA’s executive director, wrote in an email that it was not legally required to seek authorization.
All of that aside, AIDEA’s track record is pretty grim. Financial records suggest the corporation lost at least $38 million on its last oil and gas venture, the Mustang field on the North Slope west of the refuge. After oil prices fell in 2020, the corporation foreclosed on the project. The state provided another $22 million in a 2023 bailout before AIDEA sold the field for an undisclosed sum. Bostrom says AIDEA has “no actual plan for seeing a return” on its spending in the refuge. In fact, the people of Alaska often lose money in its deals; one analysis found that almost half of the agency’s investments have been written off as worthless. The economists who crunched those numbers found the state would have come out about $11 billion ahead if that money had been put to work elsewhere.
In an email, Ruaro called the analysis a “hit piece” and said the corporation has  recorded its best financial performance in six decades over the past two years. He said that analysis “failed to account for the billions of dollars generated in economic benefits” by the Red Dog Mine, which produces lead and zinc in northwest Alaska. The corporation poured $160 million — about one-third of the project’s startup costs — into infrastructure to support the operation. At the same time, AIDEA’s own consultants concluded that the mine would be built regardless, and the investment was unnecessary. “AIDEA loves to point to the Red Dog mine as a shining example of their success,” Bostrom said, but even taking those claims at face-value “doesn’t erase that AIDEA still has no viable financial plan in place to cover the cost of building the Ambler Road.”
Ultimately, any plans for the refuge and Ambler Road — which the Bureau of Land Management has said would harm Indigenous and low-income communities — raise questions about who benefits from such development. AIDEA has, for example, proposed financing the private Ambler road through Gates of the Arctic National Park with bonds repaid by tolls, a plan critics call unrealistic, given the cost could hit $2 billion. “It’s hugely problematic for the state to issue bonds with no viable plan for repayment,” Bostrom said. “That’s not a good investment decision.”
But Ruaro wrote that is only one of several options, and that he is “confident the mines … have billions of dollars in minerals needed by the nation.” He also said AIDEA now estimates the cost at $500 to $850 million, and said the road can be built in phases.
Even with prudent financial strategies, the economics of extraction remain precarious — especially as domestic oil prices dropped below $60 a barrel this summer. Given the average breakeven price of $62, new Arctic production may not be profitable — though it would extend the life of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline that carries crude from the North Slope. The U.S. is already the world’s top producer, and more output won’t necessarily lower consumer fuel prices, says Boston University’s Robert K. Kaufmann, because OPEC and other nations still influence global markets. (As to the “energy emergency” that Trump declared, Kaufmann said, “I want what he’s smoking.”) Instead, the leases will bring more production online when “any rational scientist is calling for reducing carbon emissions.
Despite the risks, some communities in the region support new oil and gas projects. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge sits within North Slope Borough, which is larger than 39 states. Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat — a nonprofit funded by the regional Alaska Native Corporation — notes that 95 percent of the borough’s tax revenue comes from the industry, funding things like schools and clinics. Fossil fuel royalties directly benefit Indigenous communities like Kaktovik, funding essential services. “When Uncle Doug [Burgum] calls, I answer,” Josiah Patkotak, the borough’s mayor, said in a statement praising the Interior secretary’s announcement.

It can be difficult to disentangle genuine local support from efforts quietly backed — or directly compensated — by the industry itself. During a legislative hearing earlier this year, state Representative Ashley Carrick said one person who testified as a community advocate was paid by AIDEA, something Ruaro confirmed to her that it routinely does. This can create the impression these projects are widely embraced.
“There’s this wide consensus that [Iñupiat] people all want the oil and gas projects. It’s not true,” said Nauri Simmonds, executive director of Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic. Many of those adversely impacted by drilling stay silent for fear of losing work or social standing, she said — and some who have spoken out have faced threats and violence.
Simmonds says what might be lost by developing the refuge can’t be counted in dollars. AIDEA now holds leases in a part of the refuge where the Porcupine caribou herd gathers to bear its young. The Gwich’in name for the region, where cool coastal winds protect the newborns from insects and heat, translates to “the sacred place where life begins.” Beyond its shelter, calves are 19 percent more likely to die. Scientists and Indigenous peoples fear the clamor of development will drive the herd away, severing a bond that has sustained people and animals alike for millenia. Even as climate change reshapes one of the country’s last undisturbed ecosystems, it is political forces that now endanger it most.
“One of the most wounding pieces is that this wouldn’t be something that the companies would have gone after on their own,” Simmonds said. “It is the enticements from Alaska, from the corporations, from the political landscape, that creates the appeal.”

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
Youth homelessness has declined by nearly a quarter since 2019 in California, according to a new report that offers a bright spot amid the state’s ongoing struggle to bring people off the streets.
Last year’s homeless census counted about 9,900 unhoused Californians under age 24 — a 24% reduction from 2019, according to a report by John Burton Advocates for Youth. The number of young people sleeping on the street (not in a shelter) declined 42%.
That progress hasn’t been universal. Overall homelessness in California increased 24% during that time. Nationwide, youth homelessness increased 11%. 
So why are things getting better for young people in California?
More money, according to the report. Starting in the 2018-19 fiscal year, California launched a new homeless housing and services grant and reserved 5% of those funds for young people. By the 2021-22 fiscal year, the overall grant had reached $1 billion, of which 10% was dedicated to young people.
State funding cuts on the horizon threaten to derail California’s progress. The 2025-26 budget includes no new Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention funding (a cut that won’t be felt until next year, due to the delayed nature of the funding program). Legislators have proposed $500 million for the 2026-27 budget, which would be a 50% cut from last year’s budget.
Jovenes, Inc., which serves homeless young people in Southeast Los Angeles County, relies on that state money to fund its housing subsidy program, according to the report. Traditional homelessness programs tend to prioritize older people with disabilities and chronic illnesses who have lived on the street for a long time, which can make it hard for young people to get a bed. 

Andrea Marchetti, executive director of Jovenes: “That’s 219 slots going away. The bottom line is that there’s already not much out there for (transition-aged youth), and if the funding is not renewed, we’re leaving thousands of young people without support.”

Newsom’s former chief of staff indicted

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff was indicted Wednesday on multiple counts of fraud, allegedly committed during her time working for the governor, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Dana Williamson, along with three co-conspirators, were indicted as “the result of three years of relentless investigative work,” said FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel, in a statement.
The indictment alleges that from 2022 to 2024, Williamson worked with a Sacramento lobbyist; Sean McCluskie, the former chief of staff to former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra; and two other unnamed co-conspirators to funnel away $225,000 from a dormant Becerra campaign account to McCluskie for personal use.
The indictment also accuses Williamson of claiming more than $1.7 million in false tax returns, which she used to buy luxury handbags, chartered jets and more.
Becerra, who is running for governor in 2026, said Wednesday that he did not know about the scheme and that he is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Newsom’s office is distancing the governor from Williamson.

Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson: “While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity.”

AT&T continues quest to abandon landlines

With parts of California experiencing frequent mudslides, floods and other natural disasters, the ability to reliably contact emergency services remains vital for residents. But for years AT&T has been trying to retire its copper landline service and bow out of its legal obligation to be the state’s “carrier of last resort,” report CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and Malena Carollo.
AT&T provides 75% of the state’s last-resort phone service, covering about 500,000 Californians. This year, it poured at least $4.5 million to pass a bill, which ultimately stalled, that would have allowed it to cut its copper services in certain areas of the state in exchange for agreeing to expand its fiber services.
It costs AT&T at least a billion dollars a year to maintain landline service in California, and state and federal subsidies for doing so have waned in recent decades. Still, the company is in the black, with $9.7 billion in reported profits so far this year. 
But critics say landline alternatives have their drawbacks: Fiber optic lines require backup power, and cellphone services aren’t as reliable. They also argue that AT&T wants to line shareholders’ pockets at the expense of communities that rely on landlines during emergencies. More than one million 911 calls in California are made each year over landlines.

Mayor Karen Bass' runs for re-election, will Austin Beutner, former L.A. schools chief, developer Rick Caruso or President Trump be factors?","The announcement by investment banker and former schools chief Austin Beutner that he will challenge Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for re-election poses several questions about the state of politics in America’s second-largest city.
Among them: Is Bass vulnerable to a respectable opponent? If so, what kind of challenger might give her the most trouble? And how, if at all, does the long shadow of President Donald Trump affect the parameters of this race?
Let’s take those in order:
Yes, Bass is vulnerable. Public and private polls place her approval rating somewhere in the low 40s, against a disapproval rating in the high 40s — which means she’s about 10 points under water, a danger zone for an incumbent. 
The good news for her is that her disapproval hasn’t risen above 50% in any poll, so she hasn’t alienated a majority of voters. 
It also bears noting that her standing comes at a time when many political figures are held in low esteem. 
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom typically tops 50% since he stepped up his attacks on Trump. The president, for point of reference, is deeply unpopular, with disapprovals outweighing approvals by 18% — shocking even for a leader who generally receives low marks from Americans. 
Bass’ numbers are nowhere near alarming enough to count her out, but they do invite challengers. For months, speculation has mostly centered around businessman Rick Caruso, who Bass beat in 2022. If Caruso gets in, it will set up a rematch of a race in which he spent more than $100 million of his own money, only to lose to Bass by 10 points. 
Private polling has shown Caruso potentially starting off a bit better this time, but not by much. Many voters don’t like that he’s a developer or that he registered as a Democrat just in time to run in 2022.

Even Caruso’s attempts to challenge Bass over her response to the January wildfires were complicated by his record during that devastating event. Caruso’s private fire crews protected his mall in the Palisades while allowing structures around them to burn — not a great look for a would-be mayor for all Angelenos.
Beutner’s main contribution to the campaign so far may be to crowd out Caruso. It’s hard to imagine there’s room in a Los Angeles election for two rich white guys. Indeed, there’s reason to wonder whether there’s even room for one. And with Senator Alex Padilla’s announcement last week that he won’t run for governor, Caruso may have a better opening in that race. 
As the campaign moves forward, a look at the issues and personalities will help voters make up their minds in this race, but for now, the questions are more structural than personal. 
Which brings us to this one: What kind of challenger might pose the biggest threat to Bass?
People outside Los Angeles undoubtedly imagine that a liberal, Black woman mayor would be vulnerable only to a conservative, someone who could hold the center while she drew support from the left. 
Those people would be wrong.
Los Angeles is among the most liberal cities in America. If anything, Bass may be more conservative than the city’s political center. Given that, there’s been talk of possible liberal challengers to her. The popularity of Democratic Socialists in several council districts and New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s recent victory are reminders that the left has a solid and growing hold in America’s urban centers.

For his part, Beutner resists attempts to categorize his candidacy as fitting into one lane or another. In an interview last week he emphasized he is seeking the office in response to what he senses as broad disappointment in Bass’ leadership. 
He’s arguing for an all-out commitment to building more housing, an issue that might put him to Bass’ left. To liberal housing advocates he offers a construction boom and, one hopes, a burst in supply that might bring down rents. 
But he also talks about improving public safety, security and cleanliness, issues that might appeal to more conservative voters.  
That’s going to take some footwork, but Beutner, a former superintendent of Los Angeles public schools, is not to be taken lightly. (Disclosure: I worked as an editorial page editor at the L.A. Times when Beutner was its publisher in 2014-15.)
One recent private poll found just 23% of those interviewed had an impression of Beutner. Coaxed by a description of him as a “Democrat who gets things done” and given a few other tidbits from his resume, they broke in his direction, suggesting a  possible campaign path. However, they did so when fed a positive description of him and his achievements. That’s a favor the Bass campaign will not grant him.
Which brings us to the final question: How is this campaign affected by Trump?
The mayor’s race will appear on the ballot next June and, if no candidate gets a majority in that round, the runoff will be in November. That places it in competition with the Congressional midterms — hotly contested races sure to place Trump in the center of the conversation.
That, too, probably helps Bass, because Trump has made it clear he doesn’t respect the mayor. And the electorate in Los Angeles has made it just as clear that it has no use for him.
Ever since ICE began waging its theatrical and overbearing raids in Los Angeles last summer, Bass has risen to oppose the president, challenging him in court and in public appearances. 
For his part, Trump has called Los Angeles a “trash heap” and disparaged Bass as being “not very competent.” And Stephen Miller, Trump’s architect of the ICE raids, has accused Bass of siding with the “illegal alien invasion” of California. 
In normal times, a mayor might suffer under such withering criticism from Washington. But as much as Trump nationalizes this campaign, he helps Bass; he’s not hurting her. 
The recent vote on Proposition 50 — which authorized redistricting California Congressional seats to counter Texas’ efforts to help Trump in the midterms — shows more than 64% of Californians supporting it.
That’s a big number. But in Los Angeles, the yes vote was 74%, a staggering majority and entirely dedicated to thwarting Trump. As those numbers prove, voters here detest Trump. He has a way of crowding out other conversations. 
If Los Angeles sees Bass as a bulwark against the president, it may be hard for Beutner, or any other candidate, to find traction — especially if they appear on the same ballot voters will use to register unhappiness with a president they loathe.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111225-Karen-Bass-Palisades-TS-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660

Its inclusion follows years of pressure from states and the marijuana industry.
While states continue to expand access to legal marijuana, a separate market of hemp-derived intoxicants has blossomed. The products, from drinks to gummies, are sold in gas stations and smoke shops. Critics say some companies have exploited a legal loophole from 2018 to manufacture products that get people high — without the safety regulations and taxes facing the legal marijuana industry.
That’s led dozens of states (including Connecticut) to limit or ban certain intoxicating hemp products. Most states also have pushed for federal changes, though some farm states worry the pending federal bill — which the House is expected to vote on as soon as today — goes too far.
[RELATED: CT House votes to set standards on THC products]
A bipartisan group of 39 state attorneys general recently urged Congress to clarify the federal definition of hemp, arguing that the underregulated industry threatens public health and undermines law enforcement.
Texas lawmakers this year approved a strict ban on intoxicating hemp, but that measure was vetoed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor raised constitutional concerns because federal law allowed the products, but he then issued an executive order increasing state agency regulations, including age restrictions.
This summer, Florida regulators seized tens of thousands of packages of hemp products that failed to meet new child protection standards, including child-resistant packaging, marketing restrictions and enhanced labeling rules. In Tallahassee, the state Senate approved a ban on hemp-derived THC products, including beverages, but that measure died in the state House. A similar effort last year was vetoed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said it would harm small businesses.
Last month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation strengthening state enforcement of its ban on intoxicating hemp products. Similarly, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine declared an emergency last month in an executive order banning intoxicating hemp products for 90 days while lawmakers debate potential legislation.
Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. The 39 state attorneys general argue manufacturers are manipulating hemp to produce synthetic THC that can be more intoxicating than marijuana.
“In this way, legal, nonintoxicating hemp is used to make Frankenstein THC products that get adults high and harm and even kill children,” the attorneys general wrote.
Hemp-derived gummies and beverages are sold without consistent age restrictions or labeling regulations and oftentimes resemble candy. During his announcement, DeWine showcased brightly packaged intoxicating hemp products that resembled name-brand candy products.
“Certainly, it’s easy to see how a child will confuse this product with real candy and eat a few gummy bears and ingest enough THC to require hospitalization,” he said, according to the Ohio Capital Journal.
Though it has faced mounting restrictions in the states, the hemp industry says the federal change poses an existential threat.
On Monday, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable said the legislation pending in Congress would wipe out 95% of the nation’s $28.4 billion hemp industry.
“The language will force patients, seniors and veterans who rely on hemp products to break federal criminal law to acquire them,” the trade group posted online.
Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the organization, said the industry has been pushing for regulation rather than outright prohibition. He acknowledged the problem of bad actors, but said those can be addressed with strong regulations like those that exist in Kentucky and Minnesota.
“These are good examples of states that have put together robust regulations. But we need to see that at the federal level, and we’ve been supporting legislation to do that for the last seven years,” he told Stateline.
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s senior senator, said he included the hemp measure in the bill to close an unintended legal loophole and that the measure would still allow farmers to grow hemp for fiber, oil and drug trials.
But fellow Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said the move would “eradicate the hemp industry” and could override some state laws. Paul offered an amendment to remove the hemp provision but failed.
The hemp loophole
Hemp derives from the same cannabis species as marijuana, but is legally defined by its lower levels of THC, the psychoactive component of the plant.
While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Congress sanctioned hemp in the 2018 farm bill to allow an agricultural market for hemp-based textiles, animal feeds and human wellness products centered on cannabidiol, or CBD, products. The farm bill allowed cultivation of hemp plants with a THC concentration of 0.3% or lower by dry weight.
But that threshold has become essentially meaningless, said Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.
That’s because manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Aside from the potential of creating very strong products, she said the process requires the addition of solvents and other ingredients that raise many safety questions.
“With marijuana products, you can get some very potent products,” she said. “But the psychoactive components to THC are naturally occurring. It naturally occurs in that natural amount. You’re not doing a whole bunch of manipulation to increase the potency of the product and adding ingredients.”
Harris has tracked the growing number of states regulating the industry: Six states and the District of Columbia now ban all consumable hemp products with any amount of THC. In 24 states, intoxicating hemp products are permitted, though 15 of those states allow only low-potency products.
But even states with strict regulations still must contend with legal online markets.
“There’s a big part of that activity that you can’t control as a state when something is federally legal, and so that’s one thing that they’re asking for is federal leadership on this issue,” she said. “I think there is a big demand for some sort of industry standards.”
If approved by Congress and signed by the president, as expected, the new hemp legislation will likely have uneven impacts across the states.
For example, the change likely won’t dramatically alter the legal landscape in Alaska, where the regulators have banned all intoxicating hemp products. Marijuana businesses complain those products are still being sold, despite the ban.
But in a state like Nebraska, where lawmakers have been unsuccessful in limiting intoxicating hemp, the change could drastically alter both consumer access and business sales, depending on enforcement.
On Monday, Paul said the federal legislation would wipe away hemp regulations in many states, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine and Utah.
“The bill before us nullifies all these state laws,” he said.
‘Running with knives’
The hemp industry has argued that a lot of the opposition to it stems from marijuana businesses looking to protect their own markets, noting that campaigns for restrictions are often more organized in states that have legalized marijuana.
But producers of intoxicating hemp are looking for market access without the associated safety regulations and tax structures states have created for marijuana, argued Chris Lindsey, the director of state advocacy and public policy at the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp, an organization representing the legal marijuana industry.
“They want to have some kind of regulatory framework that’s somehow different than the one that states already have [for marijuana],” he said.
His organization cheered the Senate’s efforts “to address the dangerous proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products.”
Lindsey said hemp-derived products can contain contaminants, including pesticides. Many hemp products can be sourced cheaply overseas, he said, and with lax oversight, there is no system to recall tainted products here.
“To me, that’s like running with knives,” he told Stateline.
The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association recently purchased hemp products from gas stations and smoke shops from across the state to test them in an effort to show they need more regulation.
In its “Missouri Hemp Hoax Report,” the organization said independent testing found 53 of the 55 products purchased were actually intoxicating marijuana well above the legal limit of THC. Third-party lab results also showed some of the products contained pesticides and heavy metals.
Those results underscore that the products should face the same rules as legal marijuana does, said Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the cannabis trade association. State law requires marijuana to be grown and manufactured in Missouri, mandates lab testing and allows for sales only at licensed dispensaries.
“In my mind, if it’s marijuana, which most of this is, then it should be regulated like marijuana,” Mullins said.
He said calling the unregulated products “hemp” is akin to someone selling whiskey and calling it corn: “Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.”
Mullins acknowledged the confusion among policymakers and law enforcement. But he said there are already laws — including those against trafficking marijuana without a license — that could help address the issue.
Catherine Hanaway, a Republican who was sworn in as Missouri’s new attorney general in September, has vowed action on unregulated hemp products, particularly THC beverages that are booming in popularity.
“Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,” James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff, told the Missouri Independent last month. “This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it’s particularly detrimental.”

AT&T’s failed effort this year to retire copper landlines in parts of California seemed to have support from a diverse grassroots coalition. But many of the members had ties with the telecom giant, CalMatters found.




Upon hearing her husband’s call for help, Cynthia Halliday came flying upstairs. He was rushing toward the outdoor deck, gasping for air. He was having a heart attack.
Halliday held him and dialed 911 with her cellphone. The dispatcher answered, but within seconds, she said, the call disconnected due to poor reception. Halliday screamed for help, loud enough for her next-door neighbor Larry Williams to hear and dial from his copper landline. This time, it got through.
Halliday’s husband did not survive. But on that day in 2018, Halliday became convinced that copper landlines were her best shot at getting help during emergencies, especially where she lives in Hacienda, a tight-knit community deep in the rural forests of Northern California. 
Those landlines, however, are what AT&T — the largest copper landline provider in California — is pushing to retire nationwide. 
As California’s largest “carrier of last resort,” AT&T is required by law to provide basic phone service, typically copper landlines, to any Californian who asks for it, with lower-income customers qualifying for a discount. It provides 75% of the state’s last-resort phone service, accounting for about 500,000 Californians and 5% of all its California customers.
Subsidies to support copper landlines have declined sharply. Critics say AT&T wants to shed them to avoid their billion-dollar annual cost  and boost profits with lucrative services like fiber.
For the past two years, AT&T has tried unsuccessfully to bow out of that obligation in many areas of the state, spending heavily to influence state regulations and laws. This year, it spent at least $4.5 million on lobbying as it tried and failed to pass a bill that would have allowed AT&T to cut copper services in certain areas in exchange for agreeing to expand its fiber services. Its industry ally, USTelecom, assembled a “grassroots” coalition to support the legislation, with more than 80% of coalition members having ties to AT&T, CalMatters found.
The company’s efforts to shed copper landlines show no signs of stopping. An ongoing process by the utilities regulators seeks to determine key components of the carrier of last resort requirements. And Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, an Inglewood Democrat, told CalMatters she intends to revive the bill that died this year.
It’s unclear just how many Californians would be impacted if AT&T gets its way. A map AT&T submitted to California utilities regulators as part of a failed 2023 effort marked 1,133 towns across 53 of California’s counties, including rural communities such as Hacienda, as territories the company sought to withdraw from. 
AT&T said it only wants to pull out of communities with multiple alternatives, such as wireless and fixed broadband. It argued it’s not cost-effective to maintain expensive copper lines for many of its customers, the number of which has dwindled over the years. Doing away with the obligation would free up money to invest in more advanced technologies, such as fiber optics, it said. 
“No Californian will be left without reliable phone service in their homes, including 911 services,” said Terri Baca, vice president of legislative affairs at AT&T, at an April legislative hearing.
But critics say the reliability of those alternatives isn’t guaranteed, and that AT&T’s push would pad shareholders’ pockets at the expense of a lifeline for those communities, especially during power outages and natural disasters. Statewide, more than one million 911 calls are made each year over landlines, according to the state’s Office of Emergency Services. 
If AT&T’s goal is to upgrade services, it should build them out before retiring copper, opponents argue.
“If they wanted to replace copper with fiber right now, there’s nothing stopping them,” said Phil Grosse, a Hacienda resident and the North Coast regional chair of the California Democratic Party’s rural caucus.

The debate has intensified in California in recent years, partly because it is a significant holdout in AT&T’s plan to abandon copper networks across the country.
Spokespeople for USTelecom, its coalition Californians for a Connected Future, and AT&T did not specify how they recruited coalition members or why most members had ties to AT&T. Instead, they sent general statements calling the state’s carrier of last resort obligation archaic.
“Our goal is to deliver the best possible experience to our customers, now and into the future,” said Megan Ketterer of AT&T.
Cara Duckworth, a spokesperson for USTelecom, told CalMatters “even if we answered all the questions I’m not sure we’d get a fair shake.”
“Many of our providers would love to no longer have to spend money maintaining old copper equipment and would much rather invest that money in next (generation) networks that better serve consumers,” she said. 
Some rural Californians say they fear AT&T will eventually wear state lawmakers down to that goal.
“Rural communities don’t have the big money to compete with AT&T. That’s why we hire legislators to look out for us,” Grosse said in a June letter to state lawmakers.
‘Predictably unpredictable’
Kathy Yerger, 67, lives among redwoods so dense that wireless Internet providers have refused to service her Hacienda home. 
“It would be like trying to find a golf ball in the sky,” she remembered one provider telling her. Another, upon learning her address, chuckled and told her “no, you are not on the list,” she said.
Although she has a cellphone, Yerger has learned not to rely on it. 
“If I put the phone in the window and hope the stars line up and the trees don’t blow, yes I can (try to connect),” she said. “It’s predictably unpredictable.”
Like many of her neighbors, Yerger’s best — if not only — bet at communicating with the outside world is her copper landline. Even that line fails sometimes when water corrodes the old copper wires. But it’s still the most reliable option she has, especially during emergencies and natural disasters.

In Hacienda, frequent mudslides and floods during rainy winters have washed away homes, sparked power outages, and sometimes claimed lives. The 2020 Walbridge fire, which scorched more than 55,000 acres of Sonoma County, got within a quarter mile of Yerger’s house. The only notification was word of mouth from the local fire department deputies and a neighbor calling her landline, she said. 
Few reliable alternatives remain during those disasters. Cellphone services, which many Californians rely on to receive emergency alerts, can quickly fail. Fiber optic lines, while more resilient, require backup power along the network and are expensive to install. Voice-over-Internet-Protocol phones, a landline alternative, depend on the internet and home electricity and thus fail during power outages. 
The alternatives are so unreliable during emergencies that Hacienda residents created walking evacuation routes along the area’s ragged switchbacks. They set up their own walkie-talkie network, drilling weekly. They even discussed using bullhorns and sirens to alert each other if a wildfire comes through, Grosse said. The hope is to reach enough people for someone with a copper landline to call for help. 
“There’s no copper fetish here,” Grosse said. “When a reliable alternative appears, I’d really be happy to give (it) up.”
A technology upgrade or a profit grab?
Underlying AT&T’s push to retire copper is money. Telecom companies previously received subsidies from state and federal governments for last-resort services, but those payments have been reduced or eliminated in recent decades. California, for example, reduced its subsidy fund from $400 million in 1996 to about $20 million currently, according to a USTelecom regulatory filing. 
This leaves companies providing landlines with a larger share of the bill for maintaining such networks. For AT&T, that’s about $1 billion each year in California alone.Despite this, AT&T remains profitable. An October filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed a $9.7 billion profit so far this year. And fiber is one of its profit drivers, bringing in $2.2 billion, up nearly 17% from the same time last year.
“They’re looking for a way to boost profits,” said Ernesto Falcon, communications and broadband program manager for the California Public Advocates Office.“They can’t legally do that unless you get rid of (the carrier of last resort requirements).”
AT&T representatives have repeatedly insisted that the company’s efforts to pull out as a carrier of last resort are to modernize telecommunication. In public hearings, they promised that AT&T’s request would not threaten copper landlines in areas without other viable options. 
So far, state regulators and lawmakers aren’t convinced.

The California Public Utilities Commission rejected a March 2023 petition by AT&T that would have allowed it to pull out copper lines only in service areas where customers have telephone service alternatives. The application claimed 99.7% of its customers had access to at least three alternatives, with 99.9% having access to at least two.
After the rejection, the company turned to the state Legislature, sponsoring bills to relinquish its obligation. 
Last year, an AT&T-backed bill would have granted the company relief if it notified the commission of certain census blocks with no customers or with multiple phone service alternatives. The bill, authored by McKinnor, died without a hearing.
McKinnor reintroduced the measure as Assembly Bill 470 this spring. In its final form, the bill would have allowed AT&T to pull copper lines out of open spaces and “well served” areas — those with at least three other service providers — if it promised, among other requirements, to expand advanced fiber optics in six years to three times as many households as it is currently required to serve and to help its customers transition to other services. 
The bill would have required the public utilities commission to map out well-served areas using the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map and the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program — both tools to measure internet, not telephone, connectivity. The map was criticized by opponents of the bill, including the California Public Advocate’s Office, as not being an accurate representation of coverage.
“This bill does not leave any customer behind. This isn’t about taking something away, it’s about ensuring that we have a plan to migrate Californians to superior services,” Baca said in a July hearing.
McKinnor told CalMatters the measure was her “out of the box, progressive” way to get AT&T to pay for infrastructure upgrades instead of spending taxpayer dollars.

But critics say some areas, such as Hacienda, could count as well served while still lacking quality access. There’s no guarantee that other providers would offer reliable alternatives, and the legislation would not have required the fiber buildout to be in the same communities where AT&T seeks to pull out, they said. Many Hacienda households are listed on the federal broadband map as having four internet providers available — none of which are reliable, they said.
“I agree we need to have technology, but only to a point where you are not dropping service for people that are dependent on it,” said Kelli Mathia, immediate past president of the Odd Fellows Recreation Club in Guerneville, down the Russian River from Hacienda.
If AT&T is really trying to upgrade services, why must they pull out copper lines first? Halliday wondered. 
But McKinnor said allowing AT&T to  preemptively pull the lines is only fair.
“I believe in free enterprise,” she told CalMatters. “I can’t mandate a business to spend billions of dollars doing infrastructure and say, ‘Oh, maybe we will give you (the relief) at the end.’”
AT&T’s real goal is to boost its bottom line, said Regina Costa, a Hacienda resident and telecom policy director for The Utility Reform Network, which led opposition to the bill.
“What they really want is to get rid of customers that they do not think are profitable,” she said.
In a shareholder meeting last year, AT&T CEO John Stankey said getting customers off of copper lines allowed the company to “turn down” that service in “low utilization” and “low profitable” territories. “I can turn out the lights, walk away, take cost out of business,” he said.
AT&T’s web of connections
AT&T is already a political juggernaut in Sacramento.
Between 2015 and 2024, AT&T made nearly $3 million in campaign contributions to state lawmakers, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. This year, it contributed nearly $300,000 to lawmakers’ campaign accounts as they considered its sponsored legislation, data from the California secretary of state’s office shows. 
AT&T also reported giving five California lawmakers and two of their staffers $300 tickets to Mexican singer Ana Gabriel’s Sacramento concert on the day the bill died in the Senate Appropriations Committee. The five, all Democrats, were Sen. Susan Rubio of West Covina and Assemblymembers Mark Gonzalez, of Los Angeles; José Solache, of Lakewood; Juan Carrillo, of Palmdale; and Blanca Rubio, of West Covina. All voted for AB 470 this year, with Assemblymember Rubio voting for early iterations of the bill but not casting a floor vote. 
Spokespeople for all five lawmakers told CalMatters that AT&T’s gifts did not sway their decision and that they supported the bill on merit. 
The company spent another $4 million lobbying state lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration about the bill this year, including $2 million spent between April and June, making it the company’s most expensive lobbying quarter in California in 20 years. It spent an additional $354,000 lobbying the utilities commission to influence the state’s carrier of last resort rules and policies around telephone companies’ service quality standards.
AT&T is so powerful in Sacramento, Grosse said, that some legislative aides told him in the past he would not win in a fight against the company. 
“The (party’s) rural caucus can go ahead and they can talk to legislators, but AT&T is spending so much money on elections you are not going to prevail,” he recalled being told. 
On its face, AB 470 had widespread support this year from Californians for a Connected Future, a recently formed coalition of more than 150 disability advocates, chambers of commerce, tribes, community service organizations, local officials and small businesses, including a construction company and a tennis shop. For months, dozens of those groups testified in public hearings and signed identical letters urging lawmakers to pass the bill, arguing it would incentivize modern technologies and ensure more reliable coverage. 
The coalition, which describes itself as “grassroots,” also states it is a “project of USTelecom.” Rhonda Johnson, AT&T’s executive vice president of federal regulatory relations, sits on the trade group’s board. USTelecom received $250,000 from AT&T to lobby on its behalf this year, and also spent between $85,200 and $106,000 running ads on Facebook supporting the bill in the coalition’s name, according to a CalMatters tally. 
It’s a prevalent practice commonly known as “astroturfing,” when corporations or trade groups enlist seemingly unaffiliated organizations for the appearance of grassroots support, said Jack Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. 
“If you don’t read the fine print, you’ll assume that … there are a lot of organizations that sincerely support this legislation.”

While the coalition often bragged about the scale and diversity of its membership, more than 80% of member organizations have ties to AT&T, CalMatters found. 
Some of those groups have AT&T’s top leaders serving on their board of directors. That includes AT&T president Susan Santana, who sits on the board of the California Chamber of Commerce. Ben Golombek, the chamber’s chief of staff for policy, most recently served as the west region vice president for public affairs for AT&T. Other AT&T executives, mostly directors of external affairs, double as board members of various local chambers, business groups, foundations and voting rights groups. 
AT&T also pays to be a member of many local chambers of commerce, many of whom support the bill. Of the 28 chambers in support, AT&T is listed as a corporate member of 26 of them. 
Dozens of coalition members list AT&T as a key funder. The California Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce calls AT&T an “invaluable” partner. Groups such as the Concerned Black Men of Los Angeles, which provides mentorship to Black local residents, list the company as a sponsor. 
Others, including tribes, youth service groups and senior advocates, have partnered with the company in its $5 billion effort to “bridge the digital divide” nationwide, distributing free laptops donated by AT&T,  hosting “connected learning centers” the company set up across the state to offer free digital access or receiving grants from AT&T to address digital inequity. 
The telecom giant has also sponsored events for some coalition members, from golf tournaments for the San Gabriel Valley Conservation Corps to the 70th anniversary gala of Society for the Blind. 
The financial support can make it hard not to align with AT&T, Pitney said.
“If AT&T has supported you in a material way, you want to make sure that support continues,” he said. “You are likely to look favorably on requests from that organization.”

CalMatters reached out to all organizations and people named in this story for comment. Most did not respond. California Chamber of Commerce spokesperson John Myers said it supported the bill because it made “economic sense.” Lauren Oto, a spokesperson for the California Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce, said the group supported the AT&T-backed bill because “it represents a key opportunity for our members to see that technology is being used to improve public safety and expand access to communication.”
Norma Quiñones, executive director of the San Gabriel Valley nonprofit, told CalMatters AT&T’s sponsorship had nothing to do with the group’s support for the legislation. But the nonprofit offers job training to youths, she said, and AT&T is a prospective employer. While acknowledging not knowing much about the bill, she said it would help close the digital divide and expand high-speed internet access to underserved communities like the ones she serves.
“I wanted to build the relationship with AT&T and support their efforts,” she said. “It ultimately ties into our workforce development and our digital equity goals for our young people.”
The sway AT&T has worries residents like Grosse. 
“One of the largest corporations in the world spent (millions of) dollars lobbying on this thing,” he said. “Do you really think it’s in the public’s interest?”
Regulatory change on the horizon?
If potential legislation doesn’t beat them to it, California utility regulators are expected to decide the future of California’s carrier of last resort obligations over the coming months. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is currently undertaking a rulemaking process that seeks to answer questions including who should be providing last resort service, what would count as sufficient coverage and under what circumstances companies could stop doing so.
USTelecom and AT&T have advocated for changing the requirement so AT&T can stop providing this service in all but “populated areas,” and eventually leave those as well.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Community College System (ACCS) will push for raises for instructors in the FY 2027 budget, ACCS Chancellor Jimmy Baker said Wednesday.
Speaking after an ACCS Board of Trustees meeting, Baker said the pay gap between college instructors and K-12 teachers has caused “several hundred” professors state-wide to go and work for high schools.
“We have people here who are, say, teaching machining and students graduate with a certification in machining and go out and make more than the person that was teaching. And on top of that, we’re losing instructors to some of the high schools because of the pay scale,” he said.

According to the ACCS salary schedule for the current school year, D-2 community college instructors in Alabama with no experience in the lowest rank for a nine-month contract make $39,702 per year. 
The salary schedule for the Alabama State Department of Education for the current school year says entry-level K-12 employees with bachelor’s degrees make $47,600 a year.
In order to close the gap, Baker said there will be a concentrated effort to enhance communications between community college presidents, ACCS employees, community members and legislators. 
“What we typically will be doing is keeping all of our presidents aware of what we are trying and wanting to do, then they will be responsible for talking to their local legislators. Then when it gets to the budget committee there will be support there for that,” Baker said.
All funding decisions are in the hands of the Alabama Legislature, which will begin the 2026 session and work on the 2027 budgets on Jan. 13. 
Alan Bates, special assistant to the chancellor, said during a meeting Wednesday ACCS is working to shrink the pay gap.
“[Other education providers across the state] have been able to outpace at times what we have been able to pay our instructors for some of the same quality, some of the same credentialing, and what they’re certified to teach,” he said to the Board of Trustees. “And so you’re looking at anywhere from a $15,000 to $20,000 disparity at times that we’re going to be trying to, over the course of several years, try to decrease that gap, if nothing else.”
ACCS is budgeted to receive $622.2 million from the Education Trust Fund in fiscal year 2026, which began on Oct. 1. 
Baker said work to begin the process of increasing employee pay began last year and that he doesn’t anticipate any issues with securing the funds to help pay community college instructors more.
“[Legislators] will look at the available funds, and they’ll be restricted by that, but I’ve not encountered anyone that doesn’t understand the need to accommodate some method of trying to move the pay scale to an acceptable level,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/March-7-budget-presentation-06-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660
,California,2025-11-13 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California is a high-tax state. Are more taxes a balm for its budget deficits?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/california-high-taxes-budget-deficit/,California ranks near the top in tax rates but still has structural deficits in its budget. Legislators would rather tax more than cut costs.,"California has long had the reputation — backed by copious data — of being a high-tax state, which made Gov. Gavin Newsom’s declaration last June, in a prerecorded State of the State address, a bit startling.
“Here’s the truth Republicans never tell you: California is not a high-tax state,” Newsom said.
Later he clarified his assertion, saying California’s taxes on low-income residents are relatively lower than those in red states.
“Catering to big business and the rich is also why red states tax their lowest earners far more than California does. They punish you when you’re struggling, but give you a free pass when you’re wealthy,” the governor said.
There’s some truth to that. California’s very progressive income tax system, with the nation’s highest marginal rate of 13.3%, makes its state budget highly dependent on taxing incomes of its wealthiest residents, while those in low- and moderate-income brackets pay little or no income taxes.
Nevertheless,  taxes imposed by state and local governments put California in the highest ranks of the 50 states, not only in total — more than $400 billion a year from all sources — but in per capita terms — more than $10,000 each — and as a percentage of its $3.6 trillion in total personal income.
The Washington-based Tax Foundation ranks Californians’ state and local tax burden 48th, one of the highest in the nation, out-taxed only by New York and New Jersey. 
“California combines high tax rates with an uncompetitive tax structure, yielding one of the worst rankings on the Index,” the Tax Foundation says.
The state’s $322 billion 2025-26 budget counts on $297 billion from about a dozen different taxes, while cities, counties, school districts and other local agencies take in another $100 billion or so, primarily from property taxes and local shares of the sales tax.
The budget anticipates $207 billion in general fund revenues. So far revenue is running a bit ahead, but general fund spending is budgeted at $226 billion. Maneuvers to cover the gap include shifting $7.1 billion from emergency reserves, pushing the June 2026 state payroll into the following fiscal year and tapping special funds for loans.
State budget experts call it a “structural deficit” that will continue indefinitely in the absence of either sharp spending reductions or tax increases.
There’s little appetite for the former in a Legislature dominated by Democrats but some support for the latter. The California Taxpayers Association recently reported that legislators proposed more than $16 billion in new taxes and fees during the recently concluded 2025 session.
The battle over taxes appears to be headed for the 2026 ballot, with two pro-taxation measures being pushed by public employee unions and other left-leaning groups and one that would create a new hurdle for local tax increases.
One proposal, backed by the California Teachers Association, would make permanent a temporary tax increase on high-income Californians, first approved in 2012 to close a budget deficit and later extended to 2030 via a ballot measure. All of its revenue, as much as $15 billion a year, would go to K-12 schools and community colleges.
A second measure, sponsored mainly by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, would impose a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of California’s billionaires, raising about $100 billion, which would be spent at the rate of $25 billion a year to cover the state’s structural deficit and prop up health care services.
The third, sponsored by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, would overturn a state Supreme Court ruling and re-impose a two-thirds voter approval requirement on all proposed local taxes designated for particular purposes.

	During the special legislative session which starts this week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is asking lawmakers to do what they didn’t during the regular session earlier this year: pass a crime bill he backed.
Lombardo brought the “Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act,” which sought to enact multiple measures to toughen penalties and broaden the scope of crime infractions on the books, during the recent legislative session. 
Despite receiving backing from Democratic lawmakers, the ranging bill barely missed a midnight deadline the first time around as the regular legislative session was winding down in June.
That iteration of the bill targeted “smash and grab crimes,” called for stricter DUI penalties, and aimed to heighten law enforcement in the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor.
Using a special session to pass laws on tougher crimes is not only aggressive but a “waste of money,” said Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada. 
“We don’t believe that a special session should be called to add on new crimes when it often seems the only thing the state can do is pass tough criminal law,” he said.
Lombardo, who ran for governor in 2022 while he was serving as Clark County sheriff, introduced his crime bill, Senate Bill 457, in April, but it didn’t receive a hearing until the last four days of the session. 
New language included a sweeping amendment that had significant changes from the original bill, including provisions that would more harshly prosecute crimes within the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor – a measure requested by the Nevada Resort Association. The bill would have also included language to re-establish a controversial specialty court to prosecute crimes within the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor.
In the final hours of the session, the state Senate and Assembly passed slightly different versions of SB 457 with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Senate was forced to adjourn before it could take a second vote to approve the last-minute amendments added by the Assembly.
Similar  provisions are likely to make a reappearance during the special session set to start Thursday, say advocates who opposed the bill earlier this year.
The Nevada Retail Association recently held a press conference urging Lombardo and state lawmakers to include harsher penalties for retail crime that were included in the final version of the bill that failed in June.
“Retail crime is an employee safety issue, it’s an economic development issue, it’s a tax revenue issue,” said Bryan Wachter, president of the Nevada Retail Association. “There was a provision that added additional penalties for destruction of property during the commission of these crimes. And we strongly urge the governor and policymakers to make sure that during the special session that that’s included on the agenda.”
The final version of the crime bill lawmakers attempted to pass earlier this year included harsher punishments for people charged with repeated felony DUIs, stalking and possession of child pornography.
It also called for stricter punishment for youth who commit repeated crimes against teachers or social service workers, while also limiting eligibility for diversion programs for those convicted of felony abuse, neglect or exploitation of children or the elderly.
The bill was criticized for its hefty price tag. If passed, the Nevada Department of Corrections estimated it would increase costs by $3.6 million in the current biennium, by just under $7.2 million for the next biennium, and by $42.2 million in future biennium, according to a fiscal note.
Advocates also say the crime bill risked turning back the clock on modest reforms passed by lawmakers with bipartisan support in 2019. 
Opponents of the bill also questioned the need for more crime laws amid a reduction in overall crime.
On his campaign reelection website, Lombardo has highlighted a 10% drop in violent crime – including a 9% fewer murders, 26% less robberies, and 15% less burglaries – since he took office. 
Lombardo’s efforts to be “tough on crime” is less about public safety but “influenced by the interests of Nevada’s powerful resort and gaming industries,” said Shelbie Swartz, executive director of Battle Born Progress.
“The tough-on-crime approach has been repeatedly discredited for its ineffectiveness and failure to produce meaningful outcomes,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/lombardo-dana-photo-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) As Democrats aim to build on the victories seen throughout the country in Nov. 4 elections, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee has highlighted the upcoming Dec. 30 special election for Iowa Senate District 16 as a top priority.
The DLCC, national Democrats’ campaign arm focused on state legislatures, announced Thursday that Democratic nominee Renee Hardman, running to take the Iowa Senate seat, was a “Spotlight candidate” ahead of the election.
Hardman, a West Des Moines councilwoman and president and CEO of Lutheran Services in Iowa, was selected as the Democrats’ nominee for the seat Oct. 23. Lucas Loftin, an employee of Wright Service Corp. in West Des Moines who serves on the boards of In His Light ministries and Homeschool Iowa, was nominated as the Republican candidate for the seat earlier this month.

The Dec. 30 special election is to fill the seat previously held by Iowa Sen. Claire Celsi, a Democrat, who died Oct. 6 after battling an undisclosed illness. The district is made up of parts of Polk and Dallas counties, including portions of West Des Moines, Clive and Windsor Heights. Celsi had won reelection in 2024 with 70% of the vote against Libertarian challenger Joshua Smith.
DLCC President Heather Williams said in a statement Hardman winning the race would have a major impact on Iowa.
“Iowa Senate Democrats shattered expectations when they broke the GOP supermajority by flipping two seats earlier this year,” Williams said. “Renee’s race is an opportunity to make history by electing the first Black woman to the state Senate chamber, while also defending Democrats’ gains. The 2025 elections proved that voters across the country are holding Republicans accountable for the affordability crisis, and the DLCC is proud to support Renee as we elect more state Democrats to fight for working families.”
The special election will determine whether Iowa Senate Republicans regain their supermajority, lost in August when Democrat Catelin Drey won the special election for Iowa Senate District 1.
Drey flipped the seat formerly held by Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton. Drey’s victory was the latest in a string of Democratic wins for state legislative seats in Iowa, as Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, won a January special election to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer as she joined Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration, and Rep. Angelina Ramirez, D-Cedar Rapids, won a special election in the Iowa House for the seat held by Democrat Rep. Sami Scheetz.
Rep. Blaine Watkins, R-Donnellson, was the only Republican to win a special election in the state this year in March for Iowa House District 100.
The election comes following major Democratic wins in 2025 elections throughout the country earlier in November, notably in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as Zohran Mamdani’s win in the New York City mayoral race.
There is one other special election coming up in Iowa before the Senate District 16 election. On Dec. 7,  Iowans in state House District 7 — covering Calhoun, Pocahontas, and Sac counties, as well as a part of Webster County — will vote to fill the Iowa House seat left vacant by Republican Rep. Mike Sexton, who took a position in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Republican Wendy Larson and Democrat Rachel Burns, both from Odebolt, are their respective party nominees for the House special election.

Vaughn RMC is one of 50 rural hospitals that are eligible to receive funds through the Rural Hospital Investment Program. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A state board overseeing aid to rural hospitals Wednesday approved applications from 50 hospitals and decided how undesignated funds would be allocated.
The Rural Hospital Investment Program Board was created through legislation that passed this spring. It created a dollar-for-dollar tax incentive program for individuals and businesses that donate to rural hospitals. It has an annual statewide cap of $20 million for 2026, $25 million for 2027 and $30 million for 2028 and beyond. It requires a 10% match from local communities.
The board unanimously approved all but one hospital that applied to receive funds. Stephen McCormick, vice president of government relations and workforce development for the Alabama Hospital Association, said that Beacon Children’s Hospital in Luverne does not meet the definition of “rural hospital” set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

“It’s a behavioral Hospital in Luverne providing mental health services for adolescents. It’s a wonderful facility,” McCormick said. “I just need to look at the definition to make sure and see their licensing structure to make that determination to the board.”
Beacon may still be approved before a Dec. 1 deadline for the board to publish a list of eligible hospitals, as required by law. Rob Pearson, chair of the board, said that there were two other hospitals that did not submit applications that the board may still consider before the deadline. 
Alabama’s rural hospitals will also be receiving funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Gov. Kay Ivey’s office announced that the state submitted its application to the federal government last week. 
The board also unanimously approved a tiered system for allocation of undesignated funds, which are donations that individuals or businesses make without choosing a specific hospital. There will be five tiers with 10 hospitals in each, with the first being hospitals with the highest need. If more than 50 hospitals qualify, the excess will fall in the bottom tier.
Tier One will get 30% of undesignated funds, split between the 10 hospitals. Tier Two will get 25%, Tier Three will get 20%, Tier Four will get 15% and Tier Five will get 10%, according to board member Dawn Bulgarella.
Alabama Hospital Association President Danne Howard said in an interview Wednesday that the hospitals that fall in Tier One will likely be those that did not receive direct donations. 
“Our hope, obviously, is that the undesignated funds will not be a lot, so that most people will make direct contributions to their hospitals,” she said. “So we’re hopeful that the bulk of the contributions won’t be in that undesignated category.”
While any sum of money that a hospital receives will not save it from closing, Howard said that was not the intention of the program. 
“It was never intended to be something that would prevent or save all of the rural hospitals, because it can’t, it won’t,” Howard said. “It is an opportunity for community engagement, for community support of their hospitals, to get some much needed cash into a rural hospital that has needs for something.”
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. Alabama is one of ten states that has not expanded Medicaid. Alabama’s hospitals have long pushed for expansion, saying it would help hospitals on the brink of collapse survive, but Republican leaders have resisted it.
While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
Howard said that the lack of Medicaid expansion relates to rural hospitals’ needs just as much as reimbursement rates, federal cuts to Medicaid and a high number of uninsured patients.
“It was a really good idea, a really good program to help rural hospitals struggling. It’s a tool in their toolbox to provide some financial support for them,” Howard said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12878-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 08:57:35.622660

More than a week after Election Day, results from the Wayne County community of Hamtramck remain in limbo because of dozens of ballots that weren’t counted — some of which may never be tallied.
Thirty-seven absentee ballots were not properly tabulated on election night due to what Hamtramck Deputy City Clerk Abe Siblani called “human error at the counting board.” He said the issue would be resolved during the county canvassing meeting at 1 p.m. Thursday. County officials did not immediately respond to questions Wednesday.
The outcome of the city’s mayoral election may depend on what happens.
It is unclear why the ballots weren’t counted. Mismatches between the number of ballots received and counted are rare, and usually stem from simple counting errors that are corrected before results are sent to the county.
Typically, only “cured” ballots — mail ballots with signature mismatches that have been reconciled — are added in during the canvassing process. Officials say there are potentially also a significant number of those, which could also affect the outcome of the mayoral election: The current margin stands at just 11 votes, with Adam Alharbi narrowly leading City Council member Muhith Mahmood.
Meanwhile, City Clerk Rana Faraj has been absent from the office. Siblani said that city officials told her not to come to work Monday and that he has not heard from her since. Faraj could not be reached for comment.
It’s not clear whether Faraj has been suspended in some way, or why she was told not to appear for work. City officials did not return multiple voicemails asking for information. She did, however, tell TV station WDIV that she “respectfully but firmly” disagreed with the city’s decision. Clerks are appointed by the city manager in Hamtramck, according to the city’s charter, and serve at the pleasure of the manager.
Faraj’s absence is the latest election mystery in Hamtramck, a city of about 28,000 people bordering Detroit that has been rocked by allegations that council members were involved in an election fraud scheme. An investigation into those allegations led to felony charges this year.
“We’re used to scandals at this point,” Siblani said.
In March, Faraj wrote a letter to Attorney General Dana Nessel, asking her office to “take action” on alleged election fraud in the city, saying that an unidentified City Council member — whom Faraj later confirmed to be Mohammed Hassan — “acts as though he’s above the law.”
Nessel later requested a special prosecutor to investigate Hassan, council members Abu Musa, Muhtasin Sadman, and Mohammed Alsomiri, as well as two others. The petition alleged they conspired to collect unvoted absentee ballots from newly naturalized citizens, fill them out, and pay for votes.
In August, Hassan and Sadman were charged with felonies. Felony charges against Sadman were later dropped after two subpoenaed witnesses failed to appear, The Detroit News reported last month, although he still faces a misdemeanor charge. Court records show Hassan is set to have a jury trial in April.
No others have been charged.
Despite the investigations, Musa and Nayeem Choudhury — who was one of the others named in Nessel’s petition — both won council seats last week, according to unofficial results. Just before the August primary, footage from surveillance cameras appeared to show Musa allegedly handing a driver bundles of ballots to place into a city drop box. Michigan State Police say they are investigating; Michigan law allows only family members or those in the same household to return ballots for voters.
The repeated irregularities have shaken some voters’ confidence in the city’s electoral processes. Several voters told Votebeat on Election Day that they felt charges of election crimes should disqualify a candidate.
Rich Lash, a Hamtramck voter, said he turned up to vote on Election Day despite the scandals because he felt it was his civic duty. He was voting for new people to “shake it up,” he told Votebeat, particularly after hearing from a number of family and friends that his vote wouldn’t matter.
“I’m pessimistically hopeful,” he said just a few hours before polls closed.

The obstacles we face are daunting and the outcomes are uncertain, but, to prevail, we must continually remember our collective power — and use it. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  James Lyall: People power can rebuild our democracy.","This commentary is by James Lyall, executive director at the ACLU of Vermont.


At this moment in our history, I’ve been reflecting on the famous words often attributed to Alice Walker: “The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.” 
Since taking office 10 months ago, the second Trump regime has sought to intimidate and coerce people into giving up their power, and in some instances it has succeeded.   
And yet, the collective power of individuals and communities to show up for one another, assert our rights and resist authoritarianism remains — and our efforts are making an impact every day, in courthouses, state houses and local communities across the country.  
The Trump administration was always going to face strong resistance in the courts, given its extreme disregard for the rule of law, and much of that litigation has been successful.   
True, the current Supreme Court in some cases has rubber stamped Trump’s abuse of power. But groups like the ACLU and Democracy Forward, as well as state attorneys general have stalled and defeated many of the worst excesses through hundreds of lawsuits.  
Those wins are piling up, and the fact remains most judges have a deep understanding of and respect for constitutional law. The First Amendment is alive and well, as reflected in a fiery decision out of Massachusetts rejecting the Trump regime’s assault on academic freedom.
The courts alone will not save us, but they offer an important check on the executive branch and can defend the constitutional foundations that exist to guard against autocracy. 
In Vermont and nationwide, there are many examples of other leaders and institutions who have stood up to federal overreach and abuse of power with the backing of their local communities. 
In February, following a series of threatening executive orders, the Vermont School Board Association briefly removed its policy on the rights of trans students. Community members mobilized in protest, and the policy was quickly reinstated — with an apology. Educational leaders reaffirmed the state’s commitment to fostering inclusive classrooms and protecting the rights of all LGBTQ students. 
In August, the Scott administration refused federal requests to send National Guard troops to Washington, asserting that the governor “does not view enforcement of domestic law as a proper use of the National Guard.” 
And in September, Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas refused to share Vermonters’ voting information with the federal government, citing state law protections that prohibit such disclosure. “[B]y fifth grade, it had become very clear to me that when there’s a bully on the playground, you are not going to win by trying to duck.” 
Faced with a hostile federal government, Vermont leaders have mostly—if not always—risen to the occasion in resisting empty threats and legally dubious demands.  
In the legislature, the ACLU and our partners are working to strengthen our defenses — including  “shield laws” to defend Vermonters’ bodily autonomy, funding for immigration services and more — though there is still far more to be done to meet the moment. The ACLU’s Firewall for Freedom provides a roadmap for state policymakers to enhance legal protections for vulnerable communities in the coming year. 
Most significantly, however, people are not waiting for elected leaders to act — they are showing up for one another every day. More than 7 million people in 2,700 communities mobilized for historic No Kings rallies last month. Federal government incursions have consistently been met with creative, peaceful protest nationwide. 
In Vermont, nearly 170 civil society organizations, including small businesses, faith groups, libraries and nonprofits, have signed on to a statement of solidarity, demanding bold leadership and commitment to our shared values of Freedom and Unity. More than 3,000 national groups have joined a similar initiative. 
For all the chaos and damage caused by the Trump regime, we must not lose sight of these actions and our many victories big and small. We must continue to urge leaders not to reflexively obey unlawful federal demands and to always assert Vermont’s laws and values to the fullest extent.
And, we must continue to recognize our collective strength, as well as the tactics and strategies that have served resistance movements worldwide: 
Be proactive and prepared. Share information and resources. Seek unity and solidarity with diverse people and organizations. Do not comply prematurely or obey unlawful commands. Protest, peacefully. Remain nonviolent, always.  
And perhaps most importantly, demand solutions that work for all of us: instead of attacking our communities, our government should be ensuring everyone’s basic needs are met. 
None of this is easy. The obstacles we face are daunting and the outcomes are uncertain, but, to prevail, we must continually remember our collective power — and use it.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Some 300,000 people covered by Indiana’s Medicaid program will have less than two months to change their health insurance company as state officials are kicking MDwise off the provider list.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration announced Wednesday that MDwise would no longer be among the managed care health plan options for the Healthy Indiana Plan and Hoosier Healthwise programs as of Jan. 1.
Indianapolis-based MDwise, which said it has provided Indiana Medicaid services for over 30 years, has already launched a court challenge to the state’s action.
The four-year contract was signed in 2023. Indiana’s transparency portal shows MDwise has receivhe ed more than $300 million over the last three fiscal years.
MDwise argues that FSSA officials have acted improperly in terminating the company’s four-year contract that was slated to run through the end of 2026, but a Marion County judge denied a request to temporarily block the state’s decision.
The state agency’s action comes as Gov. Mike Braun’s administration has been pushing to stem the Medicaid program’s fast-growing costs — which were projected in April to jump by 9.5% during the current state fiscal year and 7.7% next fiscal year.
“Indiana Medicaid exists to provide dependable, high-quality care for the Hoosiers who rely on it,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said in a statement. “Our review found that, of the four plans, MDwise was both the most expensive and the lowest in quality. Federal rules require us to maintain at least three plans, and this decision allows us to meet those standards while safeguarding members’ access to care.”
Impact on those covered by MDwise
The agency said those covered by MDwise will not lose Medicaid benefits but must select new coverage from among three remaining providers — Anthem, CareSource, or Managed Health Services. Those not making a selection will be assigned to one of those plans.
MDwise clients will receive letters with detailed instructions on how to select a new plan, FSSA said. 
MDwise, a subsidiary of Michigan-based McLaren Health Care, filed a lawsuit against the FSSA in October, seeking to head off the agency’s decision. Marion County Superior Court Judge Christina Klineman on Wednesday gave the company permission to appeal her decision rejecting a temporary restraining order against FSSA.
MDwise said Tuesday that FSSA officials had ignored the company’s proposed performance improvement plan and a request for a three-month delay in the termination so that the company could pursue a sale to another business.










This begins a series of actions that will lead to a chaotic transfer of 300,000 Medicaid health care plan enrollees and the complete destruction of MDwise’s entire business.


– MDwise court filing


“FSSA is trying to avoid paying the true cost of care for Hoosiers,” the company said in a statement. “During discussions with FSSA in September, it became clear that FSSA’s real motivation for pursuing a termination was not MDwise’s performance, but rather because the State’s policies put Medicaid spending on an unsustainable path.”
The state’s decision risks disrupting medical care for MDwise clients, including pushing some to other insurers whose networks don’t include the same health care providers, the company said.
“Instead of working together toward an orderly solution, the state has chosen a rushed path that jeopardizes care for hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers,” the company said. “MDwise presented multiple proposals to ensure a smooth, responsible transition — all of which have been ignored.”
“Despite this setback, MDwise is not giving up. We remain committed to finding a responsible path forward that preserves access to care, protects local jobs and honors our 30-year legacy of serving Indiana’s most vulnerable residents.”
Indiana Medicaid covered about 1.7 million people as of October, according to an FSSA online dashboard. Among the plans offered under Medicaid, Anthem covered 36%, with MDwise and Managed Health Services following at 17% each.
FSSA officials did not immediately have an estimate of cost savings by dropping MDwise.
“The state does anticipate there will be savings from the MDwise termination because members will be assigned to health plans who have better quality ratings and manage members more efficiently,” FSSA Deputy Chief of Staff Marcus Barlow told Indiana Capital Chronicle.
The agency judged MDwise’s quality of service based on ratings from the Washington-based nonprofit National Committee for Quality Assurance and regulatory reporting to the state, Barlow said. FSSA also compared MDwise’s reported spending on medical costs to other health insurers working with the Medicaid program, he said.
MDwise fighting decision in court
The company said in a Marion County court filing that the FSSA’s action would cause “substantial disruption to the enrollees’ own health care services, and the irreversible, quick, and painful destruction of MDwise, including the loss of hundreds of jobs at MDwise and the termination of numerous business relationships with its many Indiana providers and vendors.”
“This begins a series of actions that will lead to a chaotic transfer of 300,000 Medicaid health care plan enrollees and the complete destruction of MDwise’s entire business,” a company court filing said.
The judge on Oct. 23 denied MDwise’s request to temporarily block the state from terminating the company from the Medicaid program, writing that she did not see a “compelling likelihood of success on the merits of the action.”
“The harm that MDwise claims it is likely to face is reasonably calculable by the income it stands to lose as a result of the potential termination of the Contracts,” Klineman wrote. “There is nothing in the record before the Court to suggest that MDwise would be harmed in such a manner that it is not able to be made whole with money damages if they are appropriate.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. House took all of October off. In fact, the GOP-led chamber has only worked 14 days since July 25. As Congress sat idle, hardworking Americans faced rising health care costs, farmers battled dangerous market instability, and millions worried over losing necessary food assistance.
It’s time for Congress to show up for the people it serves — to lower costs, raise wages, and protect the freedom to make choices about our own lives. As the communications and policy director for the Rural Democracy Initiative, I worked with 40 local, state, and national organizations — including the Minnesota-based Land Stewardship Project and CURE — to create the Rural Policy Action Report, which offers a roadmap of popular policies lawmakers could implement today.
Here are five priorities to help families, small businesses and rural communities thrive.
1. Fix health care.
To start, lawmakers should reverse the Medicaid cuts and renew the Affordable Care Act tax credits that they allowed to expire to pass tax breaks for billionaires.
More than undoing the damage Congress did this year, we need them to go further: lower prescription prices, support rural hospitals, and ensure reliable care close to home. Access to life-saving services shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code or your income.
2. Stand with farmers, not just corporations.
For farmers, rising health care costs are just part of the growing challenges.
“Our members are feeling the pain of a chaotic trade policy, massive cuts to USDA programs that serve all farmers and rural communities, and the ever-growing threat from monopolies that manipulate the agriculture marketplace,” said Aaron Lehman of the Iowa Farmers Union, a contributor to the report.
With the Farm Bill years past due, it seems Congress only makes time to fund programs for the biggest agribusinesses. But Congress could help develop local markets by investing in local food systems, reinstating the Local Food Purchase Assistance program that helped schools buy fresh food from local farms, and helping farmers protect soil and water. They should retool crop insurance and credit programs so they work for smaller, more diverse farms.
Farmers watched as new tariffs hurt the U.S. soybean market, and boosted sales for Argentina. To top it off, the Trump administration promised Argentina an additional $20 billion bailout gift. Congress must rein in our trade policy and prioritize independent producers, small-town businesses, and workers.
3. Strengthen public schools.
Rural schools are the heart of their communities, preparing students with the skills to compete. But the federal government diverted billions from public schools to private schools with a voucher tax credit that could cost taxpayers up to $51 billion a year — more than the federal government spends on all public K–12 education.
Lawmakers should stop the voucher programs and instead ensure students have properly funded schools with speech and reading services and support for kids with disabilities.
4. Empower workers
Rural workers often earn less, have fewer benefits, and face higher injury rates. When workers are respected and fairly paid, they spend locally and keep main streets alive. But the Trump administration has tried to eliminate dozens of worker safety rules, rescinded an important overtime rule, and ordered immigration raids at work sites across the country.
Congress should protect the right to organize, ensure safe work sites, and guarantee paid family and medical leave.
5. Make essentials affordable
Everyone should be able to afford groceries, medicine and energy bills — but prices keep climbing. Congress must work to lower prices and enable small businesses to be competitive so people have real choices.
Congress should also restore food assistance, cut costs for child care, housing, and energy, and expand broadband access.
Congress needs to work for us, not for the special interests of big corporations and the ultra wealthy.
Rural communities have been overlooked — or actively harmed — by federal policy. The Rural Policy Action Report shows a better path: a practical plan with example legislation to improve healthcare, support farmers, strengthen public schools, stand with workers and lower costs.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)On Wednesday night, the House passed and President Donald Trump signed a spending package that reopens the federal government after a record-breaking shutdown and funds most of it through January.
The House passed the bill 222-209, with most Republicans voting in favor and most Democrats voting no. Democrats largely opposed the measure because it does not extend federal subsidies for health care plans purchased on the individual marketplace, subsidies that are expiring this year.
In final House speech, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill urges nation to ‘stand strong’

Here’s what New Jersey’s House members said about the funding package:
 Rep. Donald Norcross (D) voted no.
“For 43 days, America has been held hostage by this Republican shutdown. While it is a great relief that our federal workers will finally receive their hard-earned paycheck, not everyone is celebrating. There are some Americans who may be getting a death sentence as they lose their lifesaving health care coverage. I’m voting no on the Senate’s proposed government funding bill because lives are at risk.”
 Rep. Herb Conaway (D) voted no.
“I’ve been crystal clear from the start: I won’t support any funding bill without the ACA tax credit. I voted NO on the CR tonight because it fails to meet the moment — and unfortunately, the American people will feel the effects of this failure the most. This fight isn’t over.”
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (Photo by Danielle Richards/New Jersey Monitor)
 Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D) voted no.
“From day one of this shutdown, I’ve been clear: We must protect families from surging health care costs. Families are already suffering under the weight of child care, groceries, and higher energy bills. We had one request from Speaker Johnson: Let us vote to extend the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits and save families thousands on their health insurance premiums. They refused. They didn’t give the American people more affordable health care, so they don’t get my vote.”
 Rep. Frank Pallone (D) voted no.
“I voted NO to cutting your health care. I voted NO to sending your neighbors into bankruptcy because they can’t pay for their health insurance. I voted NO to making your relatives sicker. Republicans simply could not care less. I promise you, I’m going to fight every day in Congress to get your health care back and fight for what Republicans won’t: lower costs, healthier families, and a more prosperous America.”
Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)
 Rep. Tom Kean (R) voted yes.
“Today, I once again voted to keep the federal government open and get back to doing the people’s business. Every step of the way, Republicans stood on the principles of good government, fiscal discipline, and common-sense. We fought to ensure that critical services from air traffic control to SNAP benefits were maintained. This shutdown was a reckless political ploy by Democrats that achieved nothing but unnecessary hardship for American families. The American people deserve a government that works for them — not one held hostage by partisan games.”
 Rep. Rob Menendez (D) voted no.
“The funding bill that Republicans just passed fails to extend the ACA tax credits and will make health care more expensive at a time when so many Americans are stretched thin. Individuals and families in New Jersey are already seeing the damaging consequences of this as they look to enroll in health insurance for next year. That’s why I voted NO.”
 Rep. Nellie Pou (D) voted no.
“I support reopening the federal government – but not at the cost of skyrocketing health care premiums. I am pleased that the longest government shutdown in our history is ending and federal employees like air traffic controllers will finally be paid. I am not pleased that tens of thousands of my constituents will pay an average of nearly $3,000 more for their health care. I am angry that millions of Americans will pay much higher health care costs because of this bad deal. At a time when Americans are struggling to pay record prices across the board, the Republican House tonight voted to raise costs even more. This is unacceptable and so I voted no without reservation.”
 Rep. LaMonica McIver (D) voted no.
“I started off the morning having surgery, resting for few, and then hopping on a train to come to D.C. to try to protect your health care, to make sure that you have affordable health care, to make sure that my constituents are not being priced out, to be able to take care of themselves and have the dignified health care that they deserve. And Republicans just don’t see that, they don’t understand that, they don’t give a damn about that, and it’s horrible. But I’m going to keep fighting for you because that is what you elected me to do.”

Josh Hawley speaks to reporters at the governor's ham breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia on Aug. 15, 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Let’s talk about what happens when Josh Hawley gets angry.
Missouri’s senior U.S. senator doesn’t take criticism lightly — whether from the press, his colleagues or anyone he perceives as an enemy. His approach? If you get hit, hit back harder.
It’s not just a defense mechanism. It’s a political strategy. All criticism draws a counterattack, and the conflict itself becomes the story.
Case in point: A few weeks ago, Hawley blasted Ameren Missouri over utility shut-offs and rate hikes, blaming the surge in electricity use from new data centers for “sucking up the electricity off the grid, taking it away from hard-working Missourians.”
That didn’t land well with Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a fellow Republican. In a letter to Hawley’s office, she called his claims “misleading” and warned his rhetoric could “unnecessarily alarm the very people we both serve.”
Instead of a debate on energy policy, Hawley mocked O’Laughlin on social media as a mere “state politician” doing the bidding of her campaign donors.
It’s a familiar pattern that repeats throughout Hawley’s career with almost mathematical precision.
Shortly after Hawley was sworn in as Missouri attorney general in 2017, consultants from his political campaign began working out of his official office, directing government staff and using private email accounts to dodge Missouri’s open-records laws.
When the arrangement was revealed in the run up to Hawley’s 2018 Senate election, he attacked the media, called the story “absurdly false” and painted himself in the campaign’s homestretch as the victim of left-wing attacks.
It wasn’t until four years into his first Senate term that a judge eventually determined Hawley’s attorney general’s office had, in fact, “knowingly and purposefully” violated open records laws to protect his campaign from public scrutiny, ordering the state to pay $240,000 in legal fees. A state audit also concluded Hawley may have misused state resources to boost his Senate campaign.
In 2020, the Kansas City Star reported Hawley was registered to vote at his sister’s home in Ozark. At the time, the Hawleys only owned property in the D.C. suburbs, though they were building a house in Missouri.
Facing questions about his ties to Missouri, Hawley called the Star a “dumping ground for Democrat BS” while his allies dug up the reporter’s years-old stories from college to suggest he was biased.
Republican U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner questioned the cost of expanding the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act — a bill Hawley championed to aid St. Louis-area residents harmed by Cold War nuclear testing. Hawley called Wagner’s comments “shameful” and said she was turning her back on her constituents.
Hawley labeled conservative columnist George Will an out-of-touch elitist (“dont’ you have a country club to go to?”) over a critical newspaper column and demanded Wal-Mart “apologize for using slave labor” over a critical social media post.
In today’s political marketplace, anger is currency. Outrage drives clicks, donations and loyalty.
Hawley thrives in that arena, turning every criticism into proof of persecution that mobilizes his political base and feeds the image he hopes to convey of a warrior fighting the political establishment.
But to Hawley’s detractors, it’s all theater, his outrage little more than a tactic used to distract from tough questions and avoid accountability.
The recent flare-up with O’Laughlin has cooled, but not because of reconciliation. When asked recently by a reporter from Nexstar if he’d reached out to her, Hawley replied simply: “No, I don’t know her.”
For Hawley, the fight isn’t a byproduct of politics — it is politics.

Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) speaks Wednesday about the effort to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act insurance premium tax credits that will expire at the end of 2025. Nancy Peske, left, and Julia Harris-Robinson, center also joined the press conference. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)With the loss of enhanced subsidies for the health insurance she has bought on the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov, Nancy Peske’s health plan will cost $1,163.50 a month in 2026.
That’s more than three times what she paid this year — $372 a month, Peske said Wednesday.
But if there’s one thing she wants everyone to know, it’s this: The higher prices for health insurance aren’t just something that she and other people who buy their coverage on the federal marketplace are facing.
Long before the ACA, Peske learned about “the premium death spiral,” she said.
“The more you raise the price, the more people drop out of the pool. This means you have to raise the price, which means more people drop out of the pool. And it goes on and on and on,” Peske said.
“It’s not just my health insurance that’s going to go up. It’s everybody’s — right?” she said. “We’re all in this together.”
Peske was one of two people who have relied on HealthCare.gov, created as part of the Affordable Care Act, who spoke Wednesday at a press conference in Milwaukee with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin).
Baldwin called the press conference  to draw attention anew to the skyrocketing cost of health insurance — and to the failure of Congress to address it in the stopgap spending bill that passed the U.S. Senate Monday, the U.S. House Wednesday evening and was signed by President Donald Trump.
“This is a health and wellness issue,” Baldwin said. “This is an affordability and cost-of-living issue, and this is a quality of life and dignity issue. And it touches every single one of us right now.”
A success amid ‘a broken system’
Health care in the U.S. is “a broken system that prioritizes profits over patients,” Baldwin said. Despite that, she said, the 2010 Affordable Care Act was an important advance for expanding health care access.
She said that was improved by enhanced federal subsidies enacted in 2021 to offset the cost of health insurance for people who must buy their own policies on the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace that was created by the ACA — making insurance more affordable and drawing record numbers of people to the marketplace to get health coverage.
The enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025, however, and until this week a Republican stopgap spending bill that passed the U.S. House in September stalled in the U.S. Senate as Democrats pushed unsuccessfully to extend the subsidies.  
“That is what is at the center of the government shutdown and debate in Washington, D.C.,” Baldwin said. “We know the impact of taking away these tax breaks. For 275,000 Wisconsinites, their health care [insurance] costs will double, triple or even more. For 30,000 Wisconsinites, they predict the price will be too high, and that those Wisconsinites will go without insurance altogether.”
A handful of Democratic Senators changed their votes Monday to advance the spending bill in return for a promise of a future vote on the subsidies, with the House taking up the revised bill Wednesday. Baldwin didn’t join them.
“I said the entire time that a handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no real action to lower health care costs was simply not good enough,” said Baldwin of her vote against the bill.
She also forced an amendment to extend the tax credits for a year — a compromise, she said, because she wants them extended permanently, but one she offered “to avoid catastrophe for families across Wisconsin and give folks breathing room while we negotiate longer-term solutions.”
The amendment failed on a party-line vote.
“Every single Republican voted no on my amendment,” Baldwin said. “They chose to send a clear, unmistakable message that they are OK with jacking up health care costs on 22 million Americans.”
Early retirement, then sticker shock
HealthCare.gov user Erica Topps also joined Baldwin’s news conference. Topps took early retirement in April and bought a health insurance policy through the federal marketplace for herself and her college-age daughter that started in June.
At the marketplace open enrollment for 2026 that started Nov. 1, that plan’s premium increased by $1,200 a month and the deductible went from $6,700 per person to $10,600 per person, Topps told reporters She found another plan via the marketplace and is enrolling, but she’s concerned about the future beyond that.
“Part of my plan is to go back to work” so she can get health insurance, Topps told the Wisconsin Examiner, because it will be 10 years before she can qualify for Medicare.
Before taking early retirement, “I did my due diligence,” she said. “I feel like the rug was pulled out from under me.”
Peske is a freelance writer, editor and consultant. She is also a cancer survivor, whose diagnosis two years ago was covered thanks to her HealthCare.gov policy. Going without health insurance is unthinkable, but at the age of 63, she must wait another two years before she can go on Medicare, she said.
Peske told the Wisconsin Examiner that she will scrape together the money to afford her new premium. “I’ll not put a dime into my underfunded retirement account,” she said. She expects to “tighten the belt” on household expenses, “and I will probably cut into my savings.”
Freelancers and small businesses account for 40% of the U.S. economy, Peske told reporters.
“Do you want everyone to go out of business?” she asked. “Should I just do what so many people do and get a much lower paying job at a company? Because I’m desperate for health care. I don’t think that’s the solution. I think you want to keep people like me in business, generating money, adding to the economy, and being able to live, to not die of cancer.”
Seeking inroads with GOP lawmakers
Baldwin said she has been talking with Republicans about finding common ground in increased transparency in the health care system, from insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers and providers.
In addition, she told the Wisconsin Examiner after the press conference, she continues to have conversations with GOP Senate colleagues who have expressed interest in continuing the subsidies to avert the sharp hike in premiums.
None of them were willing to break ranks and vote for her amendment this week, however.
“Those discussions were happening informally, in quiet, not in the public spotlight,” Baldwin said. “But they were afraid to vote on something that they, probably, some of them want, because Donald Trump said you can’t talk about this before the government reopens.”
Baldwin said that the next step will be for the Democrats to settle on the bill that Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has promised they could bring to the upper chamber for a vote.
As much as she favors a permanent extension of the enhanced credits, if the Democrats go that route, “we know it will go down, and it will be on a pretty much a partisan vote,” Baldwin said.
“I want results, so that probably dictates towards supporting something that conceivably does respond to some of the concerns Republicans have raised,” she said. “I’d like to pick the path most reasonably likely to succeed on behalf of the people who sent me to Washington to fight for them.”

Joe Cryan wants all parties to give consent. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey lawmaker wants to alter New Jersey’s law governing the recording of phone calls and other conversations.
The bill introduced by state Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union) would require consent from all parties to a conversation, rather than the one-party consent called for under current law. Cryan said it’s a bid to blunt scams using increasingly robust audio deepfakes.
“I’ve had life experiences relayed to me about people being taped and that taping being used for nefarious reasons. As a result of that, protections really should be discussed,” Cryan said.
Under New Jersey law, a person can record a conversation so long as they are party to it or have consent from at least one person who is. The federal government, Washington D.C., and 38 other states use that same framework, while 11 states require consent from all parties to a conversation.
The bill, introduced last month, has already drawn controversy over its potential impact on news reporters who record interviews and events to ensure they can accurately quote speakers. New Jersey Press Association Chairman Brett Ainsworth said the group opposes the measure as drafted and said it could have unintended consequences outside of the media.
It could bar domestic violence victims from recording their abusers absent the abuser’s consent, limit workers’ ability to record harassment from managers, or prevent whistleblowers from coming forward, said CJ Griffin, the association’s general counsel. Griffin has represented the New Jersey Monitor in a variety of legal matters.
“Even if the sponsor includes an exception to allow the media to record, the bill will still stand in the way of reporting because journalists would lose an important source — whistleblowers and others who have documentary evidence of wrongdoing caught on tape,” Griffin said. “There are also serious constitutional concerns because the public has a First Amendment right to record the police or public officials, for example.”
Ainsworth questioned whether the bill would do much to blunt deepfake scams.
Audio deepfakes generally require a sample of the voice they’re spoofing. That sample can be pulled from existing sources posted online or be purpose-made for the deepfake.
“From my personal perspective, the deepfake issue is a serious one, but I fail to see how two-party consent would be effective. Wouldn’t the faker just manufacture a deepfake anyway?” Ainsworth said.
The use of deepfakes to aid crimes is already illegal. Under a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law in April, those who produce or share deepfakes with an unlawful purpose — say, to extort or defraud someone — face up to five years imprisonment and fines of up to $30,000.
One-party consent recording would carry similar penalties under Cryan’s bill, which calls for prison sentences of between three and five years and up to $15,000 in fines.
It’s not clear when the bill might be heard by the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee. At present, it has no companion in the Assembly.

In a press release issued last month, the Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources announced that it issued a request for information document called “Nuclear Development Incentives.” 
Through the document, the state hopes to identify specific initiatives that would make the Gem State the preferred destination for companies seeking to invest in nuclear development, state officials said. 
Idaho is already home to Idaho National Laboratory, or INL, a U.S. Department of Energy national lab that describes itself as the nation’s leading nuclear energy research lab. Now, state leaders want to become a leading destination for companies investing in nuclear energy. 
“Idaho’s long-standing infrastructure, skilled workforce, and policy leadership positions the state as an ideal destination for companies seeking to invest in nuclear development,” state officials said in a press release issued Oct. 28. “(The Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources) is eager to learn how Idaho can become the preferred location for nuclear development.”

Through the “Nuclear Development Incentives” request for information, the state hopes to learn key factors that influence site selection decisions, infrastructure requirements and preferences, regulatory and permitting considerations, workforce needs, effective incentives and partnership opportunities, as well as barriers to investment, state officials said. 
Momentum has been building around nuclear energy in Idaho and through the United States in recent months. Idaho National Laboratory officials announced they are in the process of permitting and building the first new nuclear reactors in 50 years, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner told an interim committee of the Idaho Legislature in July that President Donald Trump is ushering in a nuclear renaissance by issuing a series of pro-nuclear executive orders and policies.
And in September Gov. Brad Little announced a new task force intended to advance nuclear energy.
“The world is changing rapidly,” Little said during a September visit to Idaho National Laboratory. “Energy demand is expected to increase by an unprecedented 30% in the near future. We cannot do that with our legacy energy. We are going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy.”  
Responses to Idaho’s request for information are due by 5 p.m. Mountain time on Dec. 12.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana State Police officially unveiled a new era of patrol vehicles Wednesday — blue-and-white Dodge Durangos and Ford Mustang GTs — that ISP leaders said will boost visibility, modernize the statewide fleet and better equip troopers to combat aggressive driving and street racing across the state.
Standing before the 20 newest troopers receiving their first commission cars, ISP Superintendent Anthony Scott called the rollout “a bridge to the future” for an agency balancing tradition with public safety innovation.
“The new classic two-tone design of our police cruiser symbolizes ISP’s mission to serve Hoosiers with pride, visibility and tradition,” Scott told recruits during the morning ceremony at the District 52 post on the east side of Indianapolis.
“While the color scheme is a salute to our past, it’s also a bridge to the future of the Indiana State Police,” he continued, “and a future that each one of you will help forge.”
It’s the first time in 60 years that the agency has used the blue design. Troopers’ cars during the early- and mid-1960s were white over blue but changed to all white patrol cars in 1966.

ISP switched all black patrol cars in 1998, and in 2006 white reappeared as the standard patrol car color, police archives show.
“As these new Troopers begin their service, they carry forward a proud tradition of protecting Hoosiers with integrity and courage,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “The new patrol vehicles are a fitting way to mark this next chapter — honoring our history while equipping the Indiana State Police for the future.”
The updated look is part of a multiyear overhaul of the state’s fleet. 
The 2023 Durangos will phase in as current police vehicles — primarily the long-serving Dodge Chargers — are retired and replaced. The process to replace the older models has already taken several years due to the time needed to outfit and deploy new cars for patrol use.
ISP spokesperson Capt. Ron Galaviz said that once the full transition is complete, the agency will no longer have white patrol vehicles.
“Over the next year, the fleet will look a whole lot different,” he said.
New cars — and a new focus
Public records show the agency spent roughly $26 million to order more than 500 Dodge Durango Pursuit models from Dodge to replace the older Chargers. That older Charger fleet dates back to 2010.
Each fully-equipped unit was estimated at about $50,000, with additional costs for outfitting. The new Durangos, for example, come with updated technology like in-car cameras, radar and push bumpers.
“For more than 70 years, the bond between Stellantis and the Indiana State Police has been forged in strength, reliability, and a shared commitment to public service,” said Ryan Austin, law enforcement program manager, Stellantis, the parent company of Dodge. “We design our Pursuit vehicles with safety, durability, and performance in mind, so that every officer or trooper who steps into one can focus on what matters most: keeping people safe.”

For newly minted Trooper Daysia Tallman, Wednesday’s ceremony marked her first day on solo patrol and the first time taking the keys to a car of her own. The 20 probationary troopers graduated from the academy in July and spent the months since completing field training.
They took possession of their new vehicles and dispersed statewide for the first day of patrol on Wednesday.
“It’s just a really big milestone. Today’s a very important day — and we’re the very first class to have these new vehicles,” said Tallman, a member of the 87th ISP Recruit Academy class. “The trust that they put in you to be able to have your own vehicle — it’s amazing.”
She added that the color and design are intended to improve officer safety.
“It’s supposed to help us be more visible — because now, when you see that blue car, you know it’s a state trooper,” Tallman said. “If we’re on a traffic stop or working a crash, hopefully the new look helps citizens see us sooner and prevents other crashes.”
‘This is my office’
The rollout also marks the first phase of what ISP calls “high visibility patrol,” which includes five marked Ford Mustangs distributed across the state’s five primary areas in central Indiana, Fort Wayne, northwest Indiana, Evansville and Sellersburg. 
The high-performance vehicles are especially intended to address a surge in road rage, reckless driving and illegal street racing across Indiana — and be more visible in the process.
Four of the Mustangs are assigned to veteran master troopers with at least 15 years of experience. Troopers selected to drive a Mustang had to submit a memo to the superiors and were hand-selected by Scott. They also had to undergo specialized driving training.
The Mustangs — equipped with 5.0-liter “Coyote” engines, radar systems, in-car cameras and dash-mounted computers — will help to intercept aggressive drivers before they cause crashes, said Master Trooper Nick Klingkammer, an 18-year ISP veteran. 
State police officials emphasized that the vehicles are meant to deter, not invite, pursuits.

Klingkammer, who’s assigned to District 5 in central Indiana, was among the five selected to receive a Mustang. During a ride-along, Klingkammer called it “a mobile office” and a tool for prevention.
“This is where I spend my day,” he said, gesturing to the vehicle’s compact interior.
His Mustang had just 759 miles when he left the ISP parking lot on Wednesday. The master trooper hadn’t yet conducted a traffic stop when he started his patrol. He expects his first stop to come sometimes Thursday, after technicians make some final electrical tweaks.
“Any trooper who works the road — their office is their car,” Klingkammer emphasized.
He said the Mustangs’ agility and speed will help troopers safely catch up to drivers traveling 90 or 100 miles per hour, or prevent high-speed chases altogether.
“This car has the capability to drive at high speeds,” Klingkammer said. “We have the training to drive at high speeds. But our goal is prevention — to get one person to rethink their mindset, not to get into a pursuit or street race. If that happens, we’ve won.”
The new vehicles are also intended to boost officer safety and public visibility. Klingkammer noted that the “bold” design attracts attention even when parked on the side of the interstate.










It’s just all part of the same goal — make our roads safer.


– Indiana State Police Master Trooper Nick Klingkammer


“I guarantee you I’m the talk of the interstate right now because of these truckers going by,” he said Wednesday afternoon while monitoring traffic on Interstate 70 just east of Indianapolis. “They’re going, ‘Oh my God, they’re in a Mustang.’”
While the cars can accelerate quickly —  hitting 100 miles an hour in about four seconds — Klingkammer said troopers won’t be driving them in snow or ice.
The rear-wheel-drive Mustangs will likely be swapped out for all-wheel-drive Durangos on rough weather days in winter months “to protect taxpayer money” and avoid unnecessary risk.
“At the end of the day, no matter the car, we’re representing our agency, and we want to make sure that we’re doing it in a professional way — where people understand, ‘Hey, yep, I messed up,’” Klinghammer said. “And in doing that, probably nine out of 10 stops that I make, I’m usually getting a ‘Thank you.’ It’s just all part of the same goal — make our roads safer.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is over and all we got was the near-cancellation of food assistance just in time for Thanksgiving and a looming explosion in health care costs.
None of the problems that led to the shutdown have been resolved. Instead, a handful of Democrats abandoned their fight to force Congress to address the health care crisis in exchange for rolling back some of the damage the Trump administration did during the shutdown itself. Federal workers are getting their jobs back — for now — and flight cancellations will end just in time for the holiday travel season. Otherwise, we’re pretty much back where we started. 
Democrats are fuming and Republicans are gloating over the end of this game of chicken, in which the party that showed it doesn’t care at all about the pain and suffering of its own constituents is the apparent winner. Stay tuned to see how long the glow of victory lasts as members of Congress go home to face the voters. 
During the fruitless shutdown battle, a couple of politicians from Wisconsin who are not facing election anytime soon showed real leadership. Their focus on serving the needs of real people, not political posturing, was a breath of fresh air, and a model of the kind of public service we badly need.
Gov. Tony Evers deserves a lot of credit for acting quickly to pay out food assistance funds to nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites last Friday as soon as a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release the money, which it had been withholding for a week. Evers acted in the nick of time. The Trump administration appealed the decision and, on the strength of an emergency ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, demanded that Wisconsin and other states that had paid out the benefits overnight claw them back. Evers issued a terse response: “No.” 
Thanks to his leadership, hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites, including 270,000 kids, were spared from going hungry because of the Trump administration’s capricious cruelty. With the shutdown over, the battle over food assistance has ended and the USDA has said full nutrition benefits will begin flowing to states again within 24 hours of the shutdown’s end. But as Evers said when he seized the moment and released the funds, “It never should’ve come to this.” The feds had the money to prevent kids from going hungry all along. Trump made a deliberate decision to cut off aid, and then to demand that states pay only partial benefits, on the theory that doing so would punish Democrats for refusing to reopen the government on Trump’s terms. 
Evers deserves a lot of credit for his decisive action to protect Wisconsinites from harm.
Another Wisconsin politician who has been working overtime to stave off disaster for residents is U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. 
Baldwin has spent her entire career working to expand health care access, including writing the provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they reach the age of 26. She has a reputation for doggedly working across the aisle and, during the shutdown, she never gave up trying to get Senate Republicans to agree to extend ACA tax credits. 
This week, when eight Senate Democrats joined the Republicans on a resolution to reopen the government that didn’t include any language about the coming spike in health care costs, Baldwin forced a Senate vote on an amendment to extend the ACA credits for one more year. Many Senate Republicans had told her they knew the expiration of those credits would drive health care costs through the roof in their states.  
In her floor speech introducing her amendment, Baldwin said: 
“My Republican colleagues are refusing to act to stop health care premiums from doubling for over 20 million Americans. I just can’t stand by without a fight.”
Even as people across the country express shock and dismay, “Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have simply refused to address the biggest increase in American premiums they’ll likely ever experience,” Baldwin said.  
“I’m getting calls daily from Wisconsinites begging me to stay in this fight,” she added. She told her Senate colleagues about a couple from Door County who told her their premiums are going up by over $550 per month because of the failure to extend the ACA tax credits. “Everything is already too expensive. So where are they supposed to find 6,500 extra dollars in their budget?” she asked. 
Another couple from Butternut, Wisconsin, told her their premiums are going from $400 per month to more than $5,000 per month — “that’s $55,000 more a year,” she said. “As they wrote to me, ‘health care tax breaks are not just numbers on paper. They are a lifeline that allows us to sleep at night knowing that we won’t lose everything if one of us gets sick.’” 
Baldwin was back in the state Wednesday where, as Erik Gunn reports, she is holding a series of town hall meetings with people affected by rising health care costs. She is holding out hope that some of her Republican colleagues will come around on the issue. She refused to answer questions about whether she thinks Sen. Chuck Schumer should be ousted from his position as Minority Leader because of the end of the shutdown fight. 
Characteristically, she is keeping her head down and working to build bipartisan support — as she did, successfully, when she persuaded enough Republicans to join her to pass the Respect for Marriage Act protecting same-sex and interracial couples — instead of using it to score political points.
As we move past the shutdown power struggle and into the real fight over people’s lives, we need more of that kind of leadership.

At the Delaware-sized Converse County Oil and Gas Project, feds illegally issued more than 200 drilling permits, threatening sage grouse, other birds, water and wildlife, conservationists claim.

The federal government is skirting a court ruling and has illegally issued more than 200 permits to drill for oil and gas in a controversial Delaware-sized prospect near Douglas, conservationists claim in a new legal filing.
Operators are already drilling wells in the Converse County Oil and Gas Project in violation of a slew of environmental regulations, the Powder River Basin Resource Council and Western Watersheds Project contend in a 108-page Nov. 5 court filing. The legal papers supplement an ongoing case against the U.S. Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management.
Industry drilling activity and federal actions to authorize 5,000 wells across 1.5 million acres threaten 54 greater sage grouse breeding-ground leks and numerous raptor nests, the complaint states. The proposed wells could deplete groundwater and affect pronghorn and mule deer habitat on public and private land across the region.
The conservation groups successfully sued to block the project last year when a federal judge agreed that the government misstated available drilling groundwater “by a factor of 10,000.”
“By plowing ahead with the project despite an unresolved court order halting new drilling permits, the BLM is rubbing salt in the wounds of the communities and species.” Sarah Stellberg
“We won our case in September,” after challenging the project’s environmental impact statement, said Sarah Stellberg, staff attorney at the nonprofit Advocates for the West, which represents the conservation groups. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a temporary injunction in 2024, and the BLM issued no drilling permits for about a year after, Stellberg said.
But in August, the BLM began approving drilling permits based on new environmental reviews and a flawed revision of groundwater, the updated suit contends.
“To avoid that [Chutkan] ruling, BLM started pushing out these piecemeal [environmental] documents, none of which fixed the issues,” Stellberg said. “By plowing ahead with the project despite an unresolved court order halting new drilling permits, the BLM is rubbing salt in the wounds of the communities and species negatively impacted by this behemoth industrial development,” she said in a separate statement.
No production?
An industry group spokesman rejected the conservation claims, saying “it is clear that the only acceptable outcome for these groups is no production at all.” Ryan McConnaughey, in a statement from the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, said the conservation groups failed to point out any harm, yet persist in filing claims.
“Technological advancements in both drilling and reclamation sciences have continued to reduce impacts on Wyoming landscapes while increasing both production and revenues to the state,” the PAW statement reads. “We will continue to vigorously fight these efforts on behalf of the industry, Wyoming’s communities and the people who rely on the good paying jobs found in Wyoming’s oil and natural gas industry.”
The government has yet to react to the supplemental complaint, and the BLM did not respond to a request for comment this week. The BLM claims to have addressed the deficiencies alleged in the original lawsuit by supplementing the flawed environmental report this summer.
Wyoming has joined the lawsuit on the side of the federal government defendants. The state asked Chutkan on Friday to allow a delayed response to the new claims. Wyoming should respond only when the government does — a schedule likely slowed by the government shutdown, according to court documents.

The conservation groups say the government and its court friends, including PAW, should not be allowed extra time. Conservationists “face substantial prejudice and irreparable harm to themselves and the environment,” court papers say. “Principles of justice” require the case move forward expeditiously, the groups state.
“BLM should not be permitted to continue approving oil and gas development during the shutdown while simultaneously claiming the shutdown precludes it from defending those very actions in court,” reads one motion from the environmental groups that references the record federal closure.
Devon Energy, called out in the suit for recently preparing drilling sites, did not respond to a query about the environmental embroglio. The Oklahoma company advertises on its website “environmentally responsible production,” and “a culture of health, safety and environmental stewardship.”
Whistleblower
The drilling plan, promoted by Devon, Chesapeake Energy Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Northwoods Energy and EOG Resources, Inc., ran into trouble at the beginning when a BLM whistleblower claimed the agency was dismissing worries about migrating and nesting raptors. The BLM fired him in 2021, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, for doing his job.
In 2020, in the waning days of President Trump’s first administration, the government approved the project.
“The Converse County Project is a capstone of the first Trump administration’s push for ‘energy dominance’ in public lands management, and its efforts to relieve the fossil fuel industry from federal environmental safeguards, including under the Clean Air Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse Plan Amendments,” the latest filing states. Drilling would majorly affect air quality locally and regionally, including in national parks. The drilling program abandons traditional wildlife protections like seasonal drilling restrictions, conservationists contend.
Among the new court charges is that the BLM is issuing drilling permits based on yet another flawed groundwater analysis and without allowing the public to comment. Up to 283 wells have been approved recently, most of them illegally, the suit contends.
Many issues in the original suit remain unresolved, Stellberg said, because Judge Chutkan did not need to address them after she found the first fatal groundwater flaw.
The lawsuit seeks to resolve whether the government can regulate landscape disturbance, destruction and other impacts from oil and gas wells that are drilled on private property but access both private and public resources locked underground. Such wells are known as fee/fee/fed wells, acknowledging the split ownership and interests.
The BLM says it has no authority to regulate impacts on such wells; conservationists disagree.
Federal analyses also fail to take a comprehensive look at incremental harms to the environment as they add up — a concept known as cumulative impacts, the latest filings contend. Instead, the government is now approving wells on a piecemeal basis.
In doing so, the government is nickel-and-diming natural assets across the sprawling terrain, even after it acknowledged it needs to take a comprehensive look at the project by preparing an environmental report, according to the recent court filings.
“All these other issues are teed up before the court and awaiting a ruling,” Stellberg said.

Women’s Action Network white paper lays out ""low-hanging-fruit"" strategies to increase access and care by pooling resources and investing in low-cost, big-impact programs.
The post Wyoming lags on solutions while maternal care crisis grows, report finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Since 2022, four Wyoming hospitals have closed labor and delivery wards, leaving 16 birthing hospitals for a state spanning 97,000 square miles. Medical workforce shortages, onerous on-call doctor schedules and mounting affordability challenges have only exacerbated the state’s growing maternity care gaps. 
The problem is not unique to Wyoming, but the state lags behind others in embracing and implementing solutions, according to a new Wyoming Women’s Action Network white paper. 
Wyoming, for example, is the only state not to participate in the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an initiative to support best practices that make births safer and improve maternal health outcomes. 
“There are tools that are available to us that really haven’t been a focus of discussion, and could maybe start to make a significant difference,” said Jen Simon of the Wyoming Women’s Action Network. Like so many complicated issues, Simon said, “there’s no silver bullet. It’s going to take [multiple] efforts to really address it. And so, let’s start to identify what low-hanging fruit might be.”
That was one goal of the white paper, titled “The Equality State’s Growing Crisis: What maternity deserts mean for Wyoming and how we can turn the tide for moms and babies.” 

This map illustrates that Wyoming is the only state not participating in the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, a quality improvement initiative to support best practices that make births safer and improve maternal health outcomes. (Wyoming Women’s Action Network) 
By collecting baseline data and policy directions, Simon said, the hope is to underscore an array of steps — even small ones — that can lead to more robust maternity care. 
“We do in fact have options,” she said. 
Along with joining the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Care, “low-hanging-fruit” strategies range from distributing low-cost alert bracelets to new mothers to convening an annual summit for sharing best practices. 
Rising challenges, falling births 
A dearth of maternal health care has made pregnancy and childbirth increasingly tricky in widening swaths of Wyoming, a 2023 WyoFile investigation found. 
This is evident in Fremont County, where moms are opting to temporarily relocate to places like Denver and even the East Coast to deliver babies. It is evident in Rawlins, where families have to travel Interstate 80, a notorious stretch of highway that closes frequently in the winter, to deliver in Laramie. And it is evident in Teton County, where overflow patients from elsewhere in the state are straining OB-GYN providers. 
Lawmakers made maternity care a top issue of study for the 2024 legislative off-season and began to identify a complicated mix of challenges for providing such care in rural places, though they didn’t pass any policies. 

This map reflects birthing facility closures in Wheatland, Evanston, Rawlins, Kemmerer and Riverton. (Wyoming Women’s Action Network) 
Meanwhile, births continue to fall in many Wyoming hospitals, and a fifth facility, Platte County Hospital in Wheatland, temporarily shut down its delivery services in October.For the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee, maternity care was the No. 1 priority again during the 2025 off-season, or interim. 
Committee members discussed the issue in depth in October and acknowledged the problem’s scope is daunting. Proposed measures, such as one they advanced to authorize freestanding birth centers to get Medicaid coverage for midwife births, are merely “band-aids” that could perhaps keep maternity care limping along in its current state, lawmakers said. 
That leads to Simon’s point that Wyoming doesn’t have to focus on large-scale state-level reforms for solutions. 
“It’s such a significant challenge to move things through the legislature in every state, not just this state,” she said. The intent of the white paper is “to really be thinking about what would be accessible for hospitals and providers, and what are some best practices that are really simple and straightforward.”
Training, sharing, legislating
The paper’s more accessible recommendations include instituting an annual, statewide maternal health summit — an effort already underway. There are also training approaches, such as the Obstetric Patient Safety Program, commonly known as OPS, which is designed to help medical providers prepare for obstetrical emergencies. 
Postpartum birth alert bracelets, meanwhile, represent a simple and inexpensive tool that alerts health care providers to patients who have delivered within the previous six weeks. That can help ensure recognition and response to complications such as hemorrhage, hypertensive crises or infection — leading contributors to postpartum maternal mortality.
There are also local-level models, such as a community-wide prenatal access program developed in Teton County, as well as inclusion in national expertise pools. 
“Participation in [Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health] would give Wyoming access to resources, technical assistance, and collaborative partners to better collect and report data, implement strategies to address identified issues, and ultimately improve maternal outcomes,” the white paper reads.

It also identifies more-involved strategies aimed at improving local capacity, affordability and workforce recruitment. These include initiatives like expanding physician access to remote support from maternal-fetal medicine specialists, administering matching-funds loan-repayment programs for health care professionals or boosting reimbursement for providing maternity services to Medicaid patients.
The Labor Committee in October voted down draft legislation that would provide for increased Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for OB services and critical access hospitals.
Even though government can play a vital role in improving maternity care, Simon said, she hopes to convey that other meaningful avenues exist. 
“Here’s some things that can be done, that hospitals can decide, that communities can decide, that individuals can decide,” she said. 
Advances 
The paper also highlights some positive steps and strategies that are rolling out in the maternal health realm. 
This year, for example, Megan Baker of St. John’s Health in Jackson became the first Wyoming Section Chair for the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, which connects her with resources for training and improved obstetric outcomes for Wyoming moms.
Baker, the manager of women’s services at St. John’s, has spearheaded initiatives to bolster the hospital’s maternal health offerings. St. John’s recently became Wyoming’s first hospital to gain a “maternal level of care” designation. She also helped obtain a statewide grant for OB safety courses and acquire alert bracelets for her facility.

Wyoming medical professionals and hospitals will need to work together to combine resources to create a stronger network, Baker said. She is also a proponent of small-cost, big-impact programs like the alert bracelets. 
“I think we have to look at things differently,” she said. “Share resources, share people and figure out how others are doing it.”
If Wyoming’s trend continues, experts worry that mothers will put off or forgo prenatal care, travel long distances in difficult weather or give birth in emergency rooms with nurses who aren’t trained in labor and delivery, which could have dangerous or even deadly results. 
The erosion in care also poses existential threats to communities, as adequate health care is crucial to attracting young families to rural towns, state leaders say. 
“Being able to have a baby, safely, in Wyoming is a harbinger of our state’s present and future prospects,” Wyoming Women’s Action Network Board Member and Teton County Commissioner Natalia Macker said in a release. “The health of our moms, babies, and families is a clear indication of how healthy our hospitals, communities, and economy will be.”

A constitutional amendment first proposed after Watergate would address questionable pardons, writes guest columnist David Adler.
The post Trump’s pardon of crypto king makes case for constitutional reform appeared first on WyoFile .","In a Nov. 2 interview with “60 Minutes”, President Donald Trump pretended that he did not know Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, the cryptocurrency billionaire whom he pardoned, even though in 2023 Zhao pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months in prison for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Specifically, Zhao had failed to implement anti-money laundering procedures. 

Opinion

For those who think this a minor or vanilla offense, consider that the U.S. government had accused him of inflicting “significant harm to US national security,” and said that he had “violated US law on an unprecedented scale.” In the pursuit of profit, Binance’s money-laundering acts had allowed “money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers through its platform.” The terrorists included Hamas and al-Qaida. Why did Trump pardon such a criminal?
Trump said he had been told that the prosecution of the crypto king was an example of a “Biden witch hunt.” Trump said that Zhao “was treated really badly by the Biden administration,” although he claimed that he had “no idea who he is,” but acknowledged, in the same breath, that “he is a successful guy.” Skeptics doubt Trump’s explanation. 
How about self-aggrandizement as a motive for Trump’s pardon of Zhao? Zhao’s company has had business dealings with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency company owned by Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Jr. While seeking a pardon, Zhao hired lawyers and lobbyists with connections to the Trump administration and struck a deal with Trump’s sons that was expected to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for the Trump family for years to come.
When “60 Minutes” host Nora O’Donnell asked Trump if he was concerned about “appearance of corruption,” Trump replied, “I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it.” Trump stood alongside his sons in 2024 when they rolled out the family’s cryptocurrency business. The specter of self-aggrandizement, or more pointedly stated, a “pay-to-play” pardon, raises anew the need to amend the Constitution to check the constitutional grant of the pardoning authority to the president.
Various presidents have granted pardons that have rightly faced backlash. When Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974 for “all” the offenses that “he has committed or may have committed” since his election, Ford sought, in his words, to free the nation from the paralysis of Watergate and spare Nixon from potential prosecution and his family further humiliation. 
Ford declared to America: The rule of law has prevailed. On the contrary, the Nixon pardon foiled the application of the rule of law. If, and when, Nixon had been tried and convicted for his illegal acts, perhaps Ford might have found grounds to pardon the humiliated ex-president, but all he accomplished in granting a pre-trial pardon to Nixon was to spare the Watergate president. 
Americans were deprived of the opportunity to learn whether the rule of law and the criminal justice system could bring an errant president to heel, and whether the rule of law would enjoy widespread support when a president is forced to stand criminal trial. 
The Nixon pardon, alone, it seemed to me years ago, was sufficient to justify a constitutional amendment to place checks on the presidential pardoning authority. In a peer-reviewed, scholarly article, I argued in favor of Sen. Walter Mondale’s proposal in 1974 for a constitutional amendment that would arm Congress with the power to check presidential pardons that seemed, well, unpardonable. Mondale’s proposal stated: “No pardon granted to an individual by the President under Section 2, Article II, shall be effective if Congress by resolution, two-thirds of the members of each House concurring therein, disapproves the granting of the pardon within the 180 days of its issuance.”
In practice, few presidential pardons would be so worrisome to Congress that members would intervene to block it. Only controversial pardons would draw deep concern from Congress. Trump’s pardon of Zhao is such a pardon. His self-aggrandizing exercise of a constitutional power intended to temper justice is so fraught with conflicts of interest that it demands enactment of the Mondale proposal. 
Congress should be suspicious of the motives behind a pardon to a convicted criminal that coincides with his investments to enrich a president’s family. The specter of corruption at the center of the Trump pardon of Zhao deserves scrutiny, even without the Mondale proposal.

Respecting tradition isn't about propping up old industries, but saying yes to new ones, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming must seize her opportunities appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is sitting on a wealth of opportunity. We have abundant natural resources, well-established core industries and room to grow. Many other states do not have these same prospects. We are small, but that allows us to be nimble. We are one of the last places in the U.S. where an enterprising company can build a new industry from the ground up. We can build new things without the burden of having to tear down what came before. We are fresh ground.

Opinion

Despite this advantage, we risk squandering our chances. We have become too focused on recreating the past at the expense of building the future. Historically, our strength has come from our willingness to say yes to opportunities. Recently, however, we have seen too many in our communities and in our leadership who would stop anything that benefits the next generation out of fear that it might upset their comfortable status quo. They do not care about building a legacy; instead, they are focused on maintaining what they already have. It is a short-sighted viewpoint.
The most glaring example of this is the recent decision by Radiant Nuclear to abandon its proposal to build a manufacturing facility in Bar Nunn. The reception this company got from some segments of our state was shocking in its hostility. By showing the company that they were unwelcome, the naysayers cost their community a potentially valuable new industry. Where would Wyoming be if these people were here in the 1970s? Wyoming coal was a small industry then, and national market changes led to rapid development, often in difficult circumstances. Had our current attitude prevailed then, Wyoming coal may never have gotten off the ground, and our state would be far worse because of it.
If Wyoming is going to be anything more than a place for more prosperous states to get their raw materials, we must be open to new opportunities and industries. Our world does not stay static. It changes by the day including the industries that make our society work. Wyoming in the early 1900s was dominated by the agricultural industry. By the late 1900s, resource extraction led our state’s economy. In this new century, we must choose to take advantage of what comes next. Be it new energy, data and computing, advanced manufacturing or something else entirely, we must recognize that the Wyoming of a century ago is not the Wyoming of today. We should love our past, appreciate it and recognize that it is where we came from, not where we are going.
Many wish that Wyoming would not change. Most of us live here because we have chosen it. We love it as much for its hardships as its benefits, and many are uncomfortable with the possibility that the things we have always associated with our state may be replaced. We must remember, however, that we are a frontier state. The people who came here did so because it was a land of opportunity. We did not have “legacy” industries to fall back on. They came here because it was a place that valued growth, building something great and an entrepreneurial spirit. I fear we are losing the spirit of our heritage by focusing too much on what they built rather than on what we can build.
Today, there are many opportunities that our state could take advantage of. Alternative energy production would be well-suited to Wyoming, if we welcome it. Data centers are already a blossoming industry in some parts of the state and have the potential to inject millions of dollars into our communities through both employee salaries and tax revenue. Our workforce is well-suited to advanced manufacturing, as evidenced by companies like Maven, Weatherby and others intentionally locating themselves in Wyoming. Each of these has the potential to transform our communities for the better, but we must remember that transformation inherently means change. Our state will not look the same in the future, sometimes literally. Each new industry will bring with it opportunities and challenges. Nevertheless, we must be willing to take those challenges on.
Wyoming is not a place stuck in time. We are not immune to the outside world’s impact. We cannot keep Wyoming the way it used to be, because the things that drove that world are no longer the same. Our state’s history is full of people who came here to build something new. Our heritage is based on seizing opportunities. Let’s focus on that part of who we are, so that the Wyoming of tomorrow is just as good as the Wyoming of yesterday.

The committee also took up a constitutional amendment proposal to forbid the government from shutting down places of worship during a state of emergency. 
New requirements for credit card political donations
Sen. Cory Tomczyk (R-Mosinee) said his bill creating new requirements for political donations made with a credit card online will  ensure there is a “good, secure” process in place in Wisconsin. 
“Let’s acknowledge that we need to know that unlawful sources and foreign entities are not infiltrating our campaigns and elections,” Tomczyk said, and that “citizens are funding candidates here in Wisconsin.”
The bill, SB 403, would prohibit a political committee, political party or conduit from accepting contributions that are made with a credit card online unless the contributor provides their credit card verification value (CVV) or code and the billing address associated with the card is located in the United States. 
If a U.S. citizen is living outside the country and wants to make a contribution from a credit card that doesn’t have a U.S. billing address, then the person would need to provide a mailing address used for voter registration. 
“I’m trying to make elections more secure, the donation process more secure,” Tomczyk said. 
The bill comes as Republicans and the Trump administration have targeted ActBlue — a Massachusetts-based platform that processes donations to Democratic campaigns — claiming that the platform facilitates so-called “smurfing,” a form of money laundering where large sums of money are broken down into smaller, less noticeable transactions and could allow for “straw donors” and foreign contributions. Stakeholders, including ActBlue and Democrats, have said that the action by the administration is an attack on the democratic process.
Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, in his position as chair of the U.S. House Committee on House Administration, launched an investigation into ActBlue asking whether it required CVV information from contributors in 2023. 
The company said at the time that while it did not, it has many other measures in place to confirm the permissibility of contributions and prevent fraudulent transactions including a requirement for passport information if a donor provides an address outside the U.S. 
Steil has since proposed federal legislation that would require credit card verification for online donations. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) expressed concerns over how the bill could create barriers for individuals looking to contribute.
“Why are you trying to ban citizens from being able to donate by credit card?” Larson asked. 
“If they’re not open in the United States, they’re allowed to donate by credit card if they’re providing all the information that the bill outlines. If they don’t have a voting address, it’s kind of odd,” Tomczyk replied. “I’m pretty sure it’d be a pretty small amount of people.”
The authors of the bill also said people could still donate by check and other methods if they didn’t have the necessary information. 
“It sounds like this is just putting up additional hurdles for people who want to donate by credit card and it just seems like, especially for smaller dollar donations, people who aren’t writing a lot of checks,” Larson said. “Most of the people that I know are giving with credit cards because they don’t use checks.”
Larson said the bill could make it harder for people to participate in democracy through political contributions. 
The authors of the bill claimed there have been examples of “smurfing” in Wisconsin, though they provided no specific examples when asked. 
“This is not something that comes up out of the blue. People have been interviewed about contributions that they gave with their credit card that they said they never gave,” Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville) said. 
“You guys sound like Gargamel as much as you’re talking about smurfing,” Larson said at one point, referring to the fictional antagonist in the Smurfs cartoon franchise. “Come up with an example. Give me some proof really if you want the governor to be able to sign it.”
“In testimony, I don’t think I have to show proof. I have to provide information and… get enough support to pass it through,” Tomczyk said. 
Providing information on constitutional amendments
Lawmakers are also proposing a way to ensure Wisconsin voters have information on the potential effects of constitutional amendments. 
SB 205 follows years of the Republican-led Legislature turning to constitutional amendment proposals as a way to make changes to law without going through Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The most recent constitutional amendment that was approved by voters enshrined voter identification requirements in law, and other amendment proposals are circulating this session, including one to restrict the governor’s partial veto power. 
The committee heard from Tomczyk and Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) on their bill, which seeks to provide information about constitutional amendments to voters ahead of elections. 
“I’ve heard from countless friends and constituents, even people with college degrees and professional titles, all who tell me that every time they vote on a constitutional amendment the wording on the ballot makes no sense to them,” Tomczyk said. “The legalese, if you will, that is used on the ballot, is of course necessary and should be presented, but for regular everyday residents of Wisconsin, it might as well be in a different language. There has to be a way to explain what these amendments do so that people know what they are voting for.” 
“This is only meant to inform voters better about what they are voting for or against,” Tomczyk said. 
The bill would require a notice to go to voters that would include the date of the referendum, the text of the ballot question, the plain language summary of current law, an explanation in plain language of a proposed constitutional amendment and an explanation in plain language of the effects of a “yes” versus a “no” vote.
O’Connor said the Legislative Reference Bureau, the nonpartisan agency that drafts bills and proposals for the Legislature, would be responsible for writing the information in a black box. 
“The black box we cannot touch as legislators,” O’Connor said. He added that the legislation is “non-partisan, bipartisan and voter focused.” 
While the bill only has Republican cosponsors, it advanced through the Assembly Campaigns and Elections committee unanimously with support from two Democratic lawmakers. The bill is also supported by the League of Women Voters, the ACLU of Wisconsin, Disability Rights Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. 
Places of worship constitutional amendment
The committee also took up Senate Joint Resolution 4, a constitutional amendment proposal that would prohibit the state from ordering the closure of places of worship during a state of emergency. 
This is the Legislature’s second consideration of the proposal, which was first introduced and passed by the Legislature during the 2023-25 session. 
The proposal was introduced in reaction to actions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic when Gov. Tony Evers’ administration declared a state of emergency. 
Evers’ initial “Safer at Home” order in March 2020 explicitly designated religious entities as essential, though it said any gatherings should include fewer than 10 people in a room or confined space at a time and that people needed to adhere to social distancing requirements as much as possible. It also advised and permitted places of worship to have drive-in services. 
Before the constitutional amendment proposal, Evers vetoed a bill in 2021 that would have prohibited local health officers from taking any action to close or forbid gatherings in places of worship to control outbreaks and epidemics of COVID-19. 
Tomczyk noted an incident at Pilgrim Lutheran Church in West Bend where a law enforcement officer showed up to shut down a service after a neighbor called in to report the gathering. According to a Wisconsin Public Radio report, the incident was a misunderstanding and the police department later apologized to the church.
“In America, in Wisconsin, law enforcement stopped the church service because the government decided that a virus was more important than the constitutional rights of Americans. That is unacceptable,” Tomczyk said. “Many people in our great state seek solace in times of difficulty within their church, synagogue, or other plates of worship. It is critical that we continue to protect every individual’s ability to gather and worship at the times when they rely on their faiths the most.” 
Larson asked Tomczyk whether he was open to holding a religious organization liable if people “get sick and die” because they decide to meet against the direction of a public health emergency.
“No,” Tomczyk replied. 
“So… if there is a deadly pandemic, people are dying… and their parishioners die, you are fine with those deaths?” Larson asked. 
“I’m supportive of people’s constitutional right to gather and to worship at the times that they choose and, and if they make that decision, God bless them,” Tomczyk said. 
According to the constitutional amendment draft, voters would be asked whether the state constitution should be “amended to prohibit the state or a political subdivision of the state from ordering the closure of, or forbidding gatherings in, places of worship in response to a state of emergency, including a public health emergency?”
The proposal received a hearing in the Assembly in May, but has not yet been voted on there. 
If the bill passes the Assembly and Senate this session, it would be placed in front of voters during the November elections in 2026 alongside a slate of other high-profile races, including the one for governor.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)When President Donald Trump took office in January for a second term, just two Tennessee sheriffs had entered voluntary agreements to assist the federal government in immigration enforcement. 
Tennessee is now one of a handful of states seeing the biggest expansion of immigration agreements in the nation, along with Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Virginia.
Today, 48 local and state law enforcement agencies in Tennessee have signed onto so-called 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. 
They include 38 county sheriffs’ office, three small-town police departments and five east Tennessee constable districts. Constable districts typically consist of one unsalaried individual who is paid fees to serve warrants. 
Two state agencies, the Department of Safety and Homeland Security and the Department of Corrections, have also entered into 287(g) agreements, extending immigration enforcement powers to designated state highway patrol officers and prison guards.

The rapid spread of ICE agreements significantly expands the reach of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement and deportation agenda into interior states like Tennessee, where an immigrants without legal status represent an estimated 2.2% of the population.
Proponents of the agreements say the force multiplier effect of 287(g) agreements, by enlisting police officers, state troopers, emergency management officials, jailers, constables and prison guards, enhance community safety and more broadly enforce the nation’s immigration laws. 
“I decided to do this as there is a right way to enter our country and a wrong way,” said Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt, who in 2019 initiated one of the state’s earliest existing agreements.
“It is a slap in the face for those who have been properly vetted and went through the naturalization process,” Holt emailed the Lookout.
But critics of 287(g) agreements have called them an ominous extension of Trump administration tactics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Memphis and elsewhere to rely on racial profiling to engage in widespread arrests and detentions of immigrants with no criminal records. 
Immigrant advocates have long criticized 287(g) agreements for racial profiling, redirecting police to engage in low-level immigration violations instead of community safety and tasking police officers with limited training to interpret complex immigration laws.
“The Trump administration has really converted most of government – most of Homeland Security and much of the Department of Justice – to do immigration enforcement,” said Lena Graber, senior staff attorney for Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which advocates for immigrant rights.
“Are we just outsourcing all of our local officials to the federal government and its agenda?” she said. 
‘Unprecedented reimbursement opportunities’
Tennessee agencies who have partnered with ICE in recent months may have powerful incentives.
ICE agreements in the past have come with no financial compensation beyond training provided by federal authorities and IT equipment allowing communication with federal immigration databases. 
But the Trump administration included $14 billion in federal funding in the Big Beautiful Bill Act in July to fund financial incentives for local and state law enforcement agencies who agreed to ink 287(g) deals by Oct. 1. 
They include full reimbursement for the annual salary, benefits and overtime for each 287(g) trained officer, $7,500 for laptops and cell phones per trained officer and up to $100,000 toward the purchase of agency vehicles.
Participating law enforcement agencies are also eligible for bonuses that range from $500 to $1,000 per officer based on meeting benchmarks for the “successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICDE’s mission to Defend the Homeland.”

“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” Madison Sheahan, ICE Deputy Director, said in a message to potential state and local partners. 
In September the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 330,000 officers across the nation, urged police departments to enter 287(g) agreements to take advantage of the unprecedented funding opportunities.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the amount or timing of potential reimbursements to Tennessee law enforcement agencies.
Tennessee lawmakers, in a special session that convened last year, also approved incentives for agencies that partner with ICE, offering $5 million in grants to local law enforcement agencies that enter 287(g) agreements. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Safety and Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the status of the grant distributions. 
Small town police to become immigration ‘task forces’
State and local law enforcement agencies can opt to enter one of three different model agreements with ICE.
They include a “jail enforcement” agreement that gives local officials the authority to investigate the immigration status of individuals who are already incarcerated.
A spokesperson for Rutherford County Sheriff Mike Fitzhugh, who faced community pushback when his county’s jail enforcement agreement was made public, stressed the work his deputies did would remain unchanged.
“He is entering a memorandum of understanding with ICE, a continuation of what the Rutherford County Adult Detention Center has done with ICE since 1996,” the spokesperson said. “This memo will allow the deputies to have access to a federal data base.”
Tennessee law already requires local jails to cooperate with ICE officials to verify the immigration status of individuals coming into custody.
A “warrant service officer” agreement allows jailers to serve immigration warrants that authorize the arrest of individuals for civil immigration violations on those in their custody.
Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

The “task force” model gives local and state law enforcement officers powers to enforce immigration law on routine patrols and traffic stops — the most expansive delegation of immigration enforcement powers.
Thus far, 12 Tennessee state and local law enforcement agencies have adopted the task force model, including the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which oversees the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
Other task force agreements with ICE include three constable districts in Bradley County, one constable district in Monroe County and one in Polk County. 
Constable districts consist of one elected official who serves as a process server for local courts. They are not required to have police training, but the jobs are often filled by former police officers.
Constables in Bradley, Monroe and Polk Counties did not respond to questions from the Lookout.
The Putnam County Sheriff, the Sevier County Sheriff, Sevierville Police, Sparta Police and the Mosheim Police Department, which operates a force of five people in a town of 2500 in rural northeast Tennessee, has also agreed to serve as a task force agency. 
Of the 48 law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements contacted by the Lookout, only the Rutherford and Greene County Sheriff’s offices responded.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Fred D. Thompson Federal Courthouse in downtown Nashville has been the scene of two high profile trials in 2025 with distinctly different outcomes.
During a four-week period in April and May, jurors heard arguments in the corruption trials of former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his one-time chief of staff, Cade Cothren. 
The two were found guilty of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering for their roles in creating a fake political consulting firm that they used to gain business from state lawmakers under fraudulent terms. 
After none of his former colleagues testified on his behalf, Casada was sentenced to three years in federal prison and a $30,000 fine, which seems to me like a pretty light sentence for betraying the public trust. 
In June, weeks after the Casada-Cothren trial ended, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, was hauled into the same courthouse to be tried for “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Same courthouse, different outcomes: Trials held weeks apart in Nashville’s Fred D. Thompson Federal Courthouse reveal a diametrically opposite standard of justice. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Contrast the disparate treatments the two face: Casada, who, as prosecutors pointed out, never expressed an ounce of regret for deceiving his colleagues — some of whom he had worked with for nearly two decades — gets to skate with a Nov. 6 pardon from President Donald Trump, no doubt thanks to a call to Trump from a powerful mutual friend. 
Abrego Garcia, originally from Venezuela, came to the U.S. without legal permission at age 16 in 2011 but was granted protection from deportation in 2019 due to the danger he would face from gang violence should he return.  
Now, the married father remains not only in custody but in a dreadful legal limbo, continuing to face what appear to be — no pun intended — trumped-up human smuggling charges that federal prosecutors say are tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop, charges which were only filed by the government in April, after he’d been erroneously deported. 
One can argue about the appropriateness of Abrego Garcia’s move to the U.S. without following legal channels, although I find it reasonable a 16-year-old might want to escape gang violence in his home country. But what’s not arguable is the injustice in him continuing to be prosecuted for a mistake Trump officials made in deporting him against court orders. 
Supporters of Casada and Cothren, who forged a fake name on an IRS document to form their business, claim the pair were unjustly targeted out of political motivations. 
Politico quoted an anonymous White House official accusing federal law enforcement of being too hard on the Tennessee twosome. 
“The Biden Department of Justice significantly over-prosecuted these individuals for a minor issue involving constituent mailers — which were billed at competitive prices, never received a complaint from legislators, and resulted in a net profit loss of less than $5,000,” the official said in a statement. “The Biden DOJ responded with an armed raid, perp walk, and suggested sentences exceeding 10 years — penalties normally reserved for multimillion dollar fraudsters.”
There’s a lot wrong with this statement, starting with the fact that the investigation into Phoenix Solutions and Casada — and a subsequent raid of he and Cothren’s offices and homes — came in Trump’s first term.
And while the pair did indeed see little in financial profits, the money isn’t the point. 
Glen Casada: The rise and fall of a House Speaker

Casada started the fake Phoenix Solutions only after being bounced as speaker of the House by legislators who had elected him to the role only eight months earlier, members of the Republican House Caucus who gave him a ‘no confidence’ vote. 
He earned their scorn for his heavy-handed leadership once elevated to speaker, spending funds to renovate his office, including installing white noise machines, paying Cothren nearly $200,000 annually and allowing Cothren to eavesdrop on meetings, hiring additional staff as “hall monitors” to keep tabs on Republican caucus members and keeping “bill kill” lists targeting legislation sponsored by House members from both parties. 
In 2020, after being stripped of his House speaker role, the Tennessee Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance — a bipartisan board — fined Casada $10,500 after an audit revealed he had failed to provide receipts for nearly $100,000 in expenditures for his political action committee.  
With Casada, corruption is not a bug but a feature. He hasn’t faced injustice: he’s faced no justice for his wanton misuse of public office.
Criminal justice advocates often speak of a two-tiered justice system in the U.S., but I argue differently. The justice system isn’t two-tiered: simply put, a comparison of these two cases shows the justice system is currently dead. 
When Casada, the man who once held the third-highest position of power in Tennessee, a man who held public office for more than 20 years, gets off with a get-out-of-jail-free pass and zero accountability, no other conclusion is suitable.

State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt said schools have lost 2.5% of their students in the past year.
The state’s enrollment is now 234,957 students for this current school year, Blatt shared on Wednesday during a state Board of Education meeting.
“Fifty-three of 55 of our districts did decrease in enrollment this year,” Blatt said, noting only Tyler and Doddridge counties had an increase in student population.
A new West Virginia enrollment report showed a 6.5% decline from when the state had 250,899 students in the 2021-22 school year.
School officials have pointed to the state’s ongoing population decline as a major reason for the enrollment drop.
“There’s declining enrollment in our state as a whole and that’s affecting our school systems,” Blatt said.
West Virginia experienced the sharpest student population decline in the nation from 2020 to 2024, a time period that included the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Multiple school districts have proposed school closures or consolidations this year. Last week, the Roane County Board of Education voted to close two elementary and middle schools at the end of the 2025-26 school year. The county plans to consolidate students into other nearby schools. The state Board of Education will have to approve the plan. 
Roane County School Board President Jeff Mace said funding was part of the problem, MetroNews reported. He said the state’s school funding formula needs to be modernized and should focus more on the needs of students rather than student enrollment.
“I believe if we don’t invest in our education, we’re just going to continue to drive all of our young people and our young talent out of the state and we’re going to prevent people from coming in,” Mace said. 
State school board President Paul Hardesty has already called on state lawmakers to fix the school funding formula during the next legislative session to prevent more school closures in the rural state. 
According to the state Department of Education, 16 public schools closed in 2024.
Micah Whitlow, director of the West Virginia Department of Education’s Office of School Facilities, said that counties are making these decisions “based on real problems.”
“These things aren’t done on a whim or they just woke up one day thinking about this. Some of them are staff shortages, finances, deteriorating facilities. Some of these it’s all those things together,” he said.
Expired pandemic relief funding and students opting out of public schools to use the state’s broad school voucher program – The Hope Scholarship – have also put a financial strain on public schools. Around 19,000 students are using the voucher program this school year, typically at private religious schools. 
The enrollment report showed that public schools served 477 students using the Hope Scholarship; students using the Hope program can pay to take public school classes. Public schools also served 1,336 Hope Scholarship students that were not funded, according to the report. 
More than 4,000 children are attending virtual schools, which are considered public schools in West Virginia. Most of those students are enrolled in virtual charter schools. The state’s number of charter students has increased since the 2023-24 school year when 2,270 were enrolled.
Overall, most West Virginia students continue to be served in public schools as leaders grapple with financial issues, which can lead to less staff in schools.
“We can say that 98.2% of our students are still served in our public schools,” Blatt said.

(Photo by Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images)At least five lawsuits are underway in West Virginia challenging the state mandate requiring vaccination of schoolchildren, which permits no religious exemptions. Protection of religion from government intrusion is a fundamentally serious matter, not a culture war issue. But so is the protection of our children against serious and sometimes fatal diseases. What is the way out of this?
The background
School attendance is mandatory for all children aged 6 to 17, but they must first be immunized against chickenpox, measles, mumps, polio and six other diseases. Medical exemptions are available, but West Virginia is the only state that has never allowed religious exemptions. Four other states have joined West Virginia in the last decade by eliminating religious exemptions. Public polling that shows large bipartisan majorities of West Virginians oppose religious exemptions.
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 3-15 of the West Virginia Constitution prohibit government action that infringes the free exercise of religion. A claim pending in West Virginia federal court alleges that the vaccine mandate violates the Free Exercise Clause. But the U.S. Supreme Court held as early as 1905 that vaccine mandates are constitutional, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond has specifically upheld the West Virginia vaccine mandate against a Free Exercise Clause challenge.
In 2023, the West Virginia Legislature enacted the Equal Protection for Religion Act. It provides that no state action may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion unless for a compelling governmental interest and using the least restrictive means. But neither the title nor the text of the act indicates that the purpose of the law is to override the vaccine mandate law.
In fact, the Legislature has refused several times to insert religious exemptions into the vaccine mandate, most recently during the 2025 session. Obviously, the Legislature did not think the 2023 act had added religious exemptions — otherwise a new law doing that would not have been necessary.
But this result was not satisfactory for Gov. Patrick Morrissey. He tried to create the law the Legislature rejected by issuing Executive Order 7-25. The order directs state health officials to establish a procedure for accepting “religious or conscientious” objections to “one or more vaccine” required by the vaccine mandate.
The governor can control state health officials. But he has no authority over the West Virginia Board of Education. That board has constitutional authority to determine the rules under which state schools will operate. The board of education voted in June 2025 to follow existing law, ignore and accept no religious exemptions.
The litigation
The main question in the lawsuits is whether the Equal Protection for Religion Act even applies to the vaccination mandate. Two judges, one in Berkeley County and one in Mineral County, have said that it does not. A judge in Raleigh County has said that it does.
The Raleigh County case, Guzman v. WV Board of Education, is the most important case because that judge has also certified a class of similarly situated plaintiffs around the state and his ruling on a permanent injunction, expected in late November, will bind everyone whose case has not already been decided.
The Berkeley County judge found that EPRA’s title reveals no purpose to amend other law. He noted that the West Virginia Constitution voids any purpose for a law not stated in its title. The judge also found that the state had a compelling interest in protecting student health and safety. If the plaintiffs didn’t want their children to be vaccinated they had other options for schooling such as private school or home school.
The Raleigh County judge went in the other direction. He argued that EPRA begins with the phrase “notwithstanding any other provision of law.” He ruled that this language “signals legislative intent to override any conflicting provisions.” But the authority cited by the judge actually found that “notwithstanding” language does not override an earlier statute unless the language of the new law is explicitly contradictory. That is not the case here. Nevertheless, he determined that EPRA applies to the vaccine mandate and issued a preliminary injunction allowing three children to attend school without vaccinations.
Some observations
The opinion of the Raleigh County judge is unusual, to say the least. He seems to be on a mission to create a back-door amendment to the law, although judges are supposed to interpret law not make it. The Legislature, which has the sole authority to make law, has repeatedly refused to create religious exemptions. If EPRA can override every compulsory law on religious grounds, what’s to stop it from overriding compulsory school attendance itself, or even paying taxes?
But political winds are blowing strongly from the right. The governor’s executive order was issued one day after he took office and assumes a muscular, unitary executive power much like that employed by President Trump. The Guzman pleadings in Raleigh County are rife with political innuendo. They call West Virginia a “radical outlier” among states for having no religious exemptions. They claim that West Virginia is trying to align itself with “liberal” states like Connecticut and New York, when in fact those states have moved their law toward ours. No wonder, since West Virginia’s vaccine coverage of schoolchildren is the highest in the nation.
Non-traditional or philosophical beliefs can qualify as religious beliefs if they hold an important place in the person’s life. But even so, EPRA would not protect ornery libertarianism – a belief that the government can’t mandate an individual to do anything. And it would not protect the belief that vaccinations are ineffective or even harmful, ideas promoted by the questionable MAHA views of leading federal health officials.
Yet the exemption procedure ordered by the governor asks no questions. That could vastly expand the number of unvaccinated children who can attend school under a religious exemption, when the underlying objection may not be religious at all. As of October 2025, the Department of Health has granted all 575 religious exemptions requested for the 2025 school year — and denied none. This large number dwarfs the number of medical exemptions granted.
This religious exemption dispute is, in its purest form, the classic struggle between the interests of the whole society and the individual within. It has played out in American history many times. Both sides in the dispute have legitimate points and it will require the Supreme Court of Appeals to sort through them. But it is hard to imagine a purpose more compelling than the protection of the health and safety of schoolchildren. And the vaccine mandate — without religious exemptions –has done an admirable job of that for 120 years.

(Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance)Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has positioned himself as a friend of labor as he seeks the office of governor in 2026, but his past dealings with unions when he headed up the Detroit Medical Center shows he had fraught relationships with workers attempting to organize and seeking equal pay.
Duggan, running now as an independent candidate after being a lifelong Democrat, will undoubtedly need to court labor constituents as much as he’ll need a lift from big business if he wants to pull votes from the inevitable major party nominees next year.
Union support in the Michigan gubernatorial race is a must grab for any candidate, especially Democrats who rely on union campaign infrastructure and independents carving out a slice of the pie. That’s mostly because the labor density is higher in Michigan than most states, said Adrian Hemond, CEO of the bipartisan Grassroots Midwest political consulting firm. Middle-aged and older voters also have witnessed the benefits of union labor and representation in a profound way, affecting the livelihoods of their friends and neighbors, Hemond said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Thus far, Duggan has been able to pull some of those unions away from Democratic frontrunner and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, based on his years as mayor and the progress of the city under his watch, which saw few bumps in the road between his administration and the unions that represent the city.
Benson, Duggan duke it out for Teamsters nods in gubernatorial race

But Duggan’s union support in his gubernatorial bid has been met with skepticism from other trade unionists who instead are supporting Benson, and those who said they remember Duggan’s history before his time as mayor.
Among them: Nurses who worked at the medical center and tried to organize a new bargaining unit against pushback from Duggan’s administration; and Teamsters representing medical lab workers, who waged legal battles against   Duggan to equalize pay rates for women and minorities during contract negotiations.
Michigan Advance looked at Duggan’s history with the hospital system, which began in 2004 and ended in 2012. That included reviewing archived news articles and statements from the Michigan Nurses Association, which the Detroit nurses attempted to join. The Advance also interviewed nurses, their advocates and other union members who say Duggan’s efforts blocked   health system nurses from forming a new bargaining unit.
Michigan Advance also attempted to interview Duggan for this story. His campaign did not make him available. 
In a statement to the Advance, campaign spokesperson Andrea Bitely said Duggan has had the overwhelming support of labor in every election he has run, going back to his successful race for Wayne County prosecutor in 2000 and the three mayoral wins, starting in 2013.
“Mike Duggan’s track record with labor is so strong that in 2025, as an independent, he is publicly supported by 12 labor unions — more than all three Democratic candidates combined,” Bitely said. “From carpenters, to police officers, to truck drivers, to EMTs, plumbers and electrical workers, union workers are strongly backing his candidacy.”
Union support tempered by past clashes with hospital nurses
Duggan has garnered union support in his bid for governor, including from Michigan Teamsters Joint Council 43, which represents more than 30,000 workers in the transportation, warehouse, manufacturing and construction sectors, and the Detroit police and fire unions that worked with Duggan as mayor for more than a decade.
Although the Detroit Medical Center allegations were not new, taken together, they paint a picture of Duggan’s early career reluctance to accept or support union activity.
Several former employees or those working with them on the effort told the Advance that Duggan’s administration at the hospital system suppressed organizing activity through surveillance, retaliation, interrogations, banning pro-union literature, and attempts to reclassify nurses as supervisors to disqualify them from the union vote.
The nurses in 2007 said they were primarily concerned about unsafe staffing ratios that affected patient care and the quality of their own work at the Detroit Medical Center. Some reached out to Duggan’s administration in hopes management would address the issue, including now retired nurse Pat Cason-Merenda.

She said Duggan and his administration would not listen to them, so they started making moves to join the Michigan Nurses Association. That led to a wave of anti-union posturing from the hospital system, and complaints to the National Labor Relations Board.
Archived stories in the now-defunct Michigan Citizen, a weekly, Black-owned progressive newspaper in Detroit, reported that nurses testified that employees suspected of organizing were subject to intimidation and disciplinary action, including being written up for handing out organizing materials or interrogated about organizing activity.
Merenda said some nurses leading the drive were brought up on disciplinary charges for what she claimed were insignificant things; solely as an attempt to quell the effort or harass union-curious nurses.
Copies of some of the flyers nurses said the medical center used to deter them  from organizing were also obtained by the Advance. One with a DMC Children’s Hospital of Michigan letterhead asked nurses to “know your facts” about “daily life under a contract.” It warned that last minute requests for time off due to family needs or schedule changes could be compromised, and predicted mandated overtime and seniority job bidding quirks.

Public pressure did not move hospital officials in nurse union fight
Tova Perlmutter, the former executive director of the Detroit-based Sugar Law Center, which focuses on workers’ rights for nonunionized people, confirmed for the Advance that the law center was contacted to help battle those counter measures and put public pressure on Duggan and the medical center to let the nurses organize without interference.
Part of that work involved showing up to the hospital to demand meetings with members of the administration or their board of trustees in hopes they could work out the differences and foster an environment that would help a would-be nurses’ union flourish. They were often denied meetings, Perlmutter said, with hospital administrators, Duggan or board members.
“I remember leaving with a sense of real frustration and that I was seeing how stonewalling could be really effective for corporations in ignoring community demand,” Perlmutter said.
Perlmutter and the Sugar Law Center distributed an open letter, signed by more than 30 Detroit area faith letters, to Duggan and the hospital system’s board asking them to respect the nurses’ wishes to build a union and to sign a fair election agreement. 
Perlmutter also corroborated Merenda’s claim that one of the nurses leading the charge was disciplined and silenced on unrelated workplace conduct allegations, and said that one of the group’s immediate demands was to be present during the disciplinary hearings, but were again denied.
A settlement was finally reached between the Detroit Medical Center and the Michigan Nurses Association in 2008, which gave the nurses the greenlight to begin forming a union. A copy of the settlement, which was not made public, was reviewed by the Advance. The settlement confirmed many of the allegations made by nurses during that time.
Prior to that settlement, the national labor board, in an unrelated ruling, declared that supervising charge nurses could not be considered members of a non-supervisory nurses’ bargaining unit. Perlmutter said that some hospitals around the nation took that as an avenue to make anyone who was eligible to be a charge nurse a supervisor as a way to thin the herd of potential bargaining members.
Marenda said that the medical center employed that strategy as a way to turn the nurses against one another as they sought to organize. The move also prevented the two sides from reaching a fair election agreement in 2007.
Mayoral campaigns denied Duggan employed union-busting tactics 
In 2010, Duggan and the administration were making moves to transform the hospital system from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit operation by selling it to Vanguard Health Systems. Two years later, he resigned from his post at the Detroit Medical Center and was gearing up to run for mayor.
But Duggan’s difficulty with the nurses became a campaign issue, which came to the fore in a 2012 interview on First Shift with Tony Trupiano, a progressive radio talk show. 

https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MallettTrupiano.mp3
 
Conrad Mallet, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court and the current city of Detroit corporation counsel, was one of the DMC’s top administrators during Duggan’s time and later served as his campaign committee chairman. He denied that the medical center had engaged in union-busting tactics while Duggan led the system, and that the organizing effort was not homegrown, but rather imported from California.
The Michigan Nurses Association issued a lengthy news release countering those claims shortly thereafter.
 


It wasn’t just the nurses who had issues with Duggan. Teamsters Local 283 represents the Detroit Medical Center’s lab assistants, and continued to fight against the health system over its contracts after Duggan left. Steve Hicks, president of Teamsters Local 283, said Duggan’s relationship with the local was fraught, especially when it came to equalizing the pay for a Black lab assistant who was making less than her peers.
“People who were African American that worked a long time were making low wages,” Hicks said. “They were hiring white women in for like, $4 and $5 more an hour. We had 200 lab assistants, all of who were making different amounts of money. [Duggan] said he would never equalize the pay.”
Hicks said it took the Teamsters three contracts to eventually do that, but it was not without struggle from Duggan, who again was reluctant to do so.
Those battles with labor during his time at the Detroit Medical Center led labor unions like the UAW, the AFL-CIO and one council of AFSCME workers to support former Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon when he ran against Duggan in 2013 as a write-in candidate.
That included Hicks who told the Advance that he didn’t believe – then or now – that Duggan aligned with basic Democratic Party values that would make party fixtures, especially those in the labor movement, want to vote for him.
John Armelagos, who was the president of the Michigan Nurses Association during Duggan’s time at Detroit Medical Center, said the same.
“I don’t know how any bona fide trade unionist could support Mike Duggan for any office in lieu of the vicious anti-union campaign that was conducted at DMC while he was CEO,” Armelagos said.
Despite the opposition from labor, Duggan ascended to the frontrunner in the race and won. He remained mayor for more than 10 years. In 2017, when he launched his first reelection bid, AFSCME Council 25 issued sweeping support for Duggan, citing him as the best choice to create jobs and opportunities for working people in Detroit.
Lawrence Roehrig, the president of AFSCME Council 25, said then in a statement supporting Duggan that they were excited for another four years of Duggan’s time as mayor. But the split between AFSCME members was palpable. 
In a column by The Detroit News’ Bankole Thompson, Roehrig’s immediate predecessor, Al Garrett, told the newspaper that he would not have endorsed Duggan if he had still been heading up the council, even if it was clear that Duggan would be the most likely winner. Garrett said then he felt that unions were rallying around him for access more than anything, and that he didn’t have his best interests at heart.
The Metro Detroit AFL-CIO rebuffed some of Garrett’s commentary, saying they had seen progress in the city and were ready to support him in his second bid for mayor.
Could past union struggles help Duggan as an independent candidate?
Duggan’s past struggles with unions at the Detroit Medical Center may have an impact on his ability to court additional unions or labor-oriented voters.
Hemond said Duggan will need labor endorsements to signal to Democrats of certain stripes that it is OK to vote for him over whomever is the likely Democratic nominee, which could be Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist or Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson.
But Hemond said Duggan only needs a slice of the Michigan union political machine rather than the whole pie.
“We’ve seen in the last couple presidential elections, the last three, really, in this state, that there are a lot of union members that have voted for [President] Donald Trump,” Hemond said. “Those folks have a positive view of their union. They continue to be members. But the Democratic Party has lost them in some other respects, and that’s an important sort of swing constituency in this state.”

Of note, when Trump performed best with those folks, he won Michigan, Hemond added.
Duggan may be reading the room for that sentiment in his own bid, seeing an opportunity with swing-voting unionists who may no longer be buying what the Democrats are selling. Hemond said it would be a mistake for the Democrats in the race, namely Benson, to assume that union members still vote – and endorse – as a monolith.
“That has clearly changed, not just in Michigan, by the way, but it’s more important in Michigan, because there are just more union members and there’s more union history here,” Hemond said. “A UAW member from Macomb County looks a lot different from an MEA member from Alpena County; they look a lot different than a building trades guy from the Sioux. Duggan is trying to take advantage of that and go after what he views as the most gettable labor union members.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Advocates and lawmakers packed a room at the Capitol Wednesday for a listening session hosted by WISDOM, a statewide network of faith-based social justice organizations, to discuss immigration, criminal justice, housing and environmental policy. Participants said they hoped hearing personal stories would move lawmakers beyond “political posturing” and inspire change.
“It’s been almost nine years since I was last charged with anything,” said Jessica Jacobs, a formerly incarcerated woman who was one of the first to speak. “I’ve rebuilt my life, I’ve stayed in recovery, and I’ve dedicated myself to helping others do the same. But my criminal record still follows me, especially when it comes to finding a place to live.” Jacobs said that every time she pays a non-refundable fee only to fail a background check for housing, she’s reminded “that society hasn’t fully forgiven me, even though I’ve done everything I can do to make things right.”
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
When Jacobs was released from prison in 2010, she was placed in a transitional living program. It should have been a second chance, but it wasn’t because that apartment complex was in the very same neighborhood where she would get the substances she used. “It was a setup for failure,” said Jacobs, adding that women and men all over Wisconsin have similar experiences. “Imagine being locked up, and all you can imagine is being with your children again. You count the days dreaming about that reunion. But when you’re finally released, you find out that you can’t get housing that will allow your children to live with you. The pain doesn’t just stop with the mother, the children suffer, too. Families stay separated not because of lack of love or effort, but because there’s nowhere safe and stable for them to go home to.”
Jacobs finally found a landlord who was also in recovery, and could empathize with her situation. “No one’s success story should depend on luck,” she said. “When people don’t have housing, we see the same cycles of recidivism repeat and repeat. Without a place to live, it’s almost impossible to look for a job, maintain recovery, or reunite with your children and family. We say that we want people to come home and be better. But how can they if we won’t give them a place to call home?”
Crystal Keller, a member of the group My Way Out, shared  the struggle incarcerated mothers have in Wisconsin. Keller’s daughter is locked up at the Taycheedah Correctional Institution, where she will be for two years. Keller pointed to a 1991 Wisconsin law that says that incarcerated mothers should be housed with their babies until they turn 12 months old. Yet Keller’s daughter has never been offered access to that program, despite having a two-month-old when she was sentenced. “The program was allocated $198,000 per year,” Keller said. “Where is that money? That’s $6.7 million in the 35 years that they’ve never offered it.” 
Keller said that the Department of Corrections claims to offer the program for women who are out in the community. “That’s a lie,” said Keller. “…when are they going to start complying with the law?” Keller said that when her daughter was sent to Taycheedah, she was placed in restrictive housing for the first six months. “And it took them a month to pick her up from the county jail,” said Keller. “She was not allowed to hold her son for seven months, from two months old until just last month.” Keller’s family would travel from Milwaukee to Fond du Lac just to do hour-long video visits. “Often, visits would get cancelled…Why do I even need to go there?” 
Just last Sunday during a visit, Keller said that another family was told by a correctional officer that they weren’t allowed to even play hand-clapping games with their children. “It’s disgusting, it needs to stop, and DOC who punishes people for breaking the law has been breaking the law for 35 years.” 
Attendees drew attention to other conditions endured by people held in Wisconsin’s prisons and jails. Randy Gage, a member of WISDOM’s Solitary & Conditions of Confinement Task Force, who also has a background in psychology and experience working in prisons in both Georgia and Wisconsin. “Segregation is not the best way to go,” said Gage. “We went through a long period starting around the 1980’s of ‘get tough on crime’. Enough already with getting tough on crime! Enough!” Gage said that when he was growing up in Milwaukee, he didn’t have to worry about things like gun violence. “That didn’t happen, and that was before ‘get tough on time’. Since ‘get tough on crime’ all of this is going on? Don’t tell me it works. No, it doesn’t work.” 
Advocates also discussed Act 196, a bipartisan law that favors short-term sanctions for probation and parole violations like a weekend stint in jail, treatment program or community service over total revocation back to prison. “For more than a decade, the DOC has resisted implementing this law that could’ve reduced and stabilized our prison population,” said Tom Gilbert, a member of MOSES. “Finally in June of this year, the DOC issued proposed rules, but they are an extreme disappointment.” Although the proposed rules adopted some features of the law, they do not establish “a system of short-term sanctions,”, said Gilbert, saying that the DOC is choosing to keep a system that “sabotages” people’s chances of returning home rather than promoting healing. “It would save millions of taxpayer dollars spent on needless incarcerations,” said Gilbert. “Those dollars could be re-directed to proven, successful programs such as treatment programs and diversions.” 
Others pushed for restoring voting rights to formerly incarcerated people, which is already law in 25 states. Jeremy Dings, a formerly incarcerated member of WISDOM’s Post-Releases Issues Task Force, said that he has not been able to vote in eight election cycles because even though he has been  back in the community for 13 years. Dings said that democracy is strongest when it includes everyone’s voice, and that such a policy change would help people transition and feel like active, valued members of the community.

Restoring drivers licenses for immigrants was also discussed by immigrant rights advocates and dairy farmers. People in mixed-status families take great risk to perform simple tasks like driving to work, or dropping their children off at school, they said. “This is not just about paperwork,”  said Grace Mariscal, a student at St. John’s Northwestern Academies. “This is about parents being able to drive their children to school safely, or go to a doctor’s appointment, without fear.” 
Mariscal said that 19 other states have passed laws that allow members of mixed-status families to have drivers licenses, policies which reduce hit-and-run accidents, increase state revenue, and reduced law enforcement costs. “These reforms would also strengthen Wisconsin’s economies,” said Mariscal. “Our dairy farms, our factories, our restaurants, our food processing plants all depend on immigrant labor. By allowing workers to drive legally, we help businesses maintain stable workforces, and ensure that the industries that feed and sustain our state continue to thrive.”
The rights of nature was also discussed, with advocates pushing for laws that establish personhood for natural habitats, rivers, forests and other ecosystems. “It really comes out of Indigenous values,” said Jim Goodman, a member of Family Farm Defenders. “It is an international movement.” Goodman pointed out that in America, even corporations are given personhood. So why not the ecosystems and natural environments that all things, human or otherwise, depend on? Goodman also advocated for policies to require sulfide mines to prove that they won’t be harmful to the environment before digging begins, and new protections for Devil’s Lake State Park. “Wisconsin has a long history of environmental stewardship”, said Goodman, pointing out that former Wisconsin Gov.  Gaylord Nelson was the founder of Earth Day. 
Advocates also discussed closing the prison in Green Bay, and granting parole to older incarcerated people who were sentenced when they were young. Some in the room condemned Gov. Tony Evers for using his veto power to remove a deadline to close Green Bay Correctional, and pointed to the fact that the Lincoln Hills juvenile prison is still open despite plans to build new prisons to replace the aging and controversial facility. 
Several lawmakers including Reps. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee), Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), and new legislators including Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) and Karen DeSanto (D-Baraboo) said  hearing stories like those shared Wednesday are crucial for their work.
“Remember the folks that are not here,” said Madison, who told an emotional story about his brother and friends who struggled with mental illness, suicidal thoughts, and incarceration. “Give your anger to those folks, channel your grief towards those folks, because it’s a damn shame that they’re not here.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3804-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-13 06:56:41.911236

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state lawmakers in charge of writing the state’s budget questioned Gov. Jared Polis’ proposal to fund Medicaid less than its projected growth over the upcoming fiscal year.
“The Medicaid cuts here are particularly large. Given the scope of Medicaid in our budget, it’s not an unreasonable approach,” Sen. Jeff Brides, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said during Polis’ presentation of his budget proposal to the Joint Budget Committee on Wednesday. “It is concerning to see, and I want to know what you’ve done to ensure that these reductions are targeted and minimize impact on accessibility in the state.”
Polis said he does not characterize his plan as cutting Medicaid, but as a reduction in how fast the program for low-income Coloradans grows. The program is projected to grow nearly 12% next fiscal year, which begins in July, which would require a budget increase of about $630 million. Instead, he wants the Legislature to approve a budget that would only allow Medicaid spending to grow by about $300 million.

“This isn’t a trim,” said Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican. “It’s a blow to families who are already fighting to get care. These numbers represent real people.”
Medicaid is responsible for more and more of the budget each year, now up to about one-third. The state’s spending power is constrained by the growth of inflation and population due to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, so ballooning Medicaid costs have forced budget writers to cut other program spending.
“We want any item that grows faster than other items to be one you look at with a magnifying glass and demand better outcomes and better results,” Polis said.
Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat, suggested that the state needs to take steps to rightsize Medicaid utilization, so clients are getting care “at the right place, at the right time and at the right level of care.” Medicaid costs are determined by utilization and provider rates, and Polis recently signed an executive order to reverse a provider rate increase to address a budget shortfall.
“What we end up doing, for the most part, is not actually attacking utilization, but attacking the rates at which we pay providers,” Brown said.
Polis and Mark Ferrandino, the director of the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting, said an anticipated analysis on Colorado’s Medicaid program from a third-party firm will give insight into how the state compares nationally and what policy changes could be helpful long-term.
The Joint Budget Committee is in charge of writing the state’s annual budget, which is constitutionally required to be balanced. The governor submits an initial proposal in November and another in January. The Legislature typically debates and votes on the budget in March.
The state is also preparing to implement new Medicaid eligibility work requirements by 2027, which Ferrandino said could cost upwards of $5 million.
“That could get us a good start to get it implemented, but we are waiting on (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to give us that guidance,” he said. “That could change significantly what the requirements would be.”

(Photo of Martin Administrative Building, City of Martin Facebook)The Weakley County Grand Jury on Monday indicted Martin, Tenn. Mayor Randal “Randy” Brundige and two other city officials, one of them the mayor’s daughter, for using public funds for travel, meals and, in one case, to funnel money into a personal consulting firm.
Investigators for the Tennessee Comptroller’s Office found Randy Brundige and Bradley “Brad” Thompson, director of Economic and Community Development, used a city-issued credit card at high-end restaurants for meals and alcohol while traveling on city business, once spending $673 on a meal for the pair in 2021. 
The approved state rate for meal reimbursement at the time was $61 per day.
Comptroller’s investigators reviewed documents over a 10-year period from Feb. 1, 2015 to June 13, 2025 and accused Mayor Brundige of misappropriating at least $10,900.

Thompson, who owns a firm called One Consulting, billed the city for grant-writing and administrative services performed by the firm that were already part of his official duties. According to a Comptroller’s report, Thompson misappropriated $274,000 via One Consulting. Brundige approved all payments to One Consulting without a contract between the firm and the city.
Thompson also used a city credit card for luxury travel, including a trip to Italy.
“This case is troubling because it involves a sitting mayor and a senior city official,” said Comptroller Jason Mumpower. “City officials must ensure strong internal controls are in place to protect public funds including monitoring credit card use, enforcing travel policies, and reviewing employee timesheets.”
Randy Brundige’s daughter, Natalie Brundige, who was custodian for the Martin Police Department, where her duties were described as sweeping, mopping, dusting and emptying trash cans, earned $174,000 in salary, leave, and benefits. Evidence showed she routinely worked only about two hours of her scheduled eight-hour shifts over a six-year period. 
Randy Brundige was indicted on four counts of theft of property over $60,000, one count of accessory after the fact, one count of theft of property over $10,000, and four counts of official misconduct. Thompson was indicted on one count of theft of property over $60,000, four counts of official misconduct, and one count of theft of property over $10,000.
The grand jury indicted Natalie Brundige on one count of theft of property over $60,000 and one count of official misconduct.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Mike Simpson is one of Rhode Island’s biggest cheerleaders for hemp cultivation and the plant’s derivative products — remedies, he believes, that may help where pharmaceutical medicines cannot. 
It’s that very reason Simpson helped co-found Rhode Island’s only outdoor hemp farm, where he says many of the business’ products ship all across the country.
But Lovewell Farms’ may cease operations now that Congress has approved reopening the federal government under legislation that would effectively ban hemp products containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC. If approved by President Donald Trump, the ban will go into effect in a year. 

“This might be the final straw,” Simpson said in an interview Wednesday. “I may have to shut my whole company down.” 
Simpson doesn’t sell intoxicating products, but said crops grown at his Hopkinton farm can contain up to 1 milligram of THC in it, as is allowed under existing Rhode Island hemp regulations.
“I have 700 to 800 pounds of flower that I grew this year that under that law would not be legal,” he said.
Simpson said he would grow crops with lower concentrations, but as a USDA-certified organic farm, there aren’t that many seed suppliers he can buy from.
“We’re really at the whim of what those folks are providing,” he said.
The provision in the shutdown-ending appropriations bill was championed by GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in order to close a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp but inadvertently paved the way for the proliferation of hemp-derived THC products like infused drinks — products which states have since scrambled to either regulate or ban.
THC drinks derived from hemp were illegal in Rhode Island until August 2024, when the state’s now-defunct Office of Cannabis Regulation began allowing the sale of products containing low levels of delta-9 THC at licensed retailers, including vape shops and liquor stores.
The presence of hemp-derived drinks has led to a debate on whether such drinks should even be legal in Rhode Island. Members of the state’s recreational cannabis industry for the most part have been against allowing THC products to be sold outside licensed pot shops. 
Since the start of the fiscal year on July 1, regulators in the newly-established Rhode Island Cannabis Office have crafted recommendations on dosage limits, packaging standards, labeling requirements, licensing conditions, and other ways to ensure children don’t accidentally consume the intoxicating drinks. 
Cannabis Control Commission spokesperson Charon Rose said the regulators are aware of recent federal developments concerning hemp and hemp-derived products and are monitoring the situation. 
“At this time, it is too soon to determine what impact these developments may have on Rhode Island,” she said in an email. “We remain committed to keeping stakeholders and the public informed as more information becomes available.”
But Nicholas Fede Jr., executive director for the Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative, warns the ban could cause major disruptions in the growing beverage market. That will especially be the case should the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice decline to reclassify cannabis at the federal level. The feds still consider marijuana a Schedule I drug, meaning it’s subject to the strictest federal controls, which limit interstate distribution. 
“That would upend how it comes to market in our state,” Fede said in an interview. “All of a sudden we couldn’t take credit cards for these items, we would have separate bank accounts.”
Fede said the best path forward is to establish clear regulations for hemp-infused drinks while allowing liquor stores to continue selling them.

“We’ve proven for 100 years we can regulate intoxicating products very well,” he said.
A “nefarious misinterpretation”
Kentucky’s other Republican U.S. senator, Rand Paul, attempted to strip the last-minute hemp language from the federal funding bill through an amendment on Monday, but his effort failed on a 76-24 vote. 
Rhode Island’s Democratic Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse voted in favor of McConnell’s restrictions, though their offices noted the senators ultimately opposed the final budget bill.
“At the urging of the vast majority of the state attorneys general, they voted to table an amendment to strip this provision,” their offices said in an emailed statement to Rhode Island Current.
They were referring to a letter sent to key members of Congress in October by 39 attorneys general, including Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, in which they urged lawmakers to close the THC loophole.
“Industry actors have nefariously misinterpreted the Farm Bill’s legalization of low concentrations of hemp-derived delta-9,” the AGs wrote. “These products are being sold nationwide without consistent age restrictions, labeling standards, or safety requirements and are frequently packaged as gummies, candies, and beverages designed to appeal to young children.”
By itself, hemp produces little to no THC, the compound most commonly associated with cannabis intoxication, and is typically non-psychoactive when first harvested, unlike other cannabis plants.
But its potency can be increased by chemistry. Methods include soaking the hemp material in a liquid like butane or ethanol, applying enough pressure and heat to extract delta-8 or delta-9 THC compounds, or exposing the plant to acid.
“This is not natural,” Stuart Procter, co-founder and lab director for cannabis testing facility PureVita Labs in West Warwick, said in an interview. “You cannot trust anything you buy in a shop right now.”
Which is why Procter said he’s in favor of banning psychoactive hemp products until there are firmer regulations and standards for products.
“The hemp bill was never designed to allow hemp-derived delta-9 THC to be sold on the open market,” he said.
But Simpson’s interpretation of the 2018 bill is that any rules surrounding new hemp products are up to the states, which he said Rhode Island did to ensure safer products.
“We have consumable licensing, products have to go through testing, display THC amounts,” he said. “If we want a free market economy, and this is open and available, we shouldn’t be penalizing or punishing the businesses.”

Years after the prolonged fight over the Colorado Department of Transportation’s widening of Interstate 70, CDOT is now proposing to widen Interstate 270.
Coloradans learned painfully from I-70: projects that expand highways in historically burdened neighborhoods don’t heal communities, they compound harm. But, apparently, CDOT did not learn from its past mistakes.
The most immediate concern is timing: the planned 60-day comment period for the project’s environmental review process — which begins Nov. 17 — falls over Thanksgiving, Hannukah, Christmas, the New Year, and other end-of-year holidays. CDOT has denied requests by GreenLatinos and other groups to delay this comment period, choosing to bulldoze ahead and force community members to defend their health and well-being during one of the busiest times of year. This decision reflects CDOT’s philosophy that community input is an afterthought. CDOT must delay the comment period, or it will further erode public trust and faith in our government.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Timing aside, widening I-270 is a bad idea. For more than a decade GreenLatinos and the residents of North Denver and Commerce City have been raising our voices for cleaner air and healthier neighborhoods. We’ve documented how highway traffic — especially in conjunction with nearby industrial facilities like the Suncor refinery — concentrates pollution in front-line communities, and we’ve pushed for transportation solutions that prioritize health, not mere vehicle throughput. As GreenLatinos’ community work and reports make clear, widening a highway that slices through these neighborhoods will only worsen the pollution burden that residents already shoulder.
That pollution burden matters. Asthma, cardiovascular disease, and other pollution-related illnesses are not abstract statistics for North Denver and Commerce City — they are daily realities. The settlement reached over I-70 included commitments to health studies and air monitoring because the I-70 expansion exposed gaps in how transportation impacts on community health were assessed and mitigated. If CDOT wished to put health first, it would shift away from road widening and toward strategies that reduce vehicle miles traveled, invest in clean transit, and protect the people who live closest to the freeway.
Colorado also has concrete climate goals that highway widening would directly undercut. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, and planners and advocates have repeatedly pointed out that adding lanes inevitably induces demand — more driving, more emissions, and more pollution dumped into vulnerable neighborhoods. Induced demand also means that adding a lane will not help with congestion. We cannot credibly meet 2030 and 2050 targets while building capacity that invites more tailpipe pollution. Policy and infrastructure must instead pull in the opposite direction, toward climate solutions.
There’s another practical problem with CDOT’s plans for I-270: cost. Colorado is facing significant budget pressures — from state revenue hits tied to federal changes to ongoing deficits — and yet CDOT is discussing multi-hundred-million-dollar to billion-dollar projects that lock in maintenance and environmental costs for decades. In a moment when state resources are scarce, we should be asking whether this is the highest and best use of public dollars. Investments in electrified transit, community health protection, and targeted industrial enforcement would deliver far greater returns for Coloradans.
Remember why Colorado created the Office of Environmental Justice and strengthened environmental justice processes in CDOT and state agencies: to prevent precisely this kind of proposal from steamrolling through without adequately protecting front-line communities. Those reforms came about because residents and organizations fought to make them real after the harms of past projects. If Colorado’s environmental justice commitments are meaningful, they must be more than checkbox language.  They should be a veto against proposals that increase pollution exposure and displacement risk for disproportionately burdened communities.
What comes next if we continue down this path? If CDOT’s core philosophy remains focused on moving cars rather than making people healthier, we will be replaying the same fights we saw with I-70: more lawsuits and more broken trust. But the state has tools to change course.  Rather than widening highways, it can and should prioritize zero-emission transit, congestion-fighting tools like differential tolling, and community-led health and safety improvements like green space and bike paths. Communities have been clear about what they need, and CDOT should listen.
CDOT’s mandate is to connect Colorado. That cannot mean sacrificing the health and futures of low-income and Latino communities to (in theory) save a few extra minutes of drive time. It must mean an approach that centers environmental justice, aligns with climate goals, protects public dollars, and restores trust in our government. And that starts with delaying the planned comment period to allow for adequate community engagement and meaningful consideration of alternatives.
If we’re serious about justice and climate, CDOT should be widening the path to a healthier, more equitable future — not I-270.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by by David Stephenson)Our representative democracy rests on a fundamental principle: We, the people, have a right to participate in decisions that affect us. 
In two prior reports, the League of Women Voters of Kentucky described how Kentucky’s General Assembly, in its 60-day legislative sessions, has increasingly fast-tracked legislation in ways that weaken that principle. 
In our newest report, “How Can They Do That? 2025 Challenges to Transparency and Citizen Participation in Kentucky’s Legislative Process,” we show that fast-tracking also occurred in 30-day legislative sessions. These fast-track maneuvers are often combined with other undemocratic tactics to create a negative, compounding effect on public participation. It is not uncommon for a bill to follow a process like this:

A “shell bill” is filed with a vague title and little or no substantive language, creating the opportunity for substantial changes to be inserted at the last minute.
The bill is given “readings” on the chamber floor before the committee discusses the bill. The public may not notice that this has happened, but the maneuver creates the opportunity to rush the bill to a floor vote after the committee approves it. 
The committee calls a meeting outside its regularly scheduled meeting time to consider the bill, with short notice to the public that it is meeting at a different time.
At the committee hearing, the original bill is replaced with a substitute version that the public has not seen and cannot access prior to the committee discussion. 
The committee approves the substitute bill and sends it to the full House or Senate for a vote that very day, allowing the public only a couple of hours to contact their legislators about the bill. 
No minutes of the committee meeting are posted, leaving no public record of committee discussions and public testimony on the bill.

Senate Bill 202, passed in the 2025 session, was one of many bills that used these tactics. The bill was introduced as a five-page shell bill filed on the bill filing deadline. It made two minor wording changes to existing law: changing e-mail to email and Web site to website. In its final form, the bill expanded to 28 pages that added new rules on a substantive issue (the distribution and sale of cannabis-infused beverages). These changes were accomplished by pulling the bill for floor readings before committees discussed the bill, then introducing substitute versions of the bill and moving it to floor votes within 24 hours. No minutes of these committee meetings were posted, leaving no record of committee discussion or public testimony. This process left little time for those affected by the new language to understand and give input on the bill.
As in our prior reports, the 2025 report recommends to the General Assembly specific ways to give the people time to understand and give input on bills before voting on them. Those recommendations include posting draft legislation before each session, limiting the use of shell bills, allowing time for the public to review changes made to bills before a vote is taken, transacting most committee business during regularly scheduled meetings, and posting timely records of legislative proceedings.  
The League of Women Voters of Kentucky supports informed and active citizen participation in government. We remind our elected officials that they work for the people, were elected to represent the people, and must give the people opportunities to understand and give input on legislation that affects us.

In addition to the regularly scheduled November 2026 elections, in which Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton will each seek another term, some Central Arkansas and River Valley voters will head to the polls for a special election earlier in the year.
For now, the House District 70 and Senate District 26 special elections are scheduled for June 9, 2026. Voters in both districts are suing to move the elections forward in hopes of having representation during the April 2026 legislative fiscal session, where funding for a proposed state prison will be up for debate.
Both seats became vacant in September after Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch died and Republican Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock resigned.
Five Republicans are vying for their party’s nomination to succeed Stubblefield: former Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark, Wade Dunn and Stacie Smith of Greenwood, and Brad Simon and Ted Tritt of Paris.

Stubblefield’s family has endorsed Dunn, who told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette he will “tirelessly” continue Stubblefield’s opposition to Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. Smith, Tritt and Simon have also said they oppose the prison plan.
Adam Watson of Branch, one of the prison’s most vocal opponents, also filed to run for the Senate seat. As an independent, he will forgo the primary and automatically advance to the general election.
District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
In Pulaski County’s House District 70, Wing’s 2024 Democratic opponent has filed to run for the seat again. Alex Holladay of North Little Rock will face Cordelia Smith-Johnson of Sherwood in the primary. Bo Renshaw of North Little Rock is the only Republican running for the seat.
Last week, the Democratic Party of Arkansas and four District 70 voters asked a judge to hold Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester in contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order to set the district’s special election for March 3.
In October, another judge ordered the state to hold the Senate District 26 election “as soon as practicable.” The state has appealed the order.
For the regularly scheduled elections, the primary election for partisan races and the general election for nonpartisan judicial races will be March 3, 2026.
The general election for partisan races is Nov. 3. Runoff contests for the general election, if necessary, will be Dec. 1. Judicial runoffs will be on Nov. 3 if necessary.

Several Democrats running for Republican-held legislative seats have run before.
Democrat Dexter Miller of Helena-West Helena has challenged incumbent Rep. Mark McElroy, R-Tillar, in the Delta’s House District 62 twice. McElroy defeated Miller by 197 votes in 2022 and by 663 votes in 2024.
Miller filed on Monday to run for the seat for a third time. Unlike the previous two elections, he won’t face a primary opponent. McElroy filed last week to run for a sixth term.
Additionally, Democrat Rey Hernandez of Rogers filed Wednesday to run for a third time against Rep. Rebecca Burkes, R-Lowell. Hernandez said last year that he hadn’t initially planned to challenge Burkes in 2024 but changed his mind when no other Democrat had entered the race.
Four other House Republicans will face rematches with their 2024 Democratic opponents in the general election:

Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville will face Doug Corbitt of Conway
Rep. Matt Brown will face Cynthia Nations, both of Conway
Rep. Karilyn Brown of Sherwood will face Andrew Cade Eberly of Jacksonville
Rep. Cindy Crawford will face Jane-Ellen Udouj-Kutchka, both of Fort Smith

Alexander City Councilwoman Gina Thomas-Littlejohn will again face Rep. RJ Hawk, R-Bryant, in the House District 81 general election if she defeats Elijah Zane Thompson of Bryant in the Democratic primary.
 Contested primaries

Other returning candidates from both parties will not be facing their previous opponents.
Democrat Ryan Intchauspe of Rudy will run again for House District 24. He lost to Rep. Brad Hall, R-Rudy, last year in their effort to succeed Van Buren Republican Rep. Charlene Fite, who did not run for reelection.
Hall filed Nov. 4 to defend his seat but notified state officials Tuesday that he withdrew from the race, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. His decision came after the Democrat-Gazette reported that his wife accused him of abusive behavior in their ongoing divorce proceedings.
Fite filed to run for her former seat Nov. 5. She will face Melissa Koller of Alma in the Republican primary.
Democrat Cassandra Mayes (formerly Green) unsuccessfully sought Republican Rep. Brandon Achor’s seat in Maumelle’s House District 71 last year. Next year she will face Republican Stephen Bright, who represented Maumelle in the House from 2003 to 2011.
Achor is running for the Senate District 13 seat and will face former Department of Human Services administrator Mischa Martin of Sherwood in the GOP primary.
Allison Grigsby Sweatman, a North Little Rock social worker and former Young Democrats of Arkansas president, is again running for Senate District 13. She lost to incumbent Sen. Jane English, R-North Little Rock, in 2022.

English is ineligible to run again due to term limits. Sweatman will face Jason Williams of Sherwood in the Democratic primary to succeed her.
Meanwhile in the Delta, Robert Thorne Jr. of Marion is the sole Republican candidate for House District 35. He lost the 2024 election by 120 votes to Rep. Jessie McGruder, D-Marion, who is now running for an open Senate seat.
Five people filed to run in the House District 35 Democratic primary, including Sherry Holliman of Marion and Demetris Johnson of Earle. Both lost the 2024 Democratic primary to McGruder. They will face Joyce Ann Gray, Willie Williams and Audrey Willis in next year’s primary.
Another crowded primary race will be in the River Valley’s House District 46, where Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, has reached his term limit. Paris City Councilwoman Tonya Fletcher, Brian Cooper of Booneville, Curtis Varnell of Subiaco and Ronni Tate Young of Charleston are all running in the Republican primary.
Tritt and Simon, the Senate District 26 candidates, originally planned to run for House District 46 before the death of Stubblefield, who won reelection to a four-year term last year.
Two North Arkansas House districts will also see contested Republican primaries in light of their incumbent lawmakers not running for reelection.
Mike Bishop, Jon Burnside, Truman Copeland, Jeff Pratt and Boone County Justice of the Peace Kyle Evatt, all of Harrison, will seek the GOP nomination to succeed outgoing Rep. Ron McNair, R-Alpena, of House District 5.
In neighboring House District 6, Republicans Steven Baird, Cody Rogers and Carroll County Justice of the Peace Hunter Rivett are running to succeed outgoing Rep. Harlan Breaux, R-Holiday Island.
Four Republicans are vying for the House District 52 Republican nomination: Mike Jones, Dardanell City Councilwoman Crystal Malloy, Kristain Thompson and Yell County Justice of the Peace Brent Montgomery. Rep. Marcus Richmond, R-Harvey, is not running for reelection.

Former Republican Rep. Dawn Creekmore of East End, will face two primary opponents, Casey Reed and Eric Shepherd of Sheridan, in a bid to succeed outgoing Rep. Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, in House District 92.
In House District 88, Rep. Dolly Henley of Washington faces a Republican primary challenge from Lonny Mack Goodwin of Saratoga. Goodwin unsuccessfully ran as a Libertarian for a Senate seat in 2024. His wife, Tammy Goodwin, was Henley’s 2024 general election opponent, also as a Libertarian.
Coty Powers of Walnut Ridge is again running for House District 30, in which he lost the 2024 GOP primary to incumbent Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, also of Walnut Ridge. Cavenaugh is not running for another term and has endorsed Powers’ 2026 primary opponent, Josh Longmire, a Craighead County justice of the peace from Jonesboro.
No Democrats filed to run in House Districts 5, 6, 30, 46, 52, 88 or 92.
Also in Northeast Arkansas, Erika Askeland filed Wednesday to run as a Democrat for House District 32, held by Jonesboro Republican Rep. Jack Ladyman, who is running for a sixth term. Askeland unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, in 2024. She will face Josh Alfano in the 2026 Democratic primary.
 Gubernatorial and congressional contests

Sanders will not face a primary opponent on her path to a second and final term as governor. Two Democrats seek to challenge Sanders: State Sen. Fred Love of Mabelvale and Supha Xayprasith-Mays of Bentonville.

Sen. Tom Cotton is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate. He will face Micah Ashby of Bradford and Jeb Little of Harrison in the GOP primary.
Hallie Shoffner, a farmer from Newport who lives in Little Rock, and Lewisville Mayor Ethan Dunbar will compete for the Democratic nomination to run for Cotton’s seat.
All four Republicans who represent Arkansas in the U.S. House are running for reelection, and all four will face Democratic opponents:

Terri Yarbrough Green is challenging eight-term U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford in the 1st District, which covers North Arkansas, Northeast Arkansas and the Delta
Zack Huffman and former gubernatorial candidate Chris Jones will run in the Democratic primary for the 2nd District in Central Arkansas, seeking to challenge five-term U.S. Rep. French Hill
Robb Ryerse seeks to challenge eight-term U.S. Rep. Steve Womack in the 3rd District
Steven O’Donnell and James Russell III will run in the Democratic primary to challenge five-term U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman in the 4th District

Russell announced in August that he would run in the U.S. Senate primary but said in October that he would run for the 4th District instead.
Hill will be the only sitting Congressman with a primary opponent, Chase McDowell.
All Arkansas voters will see two nonpartisan state Supreme Court races on the 2026 ballot. Associate Justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni will run for each other’s positions since their appointments by Sanders make them ineligible to defend their own seats.
Bronni is running unopposed, and Hiland will face Little Rock attorney John Adams, who represented 18 plaintiffs challenging a 2023 state law that would have criminalized the availability of “obscene” library content and did not provide a clear definition of the term. A federal judge blocked the challenged sections of the law, and the state has appealed the ruling.

State probe into Black communities’ displacement surges forward with infusion of funds

Virginia’s examination of its buried history of university expansion into Black neighborhoods is entering new territory — one that may test how well research efforts translate to accountability.
A legislative commission in Richmond has spent the past year surveying nearly every public institution of higher education, finding that at least 11cited using eminent domain or other means to acquire land in majority-Black neighborhoods. At the same time, a city–university task force in Newport News is documenting the local impact of one such case involving Christopher Newport University (CNU), sharing new details about its research into the erasure of a historic Black community. 
Together, the statewide study and local inquiry illustrate how Virginia’s reckoning over displacement may unfold. At minimum, both have begun to make records and acknowledgment of these histories more public.
 Early findings

The Newport News task force — formed nearly two years ago by Mayor Phillip Jones and CNU President William Kelly — held its first public forum earlier this month. Co-chairs Vice Mayor Curtis Bethany III and CNU Provost Quentin Kidd, along with four other members, outlined progress documenting property acquisitions and interviewing impacted families.
According to their presentation, researchers have identified about 130 properties tied to the university’s expansion since the 1960s and are compiling those records into a public digital map that will be housed on the Newport News Public Library’s website.
Councilman Marcellus Harris III, who grew up in the displaced neighborhood, is helping lead interviews. Harris noted eight had been completed so far, with up to 15 more planned. Members expect to release a final report in the second half of 2026, with another public meeting planned to present recommendations.

The presentation was the task force’s most detailed update to date. Previous news releases on the university’s website offered only broad language about research and outreach to the dismay of some families, local citizens, and advocates who have been urging the group to be more open with its process.
In their first on-camera, sit-down interview with the Virginia Mercury in early November, Bethany and Kidd said the cautious pace reflects a desire to ensure accuracy before releasing information publicly.
“We needed to get to a point with the actual facts so that we could provide an update that was meaningful,” Kidd said.
Task force members said much of their work has focused on understanding the scope of displacement and how best to document it. They also described that lengthy process as key to fully understanding both the history and its impact.
“Our task force refuses to issue recommendations that are performative and carry no teeth, because we know that would deepen distrust,” said member and City Councilman Cleon Long during the presentation. “We do not want to send proposed recommendations that are dead on arrival.”
The work represents uncharted territory for the group.
“There is no blueprint,” Bethany said. “We’re learning as we go.”

 Homeowners seek clarity, concrete outcomes

Long before the public meeting, the task force  faced calls for greater transparency about the makeup of the task force and why its meetings were closed. 
Citizens raised concerns at several council meetings and community events about the lack of public access to the task force’s meetings. Letters to Mayor Phillip Jones and CNU President William Kelly urged appointing descendants or expanding citizen participation, while correspondence to the task force itself sought clearer details about its purpose.
The co-chairs said their approach — prioritizing research before engagement — was meant to build credibility, and said they remain confident in that decision despite public criticism.
“At the end of the day, you have to be confident in the work you did,” Kidd said.

Roughly 40 to 50 people attended the presentation, including current and former residents, CNU faculty and community members. Questions were collected during three separate small-group breakout discussions facilitated by the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities. Participants said conversations centered on transparency, university expansion plans and potential forms of repair.
Melvin Byrd, who grew up on Prince Drew Road, said he would like to see the website include more transparency about how the remaining property acquisitions occurred. 
“The college’s original charter was not supposed to expand beyond (that) boundary line,” he said. “They did, and the methods by which they obtained that land may or may not have been above board.”
During his session, he said two attendees suggested the university establish a fund or set-aside for descendants of displaced families. Byrd also said he hoped to see the task force make more of its property data publicly accessible.
Homeowners who still live in the neighborhood expressed desire for tangible outcomes. 
“I know the history,” said Katie Luck, one of the five remaining residents. “Now I want to know Christopher Newport’s plans for our community. I’m just not getting any answers.”
The lack of answers has kept her from improving her property, Luck said. 
“I had great plans for my home, but because of what’s been going on, we haven’t done anything to it except paint the shutters, put on a new roof, and screen the porch. That’s it.”

Gail Guynn, who lives in one of the five remaining homes in the community, expressed similar sentiments.  
“They’ve shared their research more publicly,” she said, “but what matters more to me is how honestly they’ll talk about the harmful decisions that were made, who made them, and how those decision makers will be held accountable.” Local pastors Andrew Millard and William Blackwell Jr., who have been vocal critics of the task force’s transparency over the past year, said the update was encouraging but overdue. 
“We weren’t looking for results a year ago,” Millard said. “We just wanted to know what they were doing.”
Millard said it was helpful to hear the task force is interviewing displaced families but still believes descendants should be directly represented on it. He also urged the university to be forthright about its future development.

 “One thing the university needs to do is be honest about its future expansion plans — whether that 2030 plan is still on the books or not,” he said, referring to a previously reported university site plan that called for acquiring the remaining houses in the neighborhood by that time.
Blackwell said the task force’s November update was a sign of progress but urged the group to improve its communication – suggesting the website as a tool for more consistent updates  
“Providing even brief highlights when full details aren’t available would help keep everyone informed and foster greater transparency,” Blackwell said.
He also emphasized the importance of direct engagement with affected families. “A decision has to be made one way or another,” he said. “Are we going to do reparations, a plaque, something to recognize the group? That should come from the people who were impacted — but if you don’t talk to them, then you’re doing it in a silo.”
While the task force did not outline a formal framework, its recent updates offered some indication of the guiding principles shaping its approach to recommendations. Members have expressed a desire to be intentional in their work and ensure it honors the community. At the November meeting, they also sought to distance themselves from the practical implementation of proposed recommendations – emphasizing the group “lacks the authority” to enact measures and operates separately from the city and university offices that could ultimately make those decisions.
At the same time, several members hold influential positions within those very institutions. Bethany and Long serve on the Newport News City Council, while Kidd and Vidal Dickerson, another task force member, hold executive-level roles at Christopher Newport University.
 The path forward

Looking ahead, the local task force members said insights from the November meeting will guide the next phase of the group’s work. Updates on the task force’s progress could drop soon after the state commission’s current deadline to complete its work. 
The commission’s research subcommittee is working to verify universities’ survey responses using public data and records and is seeking to hire a project coordinator to support that effort. Lawmakers approved additional funding earlier this year, bolstering the commission’s continued operation through mid-2026.
The commission’s survey responses could signal growing university collaboration in helping the legislative group document displacement histories. Of the 11 institutions that acknowledged using eminent domain or acquiring property in majority-Black neighborhoods, universities including Christopher Newport, Longwood, Old Dominion, Radford, Virginia Commonwealth, and the Virginia Military Institute confirmed such activity. Respondents also outlined the types of records available to support that history, ranging from real estate transactions and property assessments to letters and newspaper clippings related to land purchases.

In Newport News, Bethany and Kidd declined to elaborate on the outlook of the group’s final recommendations, saying they are not far enough along in their research to determine that. They did say they hope any eventual outcomes reflect the intent behind their work.
“I wouldn’t feel good if we produced a report and made recommendations that weren’t actionable,” Kidd said. “And I wouldn’t feel good if we made recommendations that were so narrowly actionable that they didn’t really seem like much.”
Bethany added that he hopes the process ultimately strengthens trust between the task force and the community and that it “feels confident in the work we’ve been able to accomplish.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)The small town of Damascus in Southwest Virginia has been eagerly rebuilding after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage in September 2024. Despite their efforts, business was still significantly down for the town on the one-year anniversary of the storm, largely because the most popular part of the Virginia Creeper Trail — the town’s chief recreational attraction — was washed away. Now, the community is taking the first steps to bringing it back.
In Damascus, business is down but hopes are high one year after Hurricane Helene

The contract to rebuild the biking trail from Whitetop to Damascus has been awarded to Omaha-based Kiewit Corporation and is worth over $240 million. The company will use crews out of Peachtree, Georgia that are expected to arrive in town in the next week to start work.
“The Virginia Creeper Trail is the lifeline of our precious little Town,” said Mayor Katie Lamb. “Damascus, the heart of the Creeper Trail, is thrilled to welcome the Kiewit team. We are beyond excited for the rebuilding of the trail and the economic impact this will bring back to Southwest Virginia.”
The small town of Damascus, which boasts a population of 747 people, is a destination for outdoor enthusiasts who meet on the Appalachian trail and bike or hike the Creeper Trail, among dozens of other attractions.
The lion’s share of the economy for Damascus, dubbed “Trail Town USA,” is supported by the cyclists who take the Creeper Trail’s scenic route down from Whitetop and cruise into Damascus. It being mostly downhill makes it more accessible for all ages to ride and the mostly forested area provides shade and spectacular mountain views.
With that portion of the trail totally washed out for over a year, businesses said they were down as much as 75% during what was supposed to be their peak season in September. The U.S. Forest Service has removed 30,000 cubic yards of debris in order for the construction company to get in to replace miles of trail and 30 trestle bridges.
Local businesses have urged the public to come ride the less popular portion of the trail that stretches from Damascus to Abingdon. It is not fully downhill like the Whitetop portion, which can make it more difficult for some ability levels.
The town is hopeful that with the influx of contractors coming to town to work on the trail, the town will see some economic benefits. During the Hurricane Helene anniversary commemoration event, Town Manager Chris Bell said they hope to work out ways for the contractor to utilize local shuttles and other businesses.
“We have been proactively working with local businesses and property owners to prepare for this influx of contractors and temporary economic boost over the next year,” Bell said.
The construction is anticipated to be completed in the fall of 2026.

Ohio law currently allows 14 and 15 year olds to work till 9 p.m. during the summer or during a school holiday, meaning they are not able to work past 7 p.m. during the school year on school nights.
However, Ohio is unable to change the law without the federal government making changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 
Ohio lawmakers also recently passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 which urges Congress to alter the Fair Labor Standards Act to let a teenager younger than 16 work between 7-9 p.m. during the school year if the teen has their parent or guardian’s permission. 
Ohio Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, introduced both Senate Bill 50 and the Senate Resolution earlier this year, which says 14 and 15 year olds would need approval from a parent or guardian to work till 9 p.m.
“Give 14 and 15 year olds another opportunity to stay an extra hour to work at a grocery store bagging groceries or even to make an extra buck,” Ohio state Rep. Mark Johnson, R-Chillicothe, said during a recent Ohio House session. “I find that there’s not a thing wrong with learning how to work at a young age.” 
Johnson shared how he delivered newspapers and worked on a vegetable farm when he was growing up. He said he got a job working at Waffle House his senior year of high school and became the assistant manager before he was 19. 
“I learned how to work and be productive at a young age,” he said. “None of that hurt me one bit.”
State Rep. Lauren McNally, D-Youngstown, was shocked her fellow lawmakers were in favor of passing the bill. 
“How dare we pretend that putting 14 year olds on late-night shifts, in dangerous workplaces, is somehow helping families.” she said. “It’s not helping anyone. It’s exploitation, plain and simple.”
She argued teenagers can not fill Ohio’s most in-demand jobs, which include nurses, home health aides, and truck drivers. 
“It’s not about filling workforce gaps,” McNally said. “It’s about filling corporate pockets. … The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was our promise to America’s children: You deserve a childhood. You deserve an education. You deserve safety. Now you want to tear that promise apart for profit.”
Ohio businesses can pay 14 and 15 year olds the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is less than the state’s minimum wage of $10.70 per hour, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce.  
“We’ve created a system where families are forced to rely on their kid’s wages just to survive, and instead of fixing that by paying adults a living wage by supporting affordable child care, we’re about to hand corporations a new generation of underpaid, overworked, under-protected employees, and shame on us if we let that happen,” McNally said. 
Ohio House Democrats Chris Glassburn and Daniel Troy voted for the bill and the Senate Resolution, while Ohio House Republicans Jason Stephens and Scott Oelslager voted against them both. 
The Ohio Restaurant and Hospitality Alliance spoke in favor of the bill earlier this year during committee while the Children’s Defense Fund of Ohio opposes the bill.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)When six Southern public university systems this summer formed a new accreditation agency, the move shook the national evaluation model that higher education has relied on for decades.
The news wasn’t unexpected: It arrived a few months after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in April overhauling the nation’s accreditation system by, among other things, barring accreditors from using college diversity mandates. It also came after U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon in May made it easier for universities to switch accreditors.
The accreditation process, often bureaucratic, cumbersome and time consuming, is critical to the survival of institutions of higher education. Colleges and their individual departments must undergo outside reviews — usually every few years — to prove that they meet certain educational and financial standards. If a school is not accredited, its students cannot receive federal aid such as Pell grants and student loans.
Some accreditation agencies acknowledge the process needs to evolve. But critics say the Trump administration is reshaping accreditation for political reasons, and risks undermining the legitimacy of the degrees colleges and universities award to students.
Trump said during his campaign that he would wield college accreditation as a “secret weapon” to root out DEI and other “woke” ideas from higher education. He has made good on that pledge.
Over the summer, for example, the administration sent letters to the accreditors of both Columbia and Harvard universities, alleging that the schools had violated federal civil rights law, and thus their accreditation rules, by failing to prevent the harassment of Jewish students after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel.
The administration’s antipathy toward DEI has prompted some accreditors to remove diversity requirements. The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, for instance, removed diversity and inclusion language from its guiding principles earlier this year. Under White House pressure, the American Bar Association this year suspended enforcement of its DEI standards for its accreditation of law schools and has extended that suspension into next year.
But state legislatures laid the groundwork for public university accreditation changes even before Trump returned to the White House.
Some public universities report fewer international students amid Trump restrictions

In 2022, Florida enacted a law requiring the state’s public institutions to switch accreditors every cycle — usually every few years — forcing them to move away from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, known as SACSCOC.
North Carolina followed suit in 2023, with a law prohibiting the 16 universities within the University of North Carolina system and the state’s community colleges from receiving accreditation from the same agency for consecutive cycles.
Then, the consortium of six Southern university systems this summer launched its new accreditation agency, called the Commission for Public Higher Education. The participating states include Florida and North Carolina, along with Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news release that the commission will “break the ideological stronghold” that other accreditation agencies have on higher education. Speaking at Florida Atlantic University, he said the new organization will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
“We care about student achievement; we care about measurable outcomes; we care about efficiency; we care about pursuing truth; we care about preparing our students to be citizens of our republic,” DeSantis said.
Jan Friis, senior vice president for government affairs at the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, which represents accrediting agencies, said the century-old system is in the midst of its most significant changes since the federal government tied accreditation to student aid after World War II.
“If the student picks a school that’s not accredited by a recognized accreditor, they can’t spend any federal aid there,” Friis said. “Accreditation has become the ‘good housekeeping seal of approval.’”
What’s next for the new accreditor
Dan Harrison, who is leading the startup phase of the Commission for Public Higher Education, described accreditation as “the plumbing of the whole higher ed infrastructure.”
“It’s not dramatic. It’s not meant to be partisan. But it’s critical to how schools function,” said Harrison, who is the University of North Carolina System’s vice president for academic affairs.
Though the founding schools of the new commission are all in the South, Harrison said, he expects accreditation to shift away from the long-standing geography-based model. In the past, universities in the South were accredited by SACSCOC simply because of location. In the future, he said, public universities across the country might instead be grouped together because they share similar governance structures, funding constraints and oversight.
Trump’s DEI ban in K-12 schools, higher ed ruled ‘unlawful’ by federal judge

“In 2025, if you were designing accreditation from scratch, you wouldn’t build it around geography,” Harrison said. “Public universities have more in common with each other across states than they do with private or for-profit institutions in their own backyard.”
The Commission for Public Higher Education opened with an initial cohort capped at 10 institutions within the first six states. Harrison said that based on the interest, the group could have accepted 15 to 20.
“I thought we’d be at six or seven. We reached 10 quickly and across a wider range of institutions than expected,” he said. “We already have an applicant outside the founding states. That’s well ahead of where I thought we would be.”
That early interest, he said, reflects frustration among public institutions around finances. In particular, public universities are mandated to undergo audits from the state, but also feel burdened by audits required by accreditors.
“Public universities already undergo multiple audits and state budget oversight,” he said. “Then accreditation requires them to do the same work again. It feels like reinventing the wheel and it pulls faculty and staff away from teaching and research.”
Harrison estimates it will take five to seven years for the new accreditor to be fully up and running, and that institutions will need to maintain dual accreditation to avoid risking Pell Grants and federal loans.
The commission is busy assembling peer review teams made up primarily of current and former public university leaders such as governing board members, system chancellors, provosts, chief financial officers, deans and faculty. In contrast to regional accreditors, which typically draw reviewers from both public and private institutions, the new commission is prioritizing reviewers from public universities.
“Ultimately, we want to be a true nationwide accreditor,” Harrison said. “Not a regional one. Not a partisan one. Just one that is organized around sector and peer expertise.”
While the creation of a public university accreditor is new, the concept of sector-specific accreditation exists in other parts of higher education, including for two-year colleges.
Mac Powell, president of the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, said that tailoring accreditation to a sector can make the peer-review model more meaningful, because reviewers can identify with similar challenges. He said reviewers have been moving away from measuring resources and bureaucratic compliance toward assessing what students actually get out of their education.
“The big shift was moving from counting inputs to asking, ‘Did students actually learn what we said they would learn?’” said Powell, whose organization accredits 138 colleges across Arizona, California, New York and the Pacific.
The most important metric all accreditation models should value is how they transition their students into the workforce, he said.
“Every accreditor today is paying much more attention to retention, persistence, transfer, career outcomes and return on investment,” Powell said. “It’s becoming less about how many books are in the library and more about whether students can find a pathway to the middle class.”
The institution evolves
Stephen Pruitt is in his first year as the president of SACSCOC, the accreditation organization that the half-dozen Southern state university systems just left. Pruitt, a Georgia native, jokes that his “Southern accent and front-porch style” has helped him break down the importance of accreditation to just about anyone.










There’s this myth that I’m sitting in Atlanta deciding if institutions are good or not. That’s not how American accreditation works.


– Stephen Pruitt, president of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges


In simple terms, he said, accreditation is the system that makes college degrees real. But he feels he has to clarify a misconception about the role of accreditation agencies like SACSCOC.
“There’s this myth that I’m sitting in Atlanta deciding if institutions are good or not,” he said. “That’s not how American accreditation works. Your peers evaluate you. People who do the same work you do.”
At the same time, Pruitt isn’t dismissing the concerns that prompted states such as Florida and North Carolina to explore alternatives to SACSCOC. According to Pruitt, institutions have long raised concerns about slow turnaround times, redundant paperwork and standards that have not always adapted quickly to the evolving landscape in higher education.
“Some of the frustration is real. Institutions want less redundancy and more responsiveness. Competition isn’t something we’re afraid of,” he said. “We’re doing a full audit of our processes. We have to be more contemporary. Faster approvals, more flexibility, more transparency. Accreditation shouldn’t just be the stick. It should be the carrot too.”

(Getty Images.)The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association wants the state supreme court to reverse a decision allowing American Electric Power to charge data centers differently than it does other power customers.
In their appeal, association attorneys called the effort a “flagrant and unlawful effort to discriminate against certain customers.”
When it approved the plan, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio characterized it as a compromise meant to ensure ordinary customers aren’t forced to pay for the costs of connecting dozens of new, power intensive facilities.
Background
The case centers on a new data center tariff that Ohio utility regulators recently approved.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A tariff sets the terms on which a power company delivers electricity. You likely get power under a residential service tariff, for instance.
Ohio’s utilities are commonly known as ‘pole and wire’ companies — regulated monopolies in charge of maintaining the state’s energy delivery system.
The PUCO sets rates and allows utilities to bill customers for building out the transmission system.
According to a data center tracker, Ohio has the fifth most data centers in the country.
In 2024, AEP told the PUCO that surge in demand from data centers presents a unique challenge for its long-term planning.
The company paused new data center service requests in March of 2023.
In its filings with the PUCO, AEP claimed it had more than 50 data centers in the queue, representing more than 30,000 megawatts of additional power demand.
To cover the cost of buildout, AEP proposed a new tariff with minimum purchase requirements and long-term contracts, with a ramp-up period and an exit fee if a data center decides to exit the market early.
The company stressed that those requirements were meant to insulate other customers from associated infrastructure costs.
In July of this year, the PUCO signed off on a negotiated version of the plan.
Data center customers must pay for at least 85% of the power they say they need — even if their actual usage is less.
Contracts would last at least 12 years, with an exit fee of three years’ worth of minimum charges.
Ohio regulators turn down appeal, OK utility’s data center billing plan

In a press release, AEP Ohio President and CEO Marc Reitter said the tariff “brings clarity and certainty for infrastructure planning.”
“We are looking forward to ending the moratorium and continuing to support development of more data centers in our service territory,” he said.
The appeal
The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association criticizes not just the new tariff in its appeal, but also AEP’s moratorium on new data center customers.
“AEP unilaterally imposed this discriminatory, unnecessary, unjustified, and unlawful moratorium on connecting these new customers based solely on their business function and use of electricity,” the court filing states.
Association attorneys note state regulators never signed off on the moratorium and that it “flies in the face” of state law which requires a utility serve all customers within its territory.
Choking off the industry amounted to “improper gamesmanship,” the filing continues, which gave AEP “undue bargaining power” as the tariff case worked its way through the PUCO.
What’s more, the manufacturers association thinks AEP’s claims about future demand might be bogus.
Throughout the PUCO process, the organization insisted AEP hadn’t hadn’t shared sufficient evidence to back up its dire warnings.
The association’s appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court focuses on “unreasonable assumptions” driving the tariff approval.
The PUCO tacitly agreed AEP could refuse service through its moratorium, the association argued, and tacitly agreed that future demand presents an actual problem.
Regulators also treated a tariff singling out a specific class of user as “not unduly discriminatory” and didn’t consider the tariff a rate increase.
In a press release announcing its appeal, the organization maintained that the PUCO decision was based on “overstated and speculative transmission concerns.”
“The PUCO has rigged the scales, greenlighting utility discrimination and setting a precedent that could be used to hammer manufacturers and weaken Ohio’s economic edge,” Ohio Manufacturers’ Association President Ryan Augsburger said.
“This fight isn’t about one tariff. It’s about fairness, justice and restoring balance for the future of Ohio manufacturing.”
But AEP pushed back.
In a statement after the association filed its Ohio Supreme Court appeal, the company insisted the tariff “ensures that large data center customers will pay their fair share of the costs of the upgrades needed to serve their demand for electricity.”
The “firm contractual commitments” it requires will avoid “stranded investment costs” and protect other ratepayers, the statement said.
“Frankly,” it continued, “we are confused as to why OMA would appeal a ruling that protects their members from absorbing the costs associated with building out electric infrastructure to meet data centers’ needs.”

Now, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether or not states like Ohio can count absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day after election night.
S.B. 293
When it comes to elections, every vote counts — especially in local races.
The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections data shows 10 races were within about 20 votes, with six being within 10, and there were even several ties.
In Cincinnati, the Hamilton County elections board results show that at least 12 races were within 20 votes, with eight being within 10.
This is why voting rights advocate Jen Miller with the League of Women Voters of Ohio says the state’s four-day grace period is essential.
Ballots will still be counted as long as they are returned within four days of the election if they are postmarked before Election Day.
In Cuyahoga County, 2,996 valid ballots came in during that period, more than some races even had votes.
So far, 3,373 ballots have come in since Tuesday; however, hundreds are invalid. Of the total amount, 1,461 were from registered Democrats, 611 from Republicans and 1,301 from voters without a party affiliation.
More than 360 couldn’t be counted because they came in after the grace period, the elections board said.
“It’s incredibly important that every eligible voter can cast their ballot,” Miller said.
“Our concern with Senate Bill 293 would be that many votes would not count for something that’s outside of the voter’s control, which is the speed of the mail.”
Concerns for military
The majority of Ohio Senate Republicans voted to pass S.B. 293, requiring the vast majority of ballots to be returned by the close of polls on election night.
When we first reported on the introduction of this legislation in October, veterans shared concerns about active-duty military members being disenfranchised.
Following our coverage, the lawmakers made an exemption for uniformed and overseas absentee voters.
The case for S.B. 293
Each of Ohio Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s election audits has shown no proof of widespread voter fraud, but Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said that this bill could help reassure skeptics.
“You still see people losing confidence in their election officials and the election systems in those states when there’s uncertainty that extends beyond election night,” McColley said.
For years, President Donald Trump and some GOP leaders have insisted, without evidence, that mail-in ballots are fraudulent.
Following his lead, red states have started restricting access.
Supreme Court will weigh in
Now, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it will decide whether or not ballots can be counted after Election Day, as the Republican National Committee is suing Mississippi, which has a similar law to Ohio.
“We might wind up being mandated by the Supreme Court at some point in the future,” McColley said. “We also, I do think, need to look at the 50 laboratories of democracy.”
Ohio wouldn’t be an outlier in the states that make the absentee deadline Election Day.
Dozens of states, like Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, all require ballots to be in on or before Election Day.
Miller says S.B. 293 will hurt voters.
According to state data, nearly 10,000 ballots came in during the four days after the 2024 presidential election.
“Senior citizens, people with disabilities, rural Ohioans, students — these are all populations that are more likely to need to vote absentee, but may also be affected by a slower mail service,” she said.
The Ohio House will hear the bill in the coming months.

(Photo by Getty Images)As a mom with kids in Kansas schools, I see the future of our state every day. I see it every time we talk about college applications, first jobs, and what kind of future my kids want to build here in Kansas.
But as the president and CEO of an organization that works with educators, employers and policymakers across Kansas and Missouri, I also see the widening gap between the skills our students are learning and the demands of today’s workforce. The gap threatens the strength of our communities, the future of our economy, and most importantly, our kids.
Across the state of Kansas, I continue to hear the same message. In Hutchinson, business owners say they can’t fill positions. In Wichita, hospitals are short on nurses and technicians. In Salina, manufacturers can’t find enough trained workers to keep up with demand. These are not isolated challenges. They are symptoms of a talent pipeline that isn’t keeping pace with the needs of Kansas employers.
My organization has spent the past year traveling across the state on a Cradle to Career Listening Tour. We met with parents, teachers, students, and business leaders in every corner of Kansas to ask what’s working and what isn’t. Their message was clear: We have to do more to educate the future workforce that our state will need.
The path from classroom to career begins long before graduation. Early childhood education gives our kids the foundation to learn.
It continues with strong K–12 schools that retain great teachers in the classroom.
It extends through technical training and higher education that prepares students for real, high-skilled jobs.
When any part of that system falters, families and communities experience the impact. Parents who can’t find affordable child care are forced to step out of the workforce. Schools that lose experienced teachers struggle to maintain stability and quality. And when students can’t see how their education connects to real careers, too many leave Kansas to find opportunity somewhere else.
However, Kansans also know what works. Parents and educators told us about career and technical education programs that connect students directly to employers. Businesses shared how apprenticeships help students earn while they learn. Communities talked about partnerships that make college more affordable and accessible. These are Kansas solutions, grounded in practicality and collaboration.
If we want to stay competitive as a state, we must treat education as the backbone of our economy. Just as we invest in roads and broadband, we must invest in the systems that build human potential. Our teachers, our schools, and our training programs are not expenses, they are economic infrastructure.
As a mom and business leader who is passionate about helping Kansas kids succeed, I feel the urgency of this moment. The future workforce is sitting in our classrooms today. Whether those students stay in Kansas, build their careers here, and raise their families here depends on the choices we make now.
What gives me hope is the Kansas spirit I’ve seen in every community visited on the listening tour. People are willing to come together, to listen, and to find common ground. Parents, educators, and employers all want the same thing: a future where every child has the chance to succeed and every business has the talent it needs to grow.
As we look ahead to the 2026 legislative session, we have an opportunity to turn those conversations into action. Investing in education is not a partisan issue, it is a Kansas priority.
If we want a strong workforce tomorrow, we have to educate students today. Our future depends on it.

The approval of the three bills after nightfall was preceded by an all-day debate and party-line vote on a fourth bill adopting a revised version of an omnibus housing bill vetoed by Gov. Ned Lamont in June. Senate votes are planned on all four bills Thursday, and Lamont pledges to sign them.
[Related: CT House adopts relief fund to bolster federal programs]
House Bill 8001, legislation enabling UConn Health to purchase Waterbury Hospital from an out-of-state owner in bankruptcy, passed on a 133-11 vote that reflected the bipartisan negotiations preceding the vote, as well as the hospital’s economic and medical importance to the state’s fifth-largest city and its suburbs.
In an era when hospital chains are dominating health care, the measure also allows the university’s teaching hospital to purchase two independent nonprofit hospitals, Bristol and Day Kimball. UConn has an agreement to buy Waterbury Hospital for $13 million. 
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, introduced the bill as “a forward-thinking proposal that will protect access to health care for thousands of Connecticut residents while strengthening the state’s public health system for generations to come across Connecticut.”
The bill allows UConn Health to create subsidiaries or joint ventures in order to purchase the hospitals while authorizing $390 million in bonding to support capital improvements at the facilities the health network acquires. The debt will be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package, the state’s financing program for capital projects at the University of Connecticut.
Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, who was born in Waterbury Hospital, celebrated the bill as bringing a valued community resource back from near death.
“It’s comforting to know that we have a solution to a problem that has persisted and plagued the greater Waterbury area,” he said.
Horn said the bill is critical to securing the future of all three hospitals. 
“Without intervention, we risk losing these facilities and the service that they provide to their communities. The bill we have in front of us offers a responsible, sustainable solution to that,” Horn said.
Curbing ICE activities
The final measure passed Wednesday night, House Bill 8004, was a compilation of unrelated provisions, including a child behavioral health measure incorporating the recommendations of a study group.
“We are happy to see that the legislature is taking up recommendations from the Transforming Children’s Behavioral Health Policy and Planning Committee,” said Christina Gio, the state’s child advocate. “The study of existing behavioral health services and future demand for services is critically important to ensuring that children have access to appropriate mental health services when they need them.”
Among other things, it would increase the age at which people are eligible for autism therapies and services from 21 to 26. It would also require a committee on children’s behavioral health to study existing services for that population and develop a survey for school-based health centers, add three new members to that committee, and require the committee to convene a working group
“Currently, children may need crisis intervention, such as intensive in-home child and adolescent psychiatric services, and be put on a months-long wait list,” Ghio said in a statement. “The study will help the state identify what services children need and plan for the development of a continuum of mental health services for children so that children in crisis are not waiting for treatment.”
It was the least controversial element of the final bill. The measure also would impose a 5-cent charge on mobile phone bills to raise money for a firefighters’ cancer relief fund. Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, said the state should appropriate money directly for the fund, instead of taxing phone bills.
But the provisions drawing the most attention were those intended to curb the activities of Immigrations and Custom Enforcement agents in and around state courthouses.
One provision codified in state law the judicial system’s policy barring ICE arrests in courthouses without a judicial warrant. It also expands the ban to courthouse grounds and bans law enforcement from wearing masks in and around courts.
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said the measure creates the sense of doing more  than it actually accomplishes.
“Advocates outside of these walls think that they are getting protection through this legislation. They aren’t. They’ve been sold a bill of goods,” said Fishbein, a lawyer and the ranking House Republican on the Judiciary Committee.
The bill states that federal and state law enforcement agents cannot arrest or detain someone at a courthouse based on a civil offense, which includes staying in the country on an expired visa. But entering the country illegally is a federal crime, Fishbein said.
“An individual who has entered this country illegally has no protection under this language, even though advocates have been told, ‘You’re protected,'” he said.
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, replied that the bill was valuable even if it only protected a small number of people.
“I personally think this bill goes further than that. I think that this bill also protects many folks who are undocumented,” he said. “All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses.”

Farmer lives in Crystal River, and she’s worried that the Florida Department of Transportation and one of its contractors are attacking the source of her drinking water.
You might be inclined to scoff, but something remarkable happened last week to suggest she’s right to be concerned.
Here’s how the Citrus County Chronicle reported it: “A Florida Turnpike contractor operating an excavator at a proposed sand mine site in north Citrus County was suddenly inundated with water last week, forcing the operator to swim to safety, according to witnesses and local residents.”
Holy cow! The excavator sank like the Titanic! Excavator operators don’t normally wear personal flotation devices, but maybe it’s time they started.
The Chronicle, in a follow-up note on Facebook, reported that a DOT division known as the Florida Turnpike Authority “said it confirmed that the construction activity did not affect the underlying aquifer system.”
Yet even after the excavator was pulled loose, “the water in the ‘pond’ is not receding,” Farmer told me. “We know that it is not likely that there was any standing water on that property before they started digging. The water could have only come from one place, the spring below.”
Farmer co-chairs an organization called Stop the Sand Mine in Citrus County. It has now filed a formal complaint with both the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Southwest Florida Water Management District, seeking “enforcement action concerning unpermitted excavation and groundwater exposure.”
How the Crystal River folks got to this point with the 320-acre mine site, she said, is “a long story with lots of twists and turns.” The one constant, she told me, is this: Nobody in local or state government wants to tell the citizens what’s happening.

Manatee madness
Crystal River holds some of Florida’s most fascinating history.
The highest point for miles around, for instance, is a 28-foot-tall temple mound of shells in Crystal River Archaeological State Park. It marks the site of one of the longest continuously occupied pre-Columbian locations in Florida. People who lived there would trade with villages thousands of miles away. 
These days, shells are less important. Instead, Crystal River has a manatee-based economy. Manatee signs and figures here are as ubiquitous as Mickey Mouse ears at Disney World. Most are advertising tours to experience manatees first-hand, but that’s not all.
The first time I visited Citrus County, I was astonished at how many businesses had “manatee” in their names, even though they had nothing to do with sea cows. Auto repair, appliance sales, you name it and people were trying to be associated with manatees.
And to top it all off, every January, there’s a two-day Florida Manatee Festival.
Crystal River’s manatee madness started with a scientist named Daniel “Woodie” Hartman, who in the late 1960s and early ’70s repeatedly dove into Kings Bay to conduct the first in-depth studies of the manatees that routinely gathered there.
Hartman became so close with some of his study subjects that from time to time they would grasp his face mask in their flippers and bestow on him something like a kiss.
Jacques Yves-Cousteau via IMDB
In 1969, Hartman wrote about his research for National Geographic, which led to a 1972 Jacques Yves-Cousteau TV special on manatees, titled “Forgotten Mermaids.” Cousteau’s special tantalized viewers worldwide and they began flocking to Crystal River to see — and to swim with — the manatees.
The manatees are attracted to Crystal River by the springs that feed Kings Bay. Those springs flow from the aquifer that provides humans with their drinking water. The underground cave system that the aquifer flows through has been known, from time to time, to open up a sinkhole to the surface.
The site where the proposed sand mine is located lies within an area that’s supposed to receive enhanced protection. It’s in the Kings Bay Outstanding Florida Spring Priority Focus Area, as well as an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a Special Flood Hazard Area.
A DOT engineer’s report on the sand mine site pointed out that it is “underlain by limestone bedrock that is susceptible to dissolution and the subsequent development of … sinkholes.”
While Farmer and other members of her group are concerned about that, no one in local or state government appears to be.
Just guessing
A crucial part of this sand mine story is the toll road known as the Suncoast Parkway. I’ve been writing about the Suncoast for 25 years — usually about how it’s based on bogus figures.
The first story, published in 2000, reported on how a DOT consultant known as URS Greiner Woodward Clyde, had repeatedly produced inflated traffic projections. Those numbers were used to justify launching the construction of unneeded toll roads around the state.
“In 1992 URS predicted the Suncoast Parkway would be so popular it would make $70 million in 2002 and $119 million in 2010,” the story reported. “That persuaded the state to proceed with planning the highway.”
But then URS repeatedly scaled back its projections until it said the Suncoast would bring in only $14 million in 2002 and $31 million by 2010. If it had given those figures first, the road would never have been built.
“Ten years ago, we were basically guessing,” a URS official told me then, not sounding the least bit embarrassed. “Even two years ago.”
Even those updated projections turned out to be wrong. In 2014, the Suncoast drew so little traffic that it collected only $22 million.
But by then, the DOT was already pushing to build an extension called “Suncoast 2” another 13 miles north through Citrus County. Providing the traffic projections: The same consultant that had been so wrong before.
“There’s very little population in that area so there’s no good reason to build this road,” a member of the Suncoast Sierra Club said then. “It seems like a costly gift to road builders and developers at the expense of the environment — the very opposite of smart growth.”
Now the DOT’s Turnpike Enterprise division is working on extending the unsuccessful Suncoast even further north. To do that, they need a lot of sand, and for their convenience they’d prefer to acquire it from a new sand mine right next door to their right of way.
And that’s where George Southworth comes in.
Enter sandman
Southworth isn’t just the owner of the sand mine property. He’s also one of the DOT’s longtime contractors. He runs a Tampa company called Concrete Impressions of Florida that manufactures sound barriers.
George Southworth via Pilot Bancshares
“What I do for a living is build walls,” he told WFTS-TV in 2017, when he was offering his company’s help in building Donald Trump’s border wall. (Yes, really.) “For the last 20 years we’ve built millions upon millions of sound barriers along the side of the interstate.”
As Mark Twain might have put it, there’s gold in them thar walls. Southworth has made so much money off that and his other real estate interests that by 2014 he’d become the largest single shareholder in Pilot Bancshares, the parent company of Pilot Bank.
I talked on the phone with Southworth, who told me the people opposed to his sand mine are just a bunch of bored retirees who don’t know what they’re talking about.
“I really do like the environment,” he told me.
That prompted me to ask about his citation for harming a gopher tortoise.
In 2022, Southworth was cited by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for illegally harming or killing a gopher tortoise, classified as a threatened species. Pasco County court records show he pleaded no contest.
He told me this case resulted from a complaint from a vindictive neighbor. He said he pleaded no contest and paid $241 in court costs just to make the case go away. When I asked what he’d done to the gopher tortoise, he blamed one of his employees for damaging a tortoise burrow.
That wasn’t the only accusation he faced from Pasco neighbors. One accused him of illegally cutting down trees, prompting the water district to warn him to stop. The neighbor said he boasted on a conference call that he could “nuke” any wetland on his property and get away with it.
That’s important because on his Crystal River property, where he wants to begin mining sand to sell to the DOT, the Adventure Coast Sierra Club says, “The land has scattered wetlands onsite, and a biological survey found gopher tortoises and Sherman’s fox squirrels.”
Southworth told me repeatedly how his sand mine would be so much better for the aquifer than building another pollution-spewing subdivision or big shopping mall.
When I asked him how the excavator turned into  “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,” he started laughing.
“I don’t know what happened,” he said. “That has nothing to do with the sand mine.”
He told me the luckless excavator was working for the DOT, digging a retention pond for the toll road.
“For the life of me,” he said, “I can’t understand why he was digging a hole that deep.”
‘The people that care’
Before I talked to Southworth, I watched a public hearing about the mine site at which he spoke briefly. There were 60 or so people there opposed to the mine. Southworth contended that his apparent unpopularity was misleading.
“The people that are in favor of this don’t come to meetings,” he said. “The only people that come to meetings are the people that care.”
Darryl Johnston via screen grab
Christian Waugh via Waugh website
The meeting at which Southworth spoke was held because he was seeking a change in the zoning from “agriculture” to “extractive.” Presiding over this quasi-judicial proceeding was a special master named Christian Waugh.
During the hearing, Southworth’s attorney, Darryl Johnston, repeatedly told Waugh that the mining wouldn’t affect the aquifer or the drinking water of neighbors such as Farmer.
After listening to testimony for three hours, Waugh asked several questions. One was whether, after all the sand is removed, the mining site could be restored to its pristine state, as required by the county’s comprehensive growth plan.
George Foster via screen grab
“It obviously cannot be,” Southworth’s engineer, George Foster, replied. “It’s gonna be a lake.”
To restore the mine to its original condition, Foster said, would require digging up tons of sand from somewhere else and dumping it back on Southworth’s property.
“I was very shocked to hear that,” Waugh said. “Until that point, I was prepared to recommend approval, but I can’t go against the comp plan.”
Waugh’s recommendation that the county deny Southworth’s zoning change was a wrinkle that neither Southworth nor the DOT expected.
When I asked Southworth about it, he insisted that Waugh interpreted the comp plan language incorrectly and added, “Whether he was politically influenced or just wrong, I don’t know.”
He said everyone better just get used to the DOT doing whatever it wants.
“Florida is growing, and they’re building this turnpike to promote and accommodate the growth,” he said.
The DOT is now acquiring about 50 acres of Southworth’s parcel. The agency seems prepared to push ahead with the mine. As DOT district secretary Justin Hall told Citrus County commissioners, the DOT is not bound by local land-use regulations.
But the state agency that spreads pavement wherever it goes is supposed to be bound by the state and federal regulations that protect both the aquifer and Kings Bay.
Safe for the springs
A couple of weeks ago, before that excavator turned into “The Poseidon Adventure,” the DOT held a public hearing in Crystal River. The hearing was about its next Suncoast Parkway extension.
Two Sierra Club volunteers, Robin Orlandi and P.J. Aufhammer, showed up and asked lots of questions. I talked to both of them.
Robin Orlandi via Sierra Club
Orlandi told me one of the DOT experts at the hearing suggested that the agency might use Southworth’s site for a retention pond for the new toll road.
“It sounded like they were going to create a sand mine without calling it a sand mine,” she told me.
The DOT folks made it clear to the pair that this latest iteration of the Suncoast would be built despite any public opposition. It is as inevitable as the villainous Thanos in “Avengers: Endgame.” That’s because if it’s not connected to U.S. 19, the truncated Suncoast will continue to fail to attract traffic.
But that doesn’t mean Southworth’s sand mine is inevitable.
Orlandi said she’d like to see that property wind up as part of the Florida Wildlife Corridor, which has run into a roadblock (pun intended) in that part of Citrus County.
Farmer told me something similar, but less specific.
“This land sits over the water that gives life to Kings Bay and our community,” she told me. “We want it protected — not mined, not paved, not filled with septic tanks. It should stay … safe for our springs.”
All I know is, the DOT better fix this situation before everyone’s faucets start producing something that no one will want to swallow.

Connecticut faces some serious challenges these days. Home prices are endlessly climbing upwards, pushing working folks into poverty, out on the streets, or out of the state. Our car traffic is some of the worst in the country. Carbon emissions are on the rise, accelerating the pace of climate change. What can we do to deal with these multifaceted, yet interconnected issues? 
Let’s address these problems one at a time. The simplest way to lower the cost of a home is to build more of them, but through zoning regulations, many Connecticut towns only allow for the construction of single-family homes on large plots of land. If we rely solely on this model, we would have to devastate countless acres of our state’s natural areas in order to build the quantity of housing we need to lower aggregate costs. 
Additionally, the physical distance between residential and commercial areas that single-family zoning creates makes car ownership a necessity. This has two major drawbacks. Firstly, cars are a huge contributor to carbon emissions and thus, climate change. Secondly, more cars means more traffic for everybody. One of the biggest reasons cited for opposition to new housing is the impact of new developments on local car traffic. 
The state has created quite a conundrum for itself. If we want home prices to go down, we need to build more housing, but if we only build single-family homes, we’re stuck with more traffic, more pollution, and less wildlife. What is the answer to this perplexing problem? 
Trains are the answer. Trains offer commuters a climate-friendly alternative to gridlock traffic and its poisonous exhaust. Trains enable the development of walkable communities, creating arteries of transportation that allow us to build housing up instead of out, preserving our precious greenspace. 
The Nutmeg State is crisscrossed with train tracks, many of which now lie abandoned or disused, relegated to the infrequent shuttling of freight. These forgotten tracks offer us an exciting opportunity; if we upgrade these tracks to support passenger service and build walkable housing adjacent to revitalized stations, we can cut through Connecticut’s Gordian Knot of transportation, housing, and environmental issues.
This proposal isn’t mere daydreaming; states like Maryland, New York, and Montana  have already embarked on this journey, recognizing the huge potential offered by rail reactivation. The Train Campaign now calls upon the Connecticut Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study to explore the reactivation of passenger rail service on two underutilized tracks: the Maybrook and Housatonic (aka Berkshire) lines. This study should aim to determine the most economically beneficial and least costly options for reactivating these lines, with findings made available to Connecticut policymakers by January 2027.
The Maybrook Line connects the Waterbury, Danbury, and Harlem Metro-North lines, offering a potential new east–west transportation corridor for Connecticut and New York. The Housatonic Line could reconnect communities along the Massachusetts border, reopening a historic route between Pittsfield and Danbury.
We wouldn’t be building from scratch. The tracks already exist, and several former stations remain. The potential to boost accessibility, stimulate local economies, and reduce traffic and emissions is enormous.
We urge the Connecticut Department of Transportation to undertake this feasibility study with an eye towards determining which project would yield the greatest benefits while being the most feasible to implement. If you support such a study being conducted, please click here to sign our petition. In doing so, you are helping us push forward a greener and more connected Connecticut.

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The General Assembly’s top budget analyst cautioned lawmakers against draining the state’s cash reserves to offset a nearly $1.5 billion  deficit that has emerged in the coming fiscal year.
With lawmakers unlikely to raise taxes in an election year, one potential option for covering more than half the shortfall would be to pull $815 million from the state’s $2.3 billion rainy day account. But Department of Legislative Services budget analyst David Romans warned that could hurt the state’s bond-rating now and leave it unprepared for greater deficits in later years.
“I would put a plea out there that as you work on the thinking about your strategy for balancing fiscal ’27, that you try to make some headway for fiscal ’28,” when Romans said the budget challenge “is rather daunting.”
His comments came during a meeting Wednesday of the joint Spending Affordability Committee in one of the first briefings on the fiscal 2027 budget 0utlook.
Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a fiscal 2026 compromise budget that eliminated a projected $3.3 billion budget deficit through a combination of one-time fund transfers, budget cuts and $1.6 billion in taxes. Lawmakers believed that put them on solid ground for 2027, even though they knew that deficits in the billions could return in fiscal 2028 and beyond.
The latest budget projections hastened the return of those deficit projections by a year. After the projected fiscal 2027 budget gap of just under $1.5 billion, the structural budget deficit is expected to more than double in fiscal 2028 to $3.2 billion, before growing to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2029 and roughly $4 billion in fiscal years 2030 and 2031.
Budget concerns resurface as state faces projected $1.4 billion gap for coming year

“This isn’t about resources—it’s about restraint,” Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) said in a statement. “You can’t promise everything to everyone and then feign shock when the math doesn’t work.”
The largest driver of those costs is the K-12 education reform program known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. Lawmakers will likely have to make adjustments to how the plan is implemented in order to bend the curve on ongoing costs.
“I think the bottom line here is Marylanders have nothing left to give,” said Delegate Jefferson L. Ghrist (R-Upper Shore), a House Appropriations Committee member. “The Democratic supermajority continues to take, with historic increases in taxes and fees and an insatiable appetite for spending. Meanwhile, the government continues to grow, so the problem only gets worse.
“As massive as a $1.4 billion deficit is, the long-term projections to pay for the Blueprint in the coming years are staggering,” Ghrist said. “We knew this in 2020 when the Blueprint bill passed. The truth is, no matter who is in the White House, it was always going to be this way.”
In the near term, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said tax increases are off the table.
“This is not a time where we can go for increased revenues. Last session was brutal,” Ferguson said during a Wednesday morning interview on WBAL radio. “I think Marylanders are feeling costs everywhere, and so we are going to have to make some very hard decisions this year about how to bend the curve. We can’t keep this cycle up. This is not how we will grow, and growth is the only thing that will ultimately get us out of this.”
Republicans, however, said they fear more tax hikes are in the offing – if not now, then soon.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The 2026 session will be an Election Year Budget, and Democrats will do everything possible to paper over the problem until after November,” Ready said in his statement. “But Marylanders deserve honesty. Even if they delay new tax hikes this year, the out-years will be brutal. These programs are growing faster than our economy — and the bill is coming due.”
While dealing with the budget, Ferguson and the General Assembly also face the potential for a special legislative session to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts. Ferguson has opposed the effort, and in a statement to Maryland Matters, he implied that such a session would be a distraction from the budget.
“The highest and best use of the General Assembly’s time is keeping Maryland on strong fiscal footing by lowering costs for Maryland families and addressing the $1.4 billion structural deficit so we can meet our constitutional obligation to pass a balanced budget next session,” Ferguson said.
In Wednesday’s briefing, analysts presented a scenario in which lawmakers would pull nearly $1 billion from two accounts, the largest being the $815 million from the state’s rainy day account.
State law requires a minimum balance of 5% of general fund revenues be in the fund, which is meant as a bulwark against a severe economic downturn. Currently, the fund has $2.3 billion, about 8% of general fund revenues. By drawing down the fund, lawmakers could trim the projected deficit to a more manageable $500 million.
Panel recommends issuing up to $1.75 billion in bonds for coming fiscal year

“There are a number of downsides to that, but I want to highlight one: It does not provide any structural relief,” Romans said. “So, it doesn’t do anything for solving fiscal ’28.
“It also means you’ve spent that $800 million, so it’s not there to help you in the ’28 problem and it also isn’t there if we go into an actual recession, which is certainly a risk with the various federal cuts that seem to be continuing,” he said.
Romans described the balance as “pretty healthy” but added the amount is “is lower than typical for most of the other AAA-rated states.”
An October review of reserves held by all 50 states found Maryland could run state government for 29 days, compared to a 50-state median of 47 days, according to the Pew Charitable Trust Report.
Draining the reserve account to the bare minimum might harm the state’s credit rating. For more than five decades, the state enjoyed the highest rating from the three major bond rating agencies. Governors and lawmakers pointed to the so-called “triple triple-A bond rating” as a sign of their fiscal stewardship.
That changed in May, when Moody’s downgraded the state’s credit rating to Aa1.
The two other firms — Fitch and Standard & Poor’s — continued to give the state their highest rating. But both raised concerns about the costs of state government programs, including the Blueprint and pensions. They might take a dim view of the state tapping the rainy day fund rather than addressing ongoing costs and revenues, Romans said.
“The rating agencies that continue to rate us as AAA on our bonds have expressed concern,” Romans said. “One, about our structural budget challenge in the out years, and two, they’ve noted that our rainy day fund balance, while, pretty healthy at 8% for Maryland, is lower than typical for most of the other AAA-rated states. So, I think they would have concerns if we raid the rainy day fund balance, take it all the way down to 5% and aren’t making much progress on the structural challenge.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_5248-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 23:56:29.797118

Move by $80 billion crypto giant Coinbase highlights rising competition for Delaware’s incorporation business
WILMINGTON, Del. — Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is pulling its corporate charter out of Delaware and reincorporating in Texas — a high-profile defection that adds fuel to talk of a “Dexit” and raises fresh questions about one of Delaware’s most important revenue streams.
The company, founded in 2012 and long incorporated in Delaware, disclosed in a Wednesday filing that shareholders approved a plan to move its legal home to Texas. Coinbase is valued at roughly $80 billion, generated about $7.7 billion in revenue over the last year, and reported around $3.2 billion in net income, according to recent financial disclosures — making it one of the most profitable firms ever to walk away from Delaware’s corporate franchise.
Coinbase’s decision does not affect its largely remote workforce or day-to-day trading operations. Still, it severs a symbolic tie to a state that has spent decades marketing itself as the nation’s corporate capital.
What is ‘Dexit’?
Corporate lawyers have dubbed moves like Coinbase’s “Dexit” — short for “Delaware exit” — a catch-all term for companies that are relocating their legal domicile to other states.
Concerns about Dexit accelerated after Delaware’s Court of Chancery voided Elon Musk’s $56 billion Tesla compensation package in early 2024, despite shareholder approval. Musk responded by urging companies to avoid Delaware and later shifted Tesla and SpaceX to Texas, a move that emboldened other founders and investors to explore alternatives.
Since then, a growing list of public companies and investment firms — including Tesla, SpaceX, Andreessen Horowitz, Pershing Square Capital and others — have either left or publicly weighed leaving Delaware, often citing legal uncertainty and an uptick in shareholder litigation risk.
Texas and Nevada have aggressively courted those corporations with reforms that promise more predictable court treatment of boards and executives. Legal scholars note that while Delaware still dominates incorporation, Dexit has evolved from a social-media slogan into a real point of leverage for rival states.
Why Coinbase is leaving Delaware
In an opinion piece explaining the move, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said the company no longer sees Delaware’s courts as reliably business-friendly, warning of “surprises” and “politically charged rulings” that undermine board and shareholder expectations.
Recent decisions have expanded potential liability for controlling shareholders and directors, which critics say encourages more lawsuits and makes it harder for companies to predict outcomes in big-ticket cases.
Texas, by contrast, has created a specialized Business Court system and passed Senate Bill 29, which more explicitly protects the traditional “business judgment rule” — the idea that courts should defer to boards on most good-faith decisions.
For Coinbase, there’s also a political and industry angle. Texas has carved out a reputation as one of the country’s more crypto-friendly states, from hosting large Bitcoin mining operations to exploring a strategic Bitcoin reserve. CEO Brian Armstrong has aligned himself with pro-crypto, pro-business politicians and backed efforts to loosen digital-asset regulation at the federal level.
Roughly 78% of Coinbase’s voting power supported the switch, according to filings.
How much money is at stake for Delaware?
In sheer dollars, Coinbase is just one taxpayer among thousands. The immediate hit to Delaware’s books from a single reincorporation is likely to be modest.
The larger fear is what happens if Coinbase is a leading indicator.
Delaware’s state budget is unusually dependent on its role as a home for corporations and their “abandoned” financial assets:


Corporate franchise and related incorporation fees are projected at about $1.8 billion a year and are the state’s second-largest revenue source after personal income tax.


Unclaimed property — everything from uncashed checks to unused gift cards tied to Delaware-incorporated companies — adds another $400–550 million a year and accounts for roughly 6–7% of the state budget.


Taken together, those two corporate-driven streams represent roughly one-third of Delaware’s General Fund revenues, according to state reports and independent analyses. For fiscal 2025, Delaware budget officials forecast about $6.66 billion in General Fund revenue — meaning even a 5–10% erosion in franchise and unclaimed-property collections would force difficult choices on spending or taxes.
In March, Gov. Matt Meyer underscored the stakes when he defended a controversial bill aimed at reassuring billionaire founders that Delaware would remain attractive, saying the state “needs and wants those $2 billion in incorporation revenues every year, plus a related $420 million” from abandoned accounts as reported by WHYY on March 25, 2025.
Coinbase’s departure doesn’t blow a hole in that number by itself. But if large, profitable firms come to see Texas or Nevada as the safer default, Delaware could see its once-steady franchise cash cow turn choppy.
A warning shot for Delaware’s ‘corporate brand’
Analysts have long noted that Delaware’s advantage rests less on tax rates than on a trusted legal framework: a responsive Division of Corporations, an expert Court of Chancery and a well-understood body of corporate law.
Coinbase’s move calls that brand into question.
Credit analysts and business groups have already warned that Delaware’s heavy reliance on franchise and unclaimed-property revenues makes the state vulnerable to shifts in corporate behavior or federal court rulings. The recent MoneyGram unclaimed-property case and other challenges have shown how quickly hundreds of millions of dollars can be put at risk.
The Dexit drumbeat adds a second pressure point: competition.


Nevada markets itself as a low-litigation alternative and has been explicitly promoting Dexit to corporate counsel as reported in the Journal of Corporation Law.


Texas has paired legal reforms with a broader pro-business pitch and is now able to point to marquee names — Tesla, SpaceX and Coinbase among them — as proof of concept.


For now, Delaware still hosts more than half of U.S. public companies and the majority of the Fortune 500.  State lawmakers also updated parts of the corporate code this year in an effort to calm fears raised by Musk and other critics.
The question is whether moves like Coinbase’s will remain symbolic outliers — or signal a broader rebalancing of where America does business on paper.

What comes next for the Delaware economy?
Budget writers in Dover are watching closely.   If Dexit accelerates, Delaware could be forced to:


Diversify revenues away from franchise and unclaimed-property windfalls and toward more traditional taxes that fall directly on residents and in-state businesses.


Revisit corporate law changes that critics say have pushed boards and founders toward Texas and Nevada; and

But jousting continues among Republicans and Democrats — including those from Washington state — over who’s to blame for the longest ever shuttering of the federal government. The 43-day political meltdown jeopardized families’ food benefits, snarled air travel and left some federal employees working without pay.
Wednesday evening, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed the resolution 222-209 to fund parts of the federal government through the end of January and other parts through next fall. The Senate acted on Monday. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation.
Washington state’s House delegation voted as anticipated: Republican U.S. Reps. Dan Newhouse of Sunnyside and Michael Baumgartner of Spokane supported the measure along with one Democratic defector, U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Skamania County. Gluesenkamp Perez is known for breaking ranks with her party and faces a tough reelection fight next year.
The state’s other seven Democratic House members opposed the package.
“The performative tactics that we have watched over the last seven weeks have truly been a disservice to Americans,” U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, said in a floor speech before the final vote. “But the most important thing right now is that we get back to work making sure the federal government can provide the essential services that people depend on.”
In an interview, Newhouse said the lengthy shutdown didn’t help anybody and was glad some Democrats in the Senate “finally came to their senses” to open the government. “Republicans have been on the right of this from the beginning,” he said. 
Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, was among the many Democrats offering rebuttals in the hourlong debate preceding the vote.
“This bill fails to address the fundamental needs of families across our country,” she said, blaming the rising cost of health care premiums on Republicans’ opposition to extending Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.
“President Trump and Republicans promised to lower costs on day one, and that’s been one big broken promise,” DelBene said.
The MGP factor
Gluesenkamp Perez’s vote was one of the more closely watched. She is one of her party’s most vulnerable members in next year’s midterm election because her 3rd Congressional District leans Republican. Trump won it in 2024.
Her vote wasn’t surprising. When the House passed its original short-term continuing resolution in September, she missed the vote but said she would have supported it. 
In a statement Wednesday, she called the shutdown “a case study in why most Americans can’t stand Congress.”
“Americans can’t afford for their Representatives to get so caught up in landing a partisan win that they abandon their obligation to come together to solve the urgent problems that our nation faces,” she said.
Congress, she continued, needs to focus on the economy, health care and reestablishing “a truly deliberative democracy. I’ll work with whoever is necessary to reach those goals – and I don’t give a damn which side of the aisle they sit on,” she said.
Gluesenkamp Perez’s vote didn’t cost her the backing of DelBene, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm of House Democrats. 
“The reason we win is because we have representatives who are authentic to their communities,” DelBene said. “Unlike Republicans who are blindly loyal to Donald Trump, we have representatives who are going to make the decisions they think are best for their community.”
Shasti Conrad, chair of the state Democratic Party, said Gluesenkamp Perez’s focus on affordability and cost of living is the playbook that led to Democratic victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia this month.
Gluesenkamp Perez “will be a linchpin for Democrats to retake control of the House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections,” Conrad said.
Rep. Marilyn Strickland, D-Tacoma, skewered the Democratic senators who helped pass the continuing resolution. But she stood by her House colleague who sided with Republicans.
“She knows her district better than anyone, and we need her in the House,” Strickland said.
‘I am really proud’
Baumgartner gave a nod to the six House Democrats who crossed over.
“The Democrats’ decision to shut down the government was a monumental waste of time that hurt a lot of people,” he said. “I thank the Democrats who were willing to work across the aisle to end this needless shutdown and put country over party.”
There are hard feelings between some Democrats in each chamber, as they look to unite on the issue of health care and extending the tax credits.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, a leading progressive voice in the caucus, who opposed the resolution, said on social media that Senate Democrats “should not have caved.” She’s among a clutch of House Democrats supporting the ouster of Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer as Senate minority leader.
“I am really proud of House Democrats who stood up and fought back and refused to cave, and have been the wind behind the sails to make sure that the Senate held out as long as they did,” she said on social media. “This was a righteous fight for the health care of the American people.”
Up next
Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, has said the Senate will hold a vote by mid-December on the issue of health care subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, are reportedly negotiating on the content of what will reach the floor.
House Democrats want a three-year extension of the tax credits and are trying to get a majority of the chamber to sign onto a petition to force a vote on the proposal.
DelBene said many Republicans have said they think the tax credits need to be extended. 
“If they’re serious about that, they have the opportunity to join us to move that legislation forward,” she said.
Newhouse said he’s open to further debate on health care.
“What’s called the Affordable Care Act has become an unaffordable care law,” he said. “I don’t see a clean extension happening. There would have to be some reforms instituted.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmay72025-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-13 02:47:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT delegation opposes shutdown deal over health care subsidies,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/government-shutdown-house-deal-ct/,CT Democrats said they will continue to fight to extend premium subsidies that will soon expire for Affordable Care Act health plans.,"The House returned Wednesday after a nearly two-month break and took the final step toward ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, but members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, who opposed the deal because it didn’t extend health care subsidies, were not counted among the yes votes.
All five members of Connecticut’s delegation joined most House Democrats in voting against the funding package that will reopen the government after 43 days. They rejected the Senate’s shutdown deal mainly because it made no guarantee to extend enhanced premium subsidies that will soon expire for those on Affordable Care Act health plans — or in Connecticut, the state’s marketplace Access Health CT. They also objected to the absence of submarine funding in the measure.
As part of the deal, Senate Republican leadership promised to hold a vote by the second week of December on an extension, though the House hasn’t committed to such a vote. The funding package also includes three separate bills to fund parts of the government through fiscal year 2026, in addition to a short-term bill for the remaining agencies only through Jan. 30.
The bill does guarantee back pay for furloughed federal workers — a requirement of a 2019 law — though President Donald Trump has suggested at times they might not get paid. It also reverses layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, which were already paused by federal judges. The bill passed in a nearly party-line vote, 222-209. Trump will sign the bill Wednesday night, marking the official end to the shutdown.
“The whole exercise was pointless, it was wrong, it was cruel,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. said shortly before the vote, noting the airline disruptions and missed paychecks for federal workers. “We’re not going to let them succeed in that game.”
The fate of health care subsidies is uncertain at best. They are set to expire on Dec. 31 if there’s no congressional action. If they expire, those who only receive the enhanced tax credit would see their premiums rise in 2026, while those who earn less than 400% of the federal poverty level would get less assistance than they do now.
In the coming weeks, House Democrats will try to force a vote on the issue through a difficult procedural move. Across the U.S. Capitol, the Senate is expected to take it up, though passage in that chamber is far from guaranteed. 
But Democrats, including those in Connecticut, don’t want to stop fighting for an outcome they believe their constituents want, particularly after their strong showing in last week’s elections in the state and across the country.
“I don’t think we can concede defeat just based on what [House Speaker] Mike Johnson is going to do,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said. “I think we keep doing what we’re doing, making sure that the American people know what’s at stake.”
Health care fight continues
In a last-ditch effort, House Democrats are going to use a rarely used — and rarely successful — procedure to force a floor vote as the minority party. By using the vehicle known as a discharge petition, Democrats will need to garner 218 signatures to secure a vote on a three-year extension of the subsidies.
That means they’ll need at least a few Republicans to sign on, which will be a tough sell.  Some moderate Republicans, however, have been supportive of a one-year subsidies extension through a bipartisan bill.
Senate GOP leadership promised to hold a vote on the ACA enhanced subsidies by the second week of December, but it’s unclear if enough Republican senators would support such a measure. If all Senate Democrats backed the bill, they would need to sway seven GOP senators to get it to clear the 60-vote threshold.
It’s even more unlikely the House will take it up before the subsidies expire at the end of next month. A vote in the House wasn’t part of the shutdown deal, and Speaker  Johnson hasn’t made any commitments.
“I’m not promising anybody anything. I’m going to let this process play out,” Johnson said at a recent press conference.
Connecticut Democrats have vowed to keep pushing for an extension of the subsidies if the effort fails next month. 
Congress could be grappling with these same issues early next year since short-term funding for most government agencies runs out by the end of January. If lawmakers can’t pass the rest of the full-year appropriations bills, they would need to once again rely on another funding patch known as a continuing resolution.
“When we come to Jan. 30, we will see what progress has been made. Johnson said he won’t guarantee a vote in the House. The Senate says they will have a vote. Do I trust any of them? Hell no,” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, said.
As the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, DeLauro plays a major role in negotiating the remaining nine spending bills and has a little over two months to hash out an agreement with Republican lawmakers on the committee.
With the House on recess for more than 50 days, DeLauro said they lost critical time on negotiations. And there’s not much time left in the year given the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.
“Fifty four days, we could have been working on appropriations bills. We have nine more bills to go,” DeLauro said. “So we will see. My concern is that we’re going to be here in the same situation on Jan. 30.”
That leaves little time for work on appropriations and Democrats’ push for a subsidies extension with the next funding deadline set for Jan. 30.
“We should have been working on this literally every day before now. We should have been working on this when we knew the subsidies were going to expire,” Hayes said. “We could have had bipartisan conversations.”
“I think that we’re going to still be fighting. I know that I’m going to keep fighting to try to get these health care subsidies for my constituents,” she continued. “I’m hoping that we don’t end up in another shutdown situation because people know how devastating that is, but that means we gotta work every day until then.”
No funding for Columbia-class subs
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, noted the omission of funding for the Columbia-class submarine program as another red flag. He said the Senate “dropped the ball” on that front in the negotiations, particularly with the House out of town for the past 54 days.
When Congress passes short-term bills like continuing resolutions that keep most government functions running at current funding levels, lawmakers can use what’s known as “anomalies” to make adjustments to funding levels. 
Courtney, the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said that program has gotten anomalies in past budgets because it is viewed as a top priority for the U.S. Navy. And he noted that the White House had submitted its request for an anomaly of about $3.9 billion for the Columbia-class submarines, but it was left out of both the original short-term bill and the one that just passed the House.
“They made a judgment call that it was such a short-duration [continuing resolution] that it was not really as critical to have an anomaly for it,“ Courtney said, referring to the original short-term bill that funded the government through Nov. 21.  “But now we’re talking Jan. 30, and that’s where the Navy’s request really made sense if you were going to treat this as the priority program which it always has been given.” 
The continuing resolution, however, included anomaly funding for the Virginia-class submarine program. 
Electric Boat is the lead contractor on the nuclear-powered ballistic missile vessels to replace the Groton-based company’s Ohio-class submarines. It works alongside Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia on the construction of those subs. Both of those companies work on the Virginia-class program.
The goal of the Navy is to produce two Virginia-class and one Columbia-class a year, though there are delays in the production cadence impacting that goal, according to a March report from the Congressional Research Service.
“There was an assumption that they were going to do an anomaly for it, and it’s zero,” Courtney said. “To me, it just shows not having the House here and just letting these senators who, in my opinion, didn’t pay attention to the priority of keeping schedule, given the age of those boats, that’s what happens.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25316821370012-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047

The state’s hospital-rate setting commission gave an overview Wednesday of some of the terms laid out in a future agreement with federal officials to transition the state into a federal program called the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
There are still some details to work out, some that may take several years to complete, officials said. But the new model will let the state retain some of the authority it has now to set rates and global budgets for hospitals, even if there is more federal involvement than in the prior system.
“This is going to be an ongoing discussion,” Jonathan Kromm, executive director for the Health Services Cost Review Commission, said at the Wednesday meeting. “With a two-year time window before some significant changes happen.”
The comments come as the finalized AHEAD model is expected to be signed in the near future.
Caution AHEAD: State officials nervous for Maryland hospitals under Trump administration

Maryland’s current system, called the Total Cost of Care model, allows the state to set annual payments to hospitals in advance but includes patient outcome goals — reducing readmissions, for example — as incentives.
With that system ending this year, state health officials have been working out a new system with federal agencies. Maryland was one of the first states, with Vermont, selected by the Biden administration last year to implement the new AHEAD model.
The federal AHEAD program is actually modeled on Maryland’s Total Cost of Care system and took inspiration from similar models in Vermont and Pennsylvania.
Gov. Wes Moore signed an agreement with Biden administration officials last November on terms of the AHEAD model, but the incoming Trump administration put that plan on hold so it could take another look at the model agreement and make some changes.
The state has been negotiating with officials at the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) on the revised AHEAD model since February. The parties appear to be near an agreement, as the HSCRC is now mapping out what policy changes are ahead for the commission.
One of the major changes is that Maryland will likely lose its ability to set Medicare rates, an authority that’s been in place for about 40 years under a waiver granted by CMMI.
In the time since, the state’s health care system has evolved and the HSCRC now determines the rates for care across all hospitals in the state, so that health care service costs are similar whether someone has private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.
Draft terms of the revised AHEAD model indicate that Maryland is set to lose the authority to set Medicare rates. That could have ripple effects on rates for Medicaid and private insurance, due to the state’s all-payer model that aims to keep costs for health care consistent across the board, according to health care advocates.
Thousands of Maryland seniors notified of the end of their Medicare Advantage plans

That said, the new agreement seems to also prompt Maryland to “stabilize” the state’s uniquely challenging Medicare Advantage market.
Insurance carriers say that Maryland’s current hospital system is costly for them to do business in. This is leading to several carriers pulling out of the state or reducing their coverage, kicking thousands of retirees off their health care plans in the process.
The revised agreement still aims to track population health as the previous agreement had, but adds a new emphasis on finding new ways to enhance choice and competition in the health care market. The HSCRC is also expected to “determine services that could be carved out of global budgets” while still meeting population health goals and hospital revenues.
As the state moves closer to this change, HSCRC Commissioner ​Nicki McCann said it will be an opportunity to track the effectiveness of the state’s hospital model going forward.
“What we’re doing is meaningless if we’re not improving the health of Marylanders, and so I think this is critically important to measure success of this over the long term,” she said during the meeting.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/ct-emergency-relief-fund-lamont-legislature/,Vanishing federal subsidies and stricter benefits rules threaten health care and nutrition aid for thousands of Connecticut households now.,"This story has been updated.
The state House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a $500 million emergency fund late Wednesday to bolster social service programs threatened by the longest federal government shutdown in national history.
The House voted 126-20 to approve the bill following a two-and-a-half-hour debate, with 28 out of 48 Republicans siding with all 98 Democrats to back the measure. Because creating the emergency fund potentially could push Connecticut over its budgetary spending cap, the measure had to pass with at least a 60% majority, which meant at least 90 supportive votes in the House.
But given that the 43-day shutdown is nearing its end, the House debate was more a prelude of a larger discussion expected to continue for years: Should Connecticut tap its wealth to temper the deep, longer-lasting cuts to federal human service programs ordered last July by President Trump and Congress?
While many cutbacks to Medicaid don’t start for two more years, vanishing federal subsidies and stricter benefits rules threaten health care and nutrition aid for thousands of Connecticut households now.
“This bill is really about our job to protect our families, particularly in the wake of Washington’s failure to act,” said Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, who added the shutdown “has wreaked havoc on households across our state.”
Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on the finance committee, who voted for the bill, said, “Our politicians in D.C., on both sides of the aisle, ought to be ashamed of themselves.”
But as Congress late Wednesday approved a temporary federal funding measure — allowing the shutdown to end in the coming days — Polletta added that, “I don’t think there’s going to be a need for this fund.”
“This government shutdown has ended,” said Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott. “At the end of the day, this bill is not necessary at all.”
The measure before the Democratic-controlled state House would set aside one-fifth of last fiscal year’s historic $2.5 billion state budget surplus to aid those harmed by the shutdown — or by any other federal budget cuts — between now and the end of the state’s fiscal year on June 30, 2026.
The state Senate, where Democrats also hold a majority, will debate the emergency fund Thursday.
Gov. Ned Lamont, who already has announced his support for the measure, could tap this $500 million pool to bolster the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and six other human service programs. These include: a second nutrition assistance program that serves women, infants and children; school meals; winter heating and energy assistance; Medicaid; and federal child care and housing assistance grants.
Any of the $500 million that remains unspent by July 1 of next year would be used to retire Connecticut’s hefty pension debt, which exceeded $35 billion entering last fiscal year, according to Lamont’s budget office.
Is CT response fund needed with federal shutdown ending?
But just as Polletta and Mastrofrancesco questioned the need for any state intervention once the federal government shutdown has ended, others said Connecticut needs to do more for years to come — unless Washington reverses a dangerous trend of cutting back aid to states.
“The fact is that so many working people throughout this state struggled — prior to the federal shutdown, prior to the federal budget cuts,” said Rep. Brandon Chafee, D-Middletown.
“I know people in my community that are going hungry,” said Rep. Anthony Nolan, a Democrat from New London, one of the state’s poorest communities. “I know people in my community that are watering down milk to make milk last longer.”
“For people to say that there are no emergencies,” Nolan added, “that is ridiculous.”
The Trump administration since last spring has used a host of legal maneuvers to block health care, education, nutrition and other federal aid to Connecticut.
Majority Democrats in the General Assembly also began talking — months before any federal government shutdown — about tapping Connecticut’s coffers to offset the big cuts in federal assistance pursued by President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, ordered more than $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to help finance roughly $4.5 trillion in tax relief — breaks aimed chiefly at high-earning households.
The bulk of those spending cuts involved Medicaid, an omnibus program that supports medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, and nursing home and in-home care. It also supports hospitals and federally qualified health centers that treat uninsured and underinsured patients.
Congress and Trump also imposed stricter work requirements that could remove about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness from SNAP eligibility in Connecticut between Dec. 1 and March 31.
And starting Jan. 1, Washington will cancel subsidies that help people afford health coverage through through state-based insurance exchanges like Access Health CT. The cost to consumers here is projected at almost $300 million per year.
“Do we want to start thinking about hiring more people to make sure we can deal with Medicaid changes?” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, asked during a Wednesday morning press conference. “Do we want to put more money to Medicaid, potentially? How do you want to deal with SNAP benefits and the reductions that we’ve seen there?”
State Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said last week Connecticut should immediately explore options to help families cope with a huge, impending jump in health insurance costs.
But tempering ongoing federal cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and health insurance subsidies likely would require state appropriations of hundreds of millions of dollars year after year — not just diverting dollars from a temporary, $500 million emergency fund.
Many Democrats in the General Assembly have said Connecticut easily could afford to help. The state has used aggressive budget caps and savings rules in place since 2017 to force annual surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion over the past eight years. That’s a total currently represents more than 8% of the General Fund.
Those surpluses, created by drawing dollars from health care, education, municipal aid and other core programs, have been used to retire state pension debt faster than Connecticut has in the past. But analysts say, even at this aggressive pace, that debt won’t be eliminated until well into the 2040s.
“It’s time that we re-examined how we do our budget in this state,” Chafee said, adding that asking one generation to solve a debt problem created by three is unfair. “We’re asking the current generation of taxpayers to pay off the whole bill. It’s ridiculous while people are struggling.”
Leaders of the General Assembly’s Republican minority said last week that Connecticut should tap its reserves to assist the state’s roughly 360,000 SNAP recipients who lost benefits when the shutdown entered its second month on Nov. 1. Lamont, who originally was reluctant to commit state dollars to fund those benefits, agreed to do so last Friday, and payments to households resumed Saturday.
Now, with the federal shutdown expected to end, not all Republicans in the state House said Connecticut can afford to drop its guard.
State House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford pledged to support the $500 million response fund during a press conference prior to the House debate.
“What we are doing today points to a failure at the federal level,” Candelora said. “And we cannot have government holding individuals hostage to try to get what they want — either party — and it’s something in Connecticut we don’t do.”
Will Lamont tap CT’s coffers to protect social services, health care?
But Lamont will play a huge role in whether Connecticut taps it coffers — for even a few months, let alone for years to come — to replace vanishing federal aid for social services.
According to the legislation the state House passed, Lamont has sole authority to propose expenditures from that pool. But a 6-member panel of state legislative leaders — which includes the House and Senate majority and minority leaders along with the House speaker and Senate president pro tem — can block any spending with a simple majority vote.
The governor already has been using small amounts of funds from the state’s basic pool of operating cash, to replace stalled federal funding for nutrition assistance for women, infants and children and also for heating assistance. Connecticut had commitments from the Trump administration that Washington would reimburse any state dollars advanced in these areas after the shutdown.
In other words, that won’t cost the state anything.
Lamont did pledge last Friday to commit as much as $72 million in state funds, if necessary, to cover November SNAP benefits stalled by the shutdown. But he did so only after hundreds of thousands of SNAP recipients here already had gone one week with no benefits — and amid public appeals from legislative leaders from both parties.
The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would cover the November SNAP benefits costs promptly after the shutdown ends, Politico reported.
A fiscally moderate Democrat, Lamont has traditionally been wary of using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
When asked last week whether he would support a state-funded SNAP benefit to protect the 36,000 recipients affected by new work requirements, the governor said only that officials would consider it.
Will SNAP crisis boost support for universal free school meals?
Also Wednesday, advocates for Connecticut funding free school breakfast and lunch for all students said they hoped to use the recent SNAP crisis to build support for their cause.
Representatives of End Hunger CT and the American Heart Association appealed to state legislators to consider funding the service when the 2026 session resumes in slightly less than three months.
“The crisis over SNAP funding has highlighted the very real problem of food insecurity here in Connecticut,” said Amari Brantley, policy coordinator for End Hunger CT. “The restoration of federal funding is welcome, but Connecticut cannot ignore the working families who will continue to fall through the cracks.
Connecticut had offered free meals during the 2023-24 academic year but pulled back due to state budget constraints.
Advocates for universal free meals have said Connecticut could offset most or all costs of the program by establishing a sales tax surcharge on sweetened beverages.
“We know that one of the most effective solutions to food insecurity is feeding all the kids at school and we are encouraging lawmakers to support funding in the 2026 session,” Brantley added.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1112_SR_SpecialSession_004-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047

There have been 135 veterans who have graduated from the Central Maryland Regional Veterans Treatment Court since its inception in 2015, including five who graduated Wednesday during the treatment court’s 10th anniversary celebration in Baltimore. The program typically takes 18 months to complete. Over the 10 years the program has been in place, there have been 24 unsuccessful graduations.
“Anybody who works in the criminal justice system knows that those kinds of numbers are astounding,” said District Court Senior Judge Halee F. Weinstein, the founder of the program and a veteran herself. “But they are not just numbers — they are people.”
The court originally only served veterans from Baltimore City, and now has been open to veterans from Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties for about a year. The central Maryland program has 44 active participants — about twice as many as last year, when it expanded to a regional court.
“That is double the amount of veterans who have had the ability to rebuild their lives,” said Belvedere, who will soon assume his role as a veteran mentor coordinator for both the District Court in Anne Arundel and the Central Maryland Regional Veterans Treatment Court.
Belvedere hopes that the decision to expand will be an example for other court programs, emphasizing that this is “just the beginning.” He noted the “ripple effects” the program has in the community, such as multigenerational impacts and the ways in which veterans who have completed the program give back to the community — some becoming veteran mentors themselves or finding other ways to use their experience to help others.
Veteran treatment programs are offered in 13 counties across the state through the District Court in Anne Arundel County, the Central Maryland Regional Veterans Treatment Court, the Dorchester County District Regional Veterans Court, the Circuit Court for Prince George’s County and the Frederick and Washington County Regional Veterans Treatment Court.
“I’d like to thank the judge for offering grace — if that’s what it is — to veterans who need the time to reflect on their lives,” said retired Army Col. Edna W. Cummings, who spoke at the ceremony.

Cummings encouraged veterans to write down stories from their service, pushing each of them to reflect on the significance of the role they played in leading a unit or organization to its success.
“I like to think that the military sent each of us to a superpower training camp — it’s designed to bring out our strengths we didn’t know we had,”  she said. “Once you document your story, you too will realize your superpowers.”
Program graduates on Wednesday each approached the front of the room to share words with Weinstein, with whom the veterans had regular status hearings during their time in the program. Each veteran shared a moment, complete with both laughs and emotional sentiments, with their mentor and Weinstein before taking a photo in front of the flag that represented their respective service.
“I get to look at not the person who I was, but the person I became as a result of using drugs and getting into all that negative stuff. Now I get to be the person I truly am — who I was raised to be,” said Kevin Johnson, a veteran who graduated Wednesday. “It’s just a really good feeling to be able to feel this way.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request to stay two lower court orders requiring her to set earlier special election dates for two legislative vacancies Wednesday evening.
The court also rejected a request by Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office to consolidate the two cases.
Arkansas judge rules against Sanders in second special election lawsuit

The identical orders, which did not explain the justices’ reasoning, granted the state’s motions for expedited consideration of its appeals of the orders handed down by two Pulaski County Circuit judges last month. Associate Justice Rhonda Wood would have granted the request for a faster briefing schedule, according to the order. Associate Justice Barbara Webb did not participate.
“I am disappointed by the rulings and will continue to vigorously defend the Governor and Secretary of State,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said via a spokesperson. Griffin’s office is representing Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester in both lawsuits.
Sanders set special elections for the Senate District 26 and House District 27 seats earlier this year, after Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch died and Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock resigned to lead Arkansas PBS in September.. However, her decision to set the special elections for June 2026 — after the Legislature’s fiscal session in April — immediately generated bipartisan criticism and lawsuits from SD 26 and HD 70 voters, as well as the Democratic Party of Arkansas, who said it would deprive them of representation for important legislative deliberations on issues like education and prison funding.
Under Arkansas law, the governor is required to schedule a special election date to fill a vacancy within 150 days unless she found it was “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election couldn’t be held within 150 days, it had to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
‘Far-reaching ramifications’: Judge says special election dates violate constitutional rights

A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Judges in both lawsuits sided with the plaintiffs and ordered Sanders to schedule the elections earlier, finding that the June 2026 dates were impermissible under state law and the U.S. and Arkansas constitutions, though the reasoning varied between the cases. In the HD 70 case, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson explicitly ordered Sanders to set the general special election for March 3, 2026. In the SD 26 case, Judge Patricia James said Sanders needed to set it “as soon as practicable” after the 150-day deadline, but did not specify when.
Sanders subsequently appealed those orders to the Arkansas Supreme Court, asking the justices to consolidate the cases into a single appeal and put the lower court decisions on hold.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AR-SUPREME-CT-JCSR9975.jpg,,,2025-11-12 21:58:02.108047

As expected, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo on Wednesday issued the proclamation calling legislators to convene in Carson City at 10 a.m. Thursday.
Lombardo will also be asking legislators to pass a crime bill he championed during the regular session of the Legislature earlier this year. Like the film tax credit proposal, the crime bill met its demise as the regular session was winding down. Both measures have been publicly discussed for months as likely items during a legislative special session. 
Another half dozen laws that failed to make it across the finish line when the regular session ended in June will also be making a reappearance before lawmakers, including a bill that aims to relieve Nevada’s health care provider shortage, a juvenile safety bill, and some statutory housekeeping measures.
Lombardo’s proclamation also includes what is for a special session a large number of other issues, ranging from cybersecurity prevention to school zone safety to fire trucks for the state Division of Forestry.
“Nevadans deserve action now – not years from now – on legislation that implements critical public safety measures, expands healthcare access, and supports good-paying jobs,” Lombardo said in a press release accompanying the proclamation.

States like New York and Vermont have also taken a hard look at their emissions mandates in light of clean energy shortfalls.,"OF ALL THE impacts President Trump is having on Massachusetts, one of the most significant is the constraints he is putting on our efforts to bring clean energy online. From canceled wind contracts to ending tax credits, almost overnight the Commonwealth has found itself confronting a new reality when it comes to energy and climate ambitions – and a new bill in the House is poised to help us confront that reality. 
Massachusetts has certainly led on climate over the years. Beginning with passage of the Green Communities Act and Global Warming Solutions Act in 2008, the Commonwealth has addressed greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation. With increasingly aggressive emissions mandates—a 50 percent reduction by 2030, 75 percent by 2040 and net zero by 2050—the state has dramatically expanded energy efficiency programs and encouraged the development of solar, geothermal, energy storage, and offshore wind – while transitioning away from natural gas to a system that relies primarily on electricity.  
Unfortunately, even as the dates for these mandates get closer, they remain unrealized. Today, only about a quarter of Massachusetts’s electricity is renewable – more than half of which comes from not solar or offshore wind power but the burning of wood and waste.  
Meanwhile, offshore wind projects that would provide enough energy to power more than a million homes—Southcoast Wind (1,100 megawatts) and New England Wind I (800 megawatts)—have been delayed and now contract negotiations are not expected to be completed until next year at the earliest, with new energy solicitations being put on hold. In fact, only two large clean energy projects are under construction: the 1,200 megawatt transmission line delivering hydropower from Canada, and the 800 megawatt Vineyard Wind 1 offshore wind project – neither of which will move the needle on greenhouse gas emissions within the next five years.  
So, as the Legislature considers Gov. Healey’s energy affordability bill, the question becomes: Do Massachusetts leaders need to re-think our 2030 emissions mandates? 
Rep. Mark Cusack, who leads House energy policy as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, has introduced legislation to shift Massachusetts’s 2030 emissions target from a mandate to advisory goal – maintaining the 2050 net-zero objective, while allowing flexibility to protect households and businesses. His bill would also address rising energy costs, in part by creating an affordability and competitiveness standard to ensure the Commonwealth’s emissions efforts will not impose unreasonable adverse impacts on the cost or availability of energy.  
The longer we wait, the harder it’s going to be. In part, that’s because policies designed to incentivize zero emissions fuels and constrain our use of natural gas and leave us increasingly dependent on the one fuel everyone agrees Massachusetts shouldn’t be using: oil.  
While we all remember the spike in energy costs from last winter, less attention was paid to the negative climate impact during the coldest days when gas was in short supply. On January 22, 2025, the region required 20,000 megawatts of electricity to meet demand – the most all season. Cold winter spikes in electric use are not unusual. What was unusual is that about 30 percent of the electricity used this time was not generated by clean sources or even natural gas, but by oil. Greenhouse gas emissions averaged around 137 metric tons per minute.  
Only a year earlier, when the region’s peak electricity demand reached 18,300 megawatts on January 17, 2024, emissions averaged about 85 metric tons per minute most of the day. Why? Because natural gas was available. In a single year, a 10 percent increase in electricity usage drove up emissions by 60 percent.  
With ratepayer-funded rebates encouraging installation of up to 500,000 heat pumps—which cost between $20,000 to $30,000 apiece—adding stress to our already overburdened electricity grid, the problem will only get worse and more expensive.  
As bad as this all sounds—and it is bad—Gov. Healey is smart to leave all options on the table. 
Last month her administration announced a partnership with the University of Massachusetts Lowell to accelerate the state’s leadership in advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. Additionally, she reiterated her commitment to an “all-of-the above” approach to energy resources, specifically noting that natural gas “continues to play an important role in our overall energy supply.” 
Massachusetts isn’t the only progressive state reassessing this challenge. States like New York and Vermont have also taken a hard look at their emissions mandates in light of clean energy shortfalls. Even California is rethinking its environmental codes in light of housing construction shortfalls. They recognize that increasing costs with little or no practical emission reduction is not only counterproductive but—with a hostile Administration in Washington—an increasingly urgent issue to address.  
For more than a decade, Massachusetts climate strategy has effectively traded higher emissions, higher costs, and less reliability today for a promise of lower emissions tomorrow. But a promise is far from a guarantee – and with 2030 almost upon us, tomorrow still isn’t here.

(Photo by Ian Karbal/The Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The last state in the nation without some form of a budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year finally has a spending plan in place.
Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a $50.1 billion state budget Wednesday after intensive meetings between Republican and Democratic lawmakers in recent weeks. They had been deadlocked for nearly five months since the June 30 deadline. 
The budget, Shapiro’s third, increases overall spending by 4.7% compared to the previous year but represents a $1.4 billion reduction from his proposal in February. 
Before signing the bills that make up the spending plan, Shapiro noted leaders from the House and Senate had worked through the summer and fall and rejected calls by some Republicans to slash healthcare spending and other critical programs.

“We stayed at the table. We refused to accept inaction,” Shapiro said. “Because my top priority has been delivering a budget that makes a meaningful impact on the good people of Pennsylvania.” 
Shapiro stressed that the spending plan is balanced, reduces taxes and preserves the state’s roughly $7 billion rainy day fund. 
It continues a phased reduction in the state’s corporate net income tax to 7.49% and provides a state earned income tax credit for low- and moderate-income families that will provide $193 million in tax relief. It also projects that the state will end this fiscal year with $8 billion in its rainy day fund.
In a major concession for some Democrats, Republican lawmakers won a long-sought policy goal by getting Shapiro to withdraw from a regional greenhouse gas reduction program they likened to a tax on energy and a drag on economic growth in the commonwealth. And it includes reforms to environmental permitting that advocates say make Pennsylvania more business friendly.

“This budget took much longer than expected but ultimately Senate Republicans held the line to keep our promise to the people of Pennsylvania by not raising taxes and ensuring our state savings account – the rainy day fund – was not attacked,” Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward said. “It is important for Pennsylvanians to know this budget is the direct result of a divided government and two very different approaches to how we govern our state and partner with the federal government.”
Ward added Senate Republicans compromised by agreeing to spend more than the $47.6 billion they proposed in August.
House Appropriations Committee Chairperson Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said before the vote that although the budget was late, it reflects the shared interests of rural, urban and suburban Pennsylvanians.
“This budget represents us coming together to recognize that while everyone may not have gotten everything, that we can work together collectively … to have a document that we can be proud of that delivers on the promises that many of us have made to the people,” Harris said.
It passed the House with a 156-47 vote and a 40-9 tally in the Senate.
“This budget builds on the progress we’ve made to be able to deliver better schools and more opportunity for our kids, because I believe every single child deserves the freedom to chart their own course and the opportunity to succeed,” Shapiro said.

It continues an increase in funding to put the commonwealth’s most underfunded schools on an equal footing while enacting reforms to control what taxpayers must spend for privately run cyber charter schools. The state’s 500 school districts will receive $785 million or 7.5% more compared to the 2024-2025 budget.
That includes an additional $565 million in adequacy funding to address a state court’s finding that the reliance on property taxes to fund education put students in less wealthy communities at a disadvantage. The program will be expanded to ensure every district receives at least $50,000, although a majority will receive more to make up for decades of funding disparity.
“This budget shows bipartisan consensus that the march to constitutional school funding is not optional. It took too long, but we moved one year closer to a system that will transform lives,” Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, senior attorney with the Public Interest Law Center that helped win the lawsuit over education funding, said.
School districts will also be permitted to deduct more from the per-pupil tuition they’re required to pay for students who attend online charter schools. It’s estimated the changes will reduce the cost by an estimated $178 million statewide. 
Other cyber charter school reforms include a requirement for teachers to see and communicate with students at least once a week to help ensure student welfare in the wake of several child abuse cases that went unnoticed because the children weren’t attending school in person.
Susan Spicka, executive director of Education Voters PA, said the reforms are a “significant step toward reining in wasteful spending by the cyber charter industry and creating accountability for cyber operators to ensure that their students are supported, safe, and actually attending school.”

Republican leaders said Wednesday after the budget bills passed that enacting policies to foster economic and job growth, such as the withdrawal from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), are essential to the sustainability of state government. 
“We would be in a situation in a couple years where we simply would not have the money to fund any budget that is anywhere close to what we have now, let alone increases in the future,” House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said in a news conference.
RGGI aims to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by requiring the companies that own them to invest in clean energy projects. The multi-state program has been in place in about a dozen mid-Atlantic and northeastern states for more than a decade.
But Topper and other Republicans have said the program, which former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf entered by executive order in 2019, restrained the state’s ability to make use of its vast natural gas resources. Pennsylvania’s participation in the program has been on hold as state courts sorted out challenges questioning whether it is constitutional.
Environmentalists spoke out against abandoning RGGI last week as it became clear the program was a bargaining chip in ongoing negotiations. Amanda Leland, managing director at EDF Action, said Wednesday the compromise needlessly abandoned a promising tool for lowering energy costs and cutting pollution.
“Pennsylvanians are calling for cleaner air, lower energy bills and a responsible state budget — not for their governor to lock the state into dirty, expensive energy sources of the past,” Leland said.
Shapiro said he still plans to pursue an alternative plan that keeps energy investments by carbon emitters in the commonwealth and positions the state as an energy exporter. But Topper told the Capital-Star that no programs similar to RGGI would get consideration in the General Assembly.
“We’re trying to address costs,” he said. “I do not believe that natural gas development is a threat to the environment. So, no, I don’t think anything needs to happen to replace it,” Topper said.
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said the permitting reforms that are included in the budget package are also essential to Pennsylvania improving its competitiveness. They would streamline the Department of Environmental Protection’s review process for air and water quality impacts and require the agency to meet deadlines or permits would be automatically approved. 
Pittman pointed to an announcement Wednesday by Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel that it plans to build a new plant in Arkansas.
“The governor of Arkansas made the comment at the time that we put shovels in the ground faster than Pennsylvania issues permits,” Pittman said. “That type of bureaucracy is not acceptable. And so what we have done here has completely changed the paradigm.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Voters who did not follow a new Montana law requiring electors write their birth year on the envelope of an absentee ballot had the chance to fix the issue if they responded to a call, mailed notice or email from their local election department, but thousands of ballots still ended up in the rejected pile when all the counting was finalized. 
According to the Secretary of State’s office, “only one percent” of ballots were rejected due to a missing or mismatched birth year. However, some counties had rejection rates significantly higher than one percent, and almost all large counties saw higher rates than previous elections. 
The Secretary of State’s office did not provide any aggregate data showing the statewide rejection rate, and did not respond to several questions from the Daily Montanan about the new process, including specifics about cases of potential fraud the office said were prevented due the new law. 
In a press release, the office celebrated a successful election across the state, and the new law which allowed “election officials to efficiently and securely verify each voter.” 
In Yellowstone County, 31,563 ballots were accepted, and 1,400 total ballots were initially rejected, according to election administrator Dayna Causby, nearly 4.5%. 
Of the rejected ballots, roughly 1,100 were rejected due to a missing or incorrect birth year. 
While more than 800 ballots were resolved by voters notified about the error, the rejection rate after all resolutions was 2.03%.
During the last municipal election in 2023, that rate was 0.78%. 
Billings had a mayoral race that was decided by less than 200 votes — while final rejected ballots that were not counted in the election were three times that margin. 
“It was definitely a strain for voters whose ballot was rejected who had to come in and fix that,” Causby told the Daily Montanan. “We’re definitely already strategizing on how to mitigate this for future elections. Not just Yellowstone, but all the counties in the state.”
Outreach about the new law, House Bill 719, varied by county. 
Lewis and Clark County had some of the highest outreach, due to holding a City of Helena primary election a few weeks before the general election. While HB 719 wasn’t officially in effect during that September election, county officials treated it as a way to educate voters on the new changes. 
The work showed, as Lewis and Clark County had the lowest percent of rejected ballots among the most populous counties. 
Just 0.9% of ballots in the county were rejected, according to the election office. 
“Anytime you change the process for voters, even if it’s a minor change, you’re going to want to find a way to tell them about it,” Elections administrator Connor Fitzpatrick told the Daily Montanan leading up to election day. 
Fitzpatrick said the trial run with the primary, combined with sending out mailers to registered voters seemed to do the trick. 
“It looks like our outreach did connect with people,” he said. 
 In Gallatin County, three staff members were tasked with calling voters on Election Day to let them know their ballots had been rejected, but less than half of voters contacted resolved them. 
“We certainly had many more rejections this election, so many more votes didn’t count compared to past municipal elections,” Gallatin County Election Administrator Eric Semerad told the Daily Montanan. “Some of those voters may be upset that their votes were not counted. You can see that 377 voters did resolve their ballots after we contacted them this election, suggesting that voters do value their votes, even in these smaller municipal elections.”
Gallatin County recorded 820 rejected ballots, 626 of which were rejected due to a missing or incorrect birth year. The county’s total rejection rate was 3.74%, and the rejection rate after ballots were resolved was 2.05%.
Semerad said ballots seemed to get better as the election progressed as voters learned about the new process, and he said he thinks elections in 2026 will be better. 
Flathead County held its largest mail-in election ever, and ended up rejecting 663 total ballots, or 2.06%. The ballots rejected due to the birth year was 384. 
After voters had the chance to resolve their ballot issues, the county ended up with a rejection rate of 1.23%. That’s close to double what was seen during the 2024 election, though the county election administrator noted that such a large turnout in a presidential year makes it an inexact comparison. 
In Cascade County, elections were held for the cities of Great Falls and Belt. 
In Great Falls, 166 ballots were missing a year of birth or incorrectly filled out the year of birth out of 309 total rejected ballots for a roughly 1.9% rejection rate. 
The town of Belt saw 28 votes cast for alderman, and three ballots rejected for a missing birth year. 
Cascade County elections specialist Heather Potter said that rejection rates were higher than normal, with data showing that previous years’ rejected ballot numbers were matched by this year’s birth year rejections alone. 
In Ravalli County,the new law showed a limited impact on voters. 
County election administrator Regina Plettenberg said that there were only 17 rejected ballots across three municipal elections, “no more than usual.”
“We didn’t do a lot of outreach before the election, but we did put a very simple notice in with the ballot and it was separate from the regular instructions,” Plettenberg said. “Of course this was a much smaller election in Ravalli County than in some other counties.”
The new law, carried in the Legislature by Columbia Falls Rep. Braxton Mitchell, a Republican, was intended to enhance election security by adding a second identification point for voters to provide in addition to a signature that must be matched to county records. 
During the session, Mitchell said that the law is a “common-sense practice,” that aligns absentee voting with in-person requirements.
Montana has had just two known cases of election fraud since 1997, according to the Heritage Foundation’s election fraud tracker. 
The Secretary of State’s office, in a press release, said the recent election was the first “during Secretary (Christi) Jacobsen’s two terms in which no voter had reported a violation of someone else voting on their behalf.”
However, the office did not provide any details about previous cases of fraud during Jacobsen’s previous term.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/montana-election-day-2024-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 20:58:28.231463

AnderBois’ event at Providence’s Wild Colonial Tavern began about 20 minutes after its scheduled start time, because she was talking to people as they began pouring into the tavern around 6 p.m. AnderBois continued that thread of goodwill in her remarks, referring to those gathered as her “friends.”
“Friends, I don’t want to be cheesy,” AnderBois said, “We need leadership that not only has a bold vision, but also a real love for the nitty gritty details of getting things done and for the people who do it. We know that some of the best work comes from love and collaboration, not from fear and intimidation.”
Several dozen supporters gathered in the dark, stone-walled pub at the outer edge of Providence’s East Side to support AnderBois, who represents Ward 3 on the capital city’s council, which includes the neighborhoods of Mount Hope, Hope Village, Collyer Park, and Blackstone. 
Joining her at the podium were fellow City Councilor Justin Roias and state Rep. Megan Cotter of Exeter, who are both Democrats. 
“When I was first elected to the Providence City Council, I didn’t know Sue,” Roias said. “But I quickly got to know her well, mostly because she sat right next to me in the council chambers.”
“When one of our colleagues would say something — let’s just call it ‘unexpected’ — Sue and I mastered the art of nonverbal communication,” Roias continued, his comments drawing laughter from the crowd. “We would just exchange that look, the one that says, ‘What on earth did that person just say?’”
Roias said he has got to know AnderBois “beyond those shared side-eye moments,” and that his fellow councilor has taught him “something profound about…government.”
“She has a way of moving through this world, both practical and principled,” Roias said. “And to be honest, I’ve always wrestled with that tension.”
AnderBois was first elected to her City Council seat in November 2022, trouncing rival Michael Fink, an Independent, with nearly 87% of the vote. 
So far in her tenure representing Ward 3, AnderBois has led ordinances to ban gas-powered leaf blowers in the city and steered $5 million in federal and state funds toward safety improvements and repairs along North Main Street. She also led eco-friendly initiatives such as an ordinance that mandates select large buildings to report their energy usage, and a municipal law that strives for carbon-neutrality in all city-owned buildings by 2040. 
AnderBois currently serves as the Council’s deputy majority whip, and she chairs the North Main Street Task Force and Special Committee on Environment & Resiliency. Her day job is director of climate and energy in the northeast division of The Nature Conservancy, a global nonprofit.
“My mom likes to joke that I was born with a to-do list in my hand,” AnderBois told her supporters.

The Rhode Island Constitution prescribes that the Lieutenant Governor replace the governor if they should “die, remove from the state, refuse to serve; become insane, or be otherwise incapacitated.” This has happened only seven times since the Constitution’s ratification in 1842, according to 2021 analysis in the Boston Globe. 
The most recent lieutenant governor to seize the highest office is current Gov. Dan McKee, who took over for Gina Raimondo when she left to work under former president Joe Biden as commerce secretary. Before McKee, the last time a lieutenant governor assumed a vacant governor’s office was in 1951, when John S. McKiernan served for two weeks, after Gov. John Pastore left office early when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
State general laws afford Rhode Island’s lieutenant governor some additional duties, such as chairing the Long-Term Care Coordinating Council, the Emergency Management Advisory Committee, and the Small Business Advocacy Council.
Roias acknowledged that the lieutenant governorship is not the flashiest state office, and he said it’s “notoriously seen as a lame duck position.” 
“But it doesn’t have to be in the right hands,” Roias said. “It can be a platform, a space, to push forward bold ideas, to challenge complacency and to make government actually work for people, and I believe Sue can do exactly that.”
The base salary for the job was $137,510 in the budgets for both fiscal year 2025 and 2026.
The lieutenant governor often gets involved in legislative advocacy as well. Current Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, for instance, has made fairer grocery prices a cornerstone of her legislative agenda since she was nominated by McKee and appointed by the Rhode Island Senate in 2021. Matos resigned from her role as president of the Providence City Council when she assumed the post of lieutenant governor. She held onto the position in the 2022 election.
No independent or Republican candidates have announced their candidacy as of Wednesday.
As of the latest filing on Sept. 30, Coyne’s campaign account trumped that of both her peers, with $69,457. Matos had $45,191 and AnderBois had $24,868.   
The primary will take place on Sept. 8, 2026, followed by the general election on Nov. 3, 2026.

(Photo by Bryan Whitten/UAF Geophysical Institute)A series of solar flares, essentially explosions on the surface of the sun, caused unusually bright and colorful displays of aurora borealis in Alaska and other northern latitudes on Tuesday night.
University of Alaska Fairbanks Physics Professor Mark Conde said he and other researchers expect that atmospheric activity will continue to result in vividly colored displays of aurora, or northern lights, through Wednesday night. He described seeing large, tall swaths of red in the night sky from his home in Fairbanks.
“It was like seeing the fine wine of the aurora,” Conde said. “Deep red aurora is quite unusual, and they only really occur during extreme events like this.”
Aurora borealis is caused by charged particles, mainly protons and electrons, that stream into the Earth’s magnetic field and strike our atmosphere. The reaction essentially paints a picture on the atmosphere that is visible in the night sky.
Recent explosions on the surface of the sun have resulted in highly visible displays of northern lights because those solar flares caused more charged particles to come into contact with the Earth’s atmosphere.

Conde said that as solar winds stream by our atmosphere, they generate electric fields. The Earth’s magnetic field generally deflects particles away from the near-Earth region, but if the solar wind has an opposite magnetic charge, then it can penetrate into the protective bubble of the Earth’s magnetic field, and eventually find its way down to our atmosphere. He said that results in highly visible auroras like what was observable in many parts of the northern hemisphere last night.
“It’s almost like a switch,” he said of the favorably aligned magnetic fields. “(The solar wind) can open the switch and let itself in. And that’s kind of what happened last night, when (the cloud of materials from the solar flare) first hit the magnetic field it was extremely favorable to allow the solar wind to penetrate into the near-Earth environment and pump up the magnetosphere and produce the displays that we saw.”
He said the unusual deep red color of the displays was caused by a large flow of low energy particles that were able to interact with the Earth’s atmosphere.
Many people are drawn to the spectacular visuals of the aurora, but Conde said scientists study it for a more practical reason: The aurora is one aspect of space weather, which has significant effects on modern technology, including satellites and radio communication. 
Conde said he and his colleagues have not yet heard of any big disruptions from this week’s solar flares, but they did disrupt data collection on two spacecraft that university researchers use to monitor the solar wind. He said in past years, solar winds have knocked Starlink internet communication satellites out of orbit, causing them to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere.

The solar flares that are causing such vivid auroras this week can also accelerate radiation that can be harmful to astronauts and spacecraft, Conde said.
“If there was an astronaut standing on the surface of the Moon last night — outside the magnetic, protective bubble of the earth — or en route to Mars, they wouldn’t have been killed, I don’t think, by the radiation, but there would have been enough radiation that they would have had significant health risks,” he said.
Another practical reason for a physicist such as Conde to observe the aurora is that the near-Earth environment is regarded by scientists as a natural laboratory.
“We can look at plasma phenomena occurring in space that we can’t possibly reproduce on Earth because… if you wanted to study those plasma interactions on the ground, you would need a vacuum chamber that would be 100 kilometers in diameter or something,” he said.
He said observations of how Earth interacts with solar wind and the near-Earth environment can help answer questions about the long term evolution of our upper atmosphere. 
“Plus,” he said, “It’s pretty!”

Following the recent resignation of Northfield’s police chief, the town was looking to neighboring Berlin to provide police service in the interim. But Berlin Police Chief James Pontbriand said this week he has no intention of filling the gap without some compensation.
Given how “murky” things are at the Northfield Police Department, “we really don’t want to be a part of that ongoing drama at all,” Pontbriand said at Monday’s selectboard meeting, referring to the town’s struggles maintaining police staff.
Pontbriand, who has served as Berlin’s police chief for more than five years, told VTDigger on Wednesday that Vermont can be a difficult place for out-of-state officers.

The certification process can be “challenging,” and there is no onboarding process for new chiefs who come from other states, he said. Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez faced “a lot of challenges” from the get go, he said.
Gomez, 58, resigned at the end of October. He was hired in September 2023 in the Washington County town after former chief John Helfant retired amid controversy.
One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont, Gomez reported facing racial harassment since he moved to town two years ago from Pennsylvania. He further alleged the town, particularly the town manager, did not adequately respond to support him nor deal with the people casting doubt on his work.
Gomez, a Black Latino man, submitted a letter of complaint to the town on April 16. In June, the town paid a private firm $17,000, authorizing a third-party investigation to evaluate ethics violations, according to Northfield Selectboard Chair Charlie Morse. No action has been taken, and none of the findings have been made public. “Ethics complaints are confidential,” Morse said at the time.
Further, the board voted unanimously on Sept. 9 to instruct Town Manager Jeff Schulz and Gomez to meet weekly. Morse said the board “discovered a departure of policy” and felt a standing meeting would help “an overall continuous improvement process in performance management for both leaders.”
In response to VTDigger public records requests, Michael Leddy of McNeil, Leddy & Sheahan claimed in a Sept. 23 letter that documents pertaining to the letter and the investigations are “completely exempt” from being shared, citing several exemptions under state law. The Burlington law firm serves as legal counsel to the town, according to Leddy.
‘A lot of challenges’
When Gomez resigned in September, Pontbriand said they had “spoken frequently” about the problems Gomez faced in town and he was sorry to see him go.
“The Northfield Police Department has been struggling for years and the Chief certainly had an uphill battle from the start,” he wrote in an email to VTDigger last month.
“I think there were a lot of challenges already in place facing him as far as personnel goes and just some of the politics of the town,” Pontbriand said Wednesday. “I don’t want to speak negatively of the governance, but he did share a lot of his frustration trying to make things happen there.”
Pontbriand, who developed a friendship with Gomez, said he found him “knowledgeable and capable, certainly very vocal about the things that he needed.”
Pontbriand also said he is frustrated at the way things are playing out regarding the police assistance Berlin provides, as discussed by the selectboard this week, particularly the lack of communication from Northfield.
“I originally approached the town manager down there, probably at the time that Pierre gave his notice, to propose that, Hey, we’re not going to continue to do this for free,” he said.
An unsigned draft of the Northfield-Berlin intermunicipal police agreement was on Monday’s selectboard meeting agenda. But Pontbriand said he was never contacted by Northfield officials and was concerned “people were under the impression that we were going to take over police services.”
“I myself didn’t see this document until the other night, which caused some confusion within my own agency that we’re completely taking over police services, which we are not,” he said at the meeting, adding that the Berlin selectboard had not seen the memo either.
“There is no signed police coverage agreement and there has never been,” Pontbriand said Wednesday.
Police staffing issues 
In the past, Berlin police responded as a courtesy when Vermont State Police were unavailable to provide backup to Northfield. State Police has faced severe staffing shortages in recent years, curtailing its ability to assist local police departments. State Police were not immediately available for comment.
The Washington County town of Northfield, with a population of about 6,000, has a small police department consisting of a chief and one full-time officer. It has an estimated annual budget of almost $35,000, according to the town. 
About 14 miles north, Berlin has a larger police force consisting of a chief and nine officers serving a population of about 2,500 and a commercial corridor, according to Pontbriand, who said Monday he expects Northfield will lean more heavily on Berlin for police response in the absence of a police chief. 
“I wanted to make sure that we receive some benefit for applying the service,” he said at Monday’s meeting. “We would only come if State Police are not available. I just want to make that clear. So we’d be the third in line: Northfield, State Police, and then us if no one else is available.”
Pontbriand estimated Berlin police respond to Northfield calls about twice a month. After Gomez’s departure, for example, a Berlin police officer responded to an early morning fire that involved a person trapped inside the residence and a person with a weapon threatening first responders outside, Pontbriand said, resulting in three hours of overtime. But Berlin has never received compensation for police coverage in the past. 
“We’d be willing to assist … on a case by case basis,” Pontbriand said. “There will be a cost associated with that, but I don’t expect it to be a frequent thing.” 
Northfield has a smaller police department with limited capabilities. It currently has a Level 2 officer on staff — Sgt. Brian Gosselin — who is limited in scope on what he can respond to. A Level 2 certified officer cannot, for instance, investigate felonies or conduct death investigations, according to Pontbriand.
Certified Level 2 officers have a minimum of 30 hours of training per year, while certified Level 3 officers have more intensive training, per state requirements. Gomez was certified Level 3.
Northfield residents have voiced concerns at recent meetings about inadequate police coverage given the department’s current staffing woes, particularly since Gomez left. Gosselin said Monday he has a backlog of cases and needs help.
Pontbriand said the town needs to install “an experienced law enforcement officer” to supervise the police department in the interim. While Gosselin is “very capable,” Pontbriand said he is limited by state statutes.
Gomez, who virtually attended Monday’s meeting, said Gosselin has the training to be a good interim until the town can hire a new police chief, and suggested that the town listen and support him. Gomez said he discussed the police coverage agreement a month ago and asked the town manager for answers.
The selectboard discussed potentially formalizing the service Berlin provides and providing some compensation to the neighboring police department, as suggested by the chief. Gosselin suggested paying Berlin for the felony-type cases he cannot cover.
“They have a lot of questions, which is fine and understandable,” Pontbriand said.
The board also discussed advertising the police chief position. Gosselin recommended reaching out to veteran officers with good experience, good reputation and clean records who are interested in leadership positions and building up a police department.Schulz, the Northfield town manager who is set to retire next year, did not respond this week to queries about the process and timeline for filling the vacant police chief spot, nor whether the town has received any applications or letters of interest. 
“I do not know if the manager has received letters of interest from any one,” Morse said in an email Tuesday.
However, Morse confirmed former police chief Helfant, who earlier this year surrendered his law enforcement certification, has recommended the town hire Norwich Police Chief Matthew Romei, who was formerly the Capitol Police chief.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., doubled down while speaking to reporters in Columbia Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, on a long-shot proposal to halt congressional pay in the case of any future government shutdown. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — As a restart of the federal government appears imminent, Sen. Lindsey Graham is doubling down on a long-shot proposal to change the Constitution to halt congressional pay in any future shutdown.
The South Carolina Republican introduced the constitutional amendment two weeks ago that would force members of Congress to forfeit their paychecks entirely, automatically sending their pay to the Treasury if lawmakers again fail to keep the government funded.
“If I never do anything else in this job, I’m gonna push the hell out of this,” Graham said while speaking to reporters in Columbia Wednesday.
The shutdown that began Oct. 1 became the longest in United States history as senators failed 14 times to reach the required 60-vote threshold needed to clear the way for approval of a stopgap funding agreement. A 15th vote succeeded late Sunday after Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in voting to advance the legislation. Expected approval by the U.S. House could reopen the government as early as Thursday.
Under federal law, the president, Congress and federal judges all receive regular paychecks when the government shuts down due to lack of funding. But unlike the lawmakers that allowed it to happen, the country’s 2 million civilian government employees and thousands of congressional staffers go without pay until the government reopens.
SC congressional delegation donating, pausing paychecks amid government shutdown

Members of Congress have the choice to receive their pay as normal, donate it to charity, give the money back to the Treasury to buy down the federal debt, or have their checks withheld. Those who opt to withhold get backpay when the shutdown ends, similar to other federal workers.
Graham opted to donate the $20,700 he received over the last month and a half to Upstate Warrior Solutions. He cut the check to the Greenville-based veterans charity on Tuesday, he said.
South Carolina’s senior senator voted consistently over the 43-day shutdown to reopen the government. But he acknowledged that Republicans caused a 35-day shutdown in late December 2018 through mid-January 2019 in a push for money to build a wall along the country’s southern border.
“But what I’ve learned from this experience, if you’ve got a policy debate, don’t shut down the government to get an outcome,” he said. “That’s not a good way to legislate.”
The Constitution prevents Congress from changing its own pay rules. Lawmakers can only make changes that impact future congressional sessions. So, a constitutional amendment would be the best option, Graham argued.
In the U.S. House, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina’s 5th District has introduced a similar measure. The Rock Hill Republican has said he will also donate his pay during the shutdown.
The measure stands little chance of success. The amendment process requires two-thirds majority approval in each chamber, then approval by three-fourths of the states for ratification.
Still, Graham hasn’t backed down.
“I’m going to push that as hard as I know how to push it,” he said. “And I do believe if we had to give our pay up, there’d be less shutdowns.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3635-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 19:57:04.524352

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Regents wasn’t ready to call for any hard and fast decisions when it came to potential tuition guarantee programs Wednesday, having received a report on how they’ve worked at other institutions and potential impacts on Iowa universities.
A tuition guarantee program locks in a student’s tuition their first year, ensuring the cost won’t increase as they continue through their undergraduate education.
Board Chief Business Officer Brad Berg worked with Regent Christine Hensley and former Regent David Barker to develop a report on tuition guarantee programs. The Iowa Legislature passed legislation this year requiring study of the topic and the board this spring assigned the group to conduct the work.
“Implementation of a tuition guarantee program would require careful system planning and testing and establishment of clear policies and ongoing coordination and communication with students and families,” Berg said.

When combining sources of income for Iowa’s public universities, Berg said the breakdown falls at 20% resident undergraduate tuition, 30% state appropriations and the rest coming from tuition from other groups, such as nonresident and graduate students.
Traditionally, when state funding decreases, tuition then increases, and Berg said tax reductions from the state could lead to funding uncertainty in the future. The report also stated that federal actions have caused even more uncertainty in areas of research and student financial aid.
“Given the historical variability in Iowa’s higher education funding, implementing a tuition guarantee policy without a stable funding base could lead to unintended consequences, potentially limiting the ability of the state’s public universities to adapt to fluctuations in state support, inflation and rising operational costs,” the report stated.
Berg said there are also technical considerations when considering implementing a tuition guarantee, like whether software would need to be replaced and certain programs changed. Each of the universities uses a different system for tuition payments and houses academic programs with unique tuition costs, and students often change their majors or make other moves that impact their bills.
The study group examined tuition guarantee programs across the U.S. for the report, including Drake University in Des Moines. Results were mixed on their success, Berg said, with some discontinuing their programs due to budget shortfalls after economic downturns caused state funding to decrease. Others, including Drake, continue to operate their programs without negative impacts.
Cameron University in Oklahoma offers an optional tuition guarantee program that has students paying a premium their first year to keep tuition set for the rest of their college career, with a traditional tuition payment plan still available. Berg said enrollment in the optional program is “very low.”
“An optional program such as this would need to be carefully designed and tested to avoid unintended consequences,” Berg said.
Regent Kurt Tjaden expressed concerns that a tuition guarantee would eventually lead to cutting costs in other areas, and the area with the most costs is in staffing.
“You’re taking that financial lever away, right, because you won’t be able to increase tuition for that class,” Tjaden said. “So said differently, to maintain financial viability the regents institutions are going to have to cut people — because that’s where the costs are — to offset that lost tuition.”
It would depend on the premium rate set by universities, Berg said, if that’s the plan the board decides to move forward with.
He said the study group discussed the optional tuition plan idea and recommended not having students other than undergraduate residents be eligible to participate. The premium that students taking the optional path would pay would also need to be scrutinized annually to change it if necessary.
All the board has to do with the report is receive it and submit it to the General Assembly, according to board documents, but board members still had the future on their minds.
Hensley suggested further study of interest in potential tuition guarantees in partnership with the Iowa College Access Network, an organization she said is in high schools across Iowa answering questions from students about college affordability and financial aid.
While the “primary benefit of a tuition guarantee program is to provide predictability for students and families,” Berg said a policy approved by the board in April makes tuition increases, or their limit, predictable as well.
The policy requires that base undergraduate tuition increases at state universities don’t go over the three-year inflation average set by the Higher Education Price Index. Berg said Iowa’s universities have hiked tuition by an average of 3.2% over the past five years.
Berg suggested, and Bates and other members of the board agreed, that waiting to see how the increase cap impacts institutions and students would be the best option before implementing any new strategies based on the tuition guarantee report.
“It would be beneficial for me to see the policies that we recently put in place work,” Berg said.

The Wyoming Attorney General’s office is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit against several former and current officials at the women’s prison in Lusk for their role in hiring and employing a guard who was later convicted of sexually assaulting an inmate in 2023.  The state contends that the lawsuit does not make […]
The post Wyoming Attorney Gene[...]","The Wyoming Attorney General’s office is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit against several former and current officials at the women’s prison in Lusk for their role in hiring and employing a guard who was later convicted of sexually assaulting an inmate in 2023. 
The state contends that the lawsuit does not make a plausible claim and was filed outside the statute of limitations. The motion to dismiss, filed Saturday, also argues that Wyoming’s U.S. District Court does not have jurisdiction in the case. 
“Consequently, the State Defendants should be dismissed from this action,” the motion states. 
Since 2020, three former prison guards at the Wyoming Women’s Center have been convicted of sexually assaulting female inmates. One of those women, Chasity Jacobs, filed a federal lawsuit in August that argued the sexual abuse violated her constitutional rights. 
The lawsuit also makes a claim under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act for what the plaintiff described as negligence by the prison’s Warden Timothy Lang and Associate Warden Robert Harty. 
“The pervasive problem of sexual assault by WWC correctional officers was well known to prison administrators including, specifically, Defendants Lang and Hardy,” the lawsuit argues. “Despite this, Defendant Lang, and other supervisory personnel failed to implement safeguards or address the systemic breakdowns in hiring, training, reporting, or accountability that enabled repeated sexual abuse.” 
Before he was hired to work at the women’s prison in 2019, Joseph Gaul was fired from at least two public-sector jobs in Nebraska due to misconduct toward women, according to the lawsuit.

In 2023, he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault against the plaintiff. He was later sentenced to two to five years in prison and is eligible for parole in October, according to the Wyoming Department of Corrections. 
In a Sept. 30 response to the complaint, Gaul, 46, wrote that he had not yet secured an attorney for the case. The Wyoming Attorney General is representing Warden Lang and Associate Warden Harty.
Motion to dismiss
In its motion, the Wyoming Attorney General’s office claims that the U.S. Constitution’s 11th Amendment — which prohibits federal courts from hearing lawsuits against a state filed by citizens of another state or a foreign country — provides the state with immunity in this instance. 
More specifically, it bars federal court jurisdiction over a state agency, in this case the women’s prison, for both money damages and injunctive relief, the state argues. 
In the lawsuit, Jacobs makes claims under a federal statute known as Section 1983, which allows individuals to sue state and local government officials for depriving them of their constitutional or federal rights while acting “under color of state law.” 
The prison warden and deputy warden, however, “are not ‘persons’ subject” to Section 1983, the attorney general’s motion argues. 
Furthermore, the state alleges, the lawsuit does not establish that Lang or Harty acted in a deliberate, intentional way to violate the plaintiff’s legal rights. In other words, it is not enough that either Lang or Harty acted in a supervisory role when Gaul violated the plaintiff’s constitutional rights. 
“Jacobs manages to refer to a specific act… the hiring of Gaul… but she does not allege that the State Defendants actually did the hiring,” the motion states. 
“Jacobs also does not allege that the State Defendants knew anything about Gaul’s alleged history, and thus she does not begin to allege they had a culpable state of mind (deliberate indifference).” 
The state also accuses the plaintiff of filing a Wyoming Governmental Claims Act claim outside the two years allowed under the statute of limitations. 
“The latest sexual assault alleged by Jacobs in this case occurred on July 24, 2023,” the motion states. “Jacobs had until July 24, 2025 to file a notice of claim under the WGCA.”
And because Lang and Harty are state employees, “Jacobs was required to file the notice of claim with ‘the general services division of the department of administration and information,” the state’s motion claims.
When the lawsuit was filed in August, attorneys for Jacobs included an exhibit of a notice of claim to the Wyoming Department of Corrections, the Wyoming Attorney General, Lang and Harty. It is dated July 21, 2025.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Representatives of North Dakota colleges on Wednesday espoused the value of offering online classes, even to students who may never set foot in the state. 
State lawmakers have been trying to assess the value of providing state funding to online programs serving students outside North Dakota and neighboring states. 
“We are still highly subsidizing,” Sen. Ron Sorvaag, R-Fargo, chair of the Higher Education Funding Review Committee said of online classes. “We still need to understand, are we getting a bang for the buck?” 
A University System presentation said the state is spending about $22 million on online courses for out-of-state students for the most recent two-year budget cycle. That doesn’t include online students from Minnesota, Montana or South Dakota.

Sorvaag said legislators aren’t opposed to online education, but want to make sure the dollars that go to online courses through the state’s higher education funding formula are being used wisely. 
The committee will consider possible changes to the funding formula that could be made in the 2027 legislative session. 
Much of the discussion centered on out-of-state, online students. In 2021-23, the University System had nearly 9,000 out-of-state, online students who were not residents of neighboring states, according to figures presented to the committee. Total enrollment for those two years was more than 77,000 students.
Karla Mongeon-Stewart, vice president of finance for the University of North Dakota, addressed value by saying that UND students in that category contribute $2.09 in tuition and fees for every $1 of state funding. 
She said online students pay the same fees as on-campus students that help maintain buildings, pay down debt and keep fees for things such as recreation facilities low for on-campus students.
She said revenue from online students has helped keep UND financially stable at times when on-campus enrollment has waned. 
Mongeon-Stewart also highlighted how UND has built a reputation as a credible online institution that reflects positively on the whole state. She gave examples of Sara Sabry, an Egyptian astronaut, and Paige Jones, an Olympic-level skier from Utah, who chose to take classes from UND. 
She said UND also serves the military community and the two Air Force bases in the state. People living at a base may start their education in North Dakota but end up being deployed or transferred to another state. 
UND and Bismarck State College lead the North Dakota University System in online credit hours. 
UND’s most popular courses are nursing and engineering. Mongeon-Stewart said the additional enrollment from online students helps diversify the engineering course offerings the university can offer. 
Bismarck State’s most popular classes are related to the energy industry. 
Dan Leingang, interim president of Bismarck State College, said some of those students may not be seeking a degree but needing training to succeed with their current employer. 
His written testimony included letters of support from Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, and Jonathan Fortner, president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council. 
In other higher education meetings this fall, lawmakers have shown frustration with a lack of data on where out-of-state online students are living. 
Enrollment up nearly 4% at North Dakota public colleges, universities

Mongeon-Stewart said there has not been consistency in how North Dakota’s 11 public colleges and universities track out-of-state online students, but the institutions are working on a uniform model. 
She said she hopes it will include information such as a North Dakota affiliation, like being a graduate from a high school or college in the state. 
“We are going to work really hard to do a better job in the future of giving you what you need,” she told lawmakers. 
Sorvaag said he was grateful for the presentations on out-of-state online students, but added that the Legislature must still decide if subsidizing those courses is the best use of state money. Lawmakers could decide state dollars are better spent in other areas, such as supporting scholarships for in-state students, he said. 
The question is part of a larger potential overhaul of the state’s funding formula for higher education. 
“The more we dig into this, the more we understand how complicated this is,” Sorvaag said.

(Juan Salinas II /Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is trying to repeat in a competition that saves more lives than sports.
A year after nearly 4,000 donors gave blood in UNL’s name, which nearly doubled the next closest competitor, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin narrowly leads Nebraska in the 2025 version of the blood feud. Nebraska is behind Wisconsin by about 100 donors.

UNL won $1 million in the inaugural competition last year for student or community health. The school is seeking a similar prize this year.
Nebraska volleyball player Andi Jackson, a junior middle blocker on the nation’s top-ranked team, urged Husker fans to step up again for a good cause. She said she had donated blood in the past and hopes the community will pitch in. 
“I didn’t realize the significance that your donation has and the impact that it can have,” Jackson said. 
 Jackson said giving blood “can save up to three lives [and] it can just give someone a little bit more time or save their life.” 
The past few years have seen a shortage of blood supply since the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Red Cross declared an emergency blood shortage in 2024. The university is planning three large campus blood drives this week. Two are at the Newman Center Wednesday and Thursday.  Another is happening at Memorial Stadium Friday.
The university is entering people who give blood Friday at Memorial Stadium into a raffle for tickets to the Nebraska-Iowa volleyball match. 
The school that wins the blood drive competition will be announced at the Big Ten Football Championship game Dec. 6 in Indianapolis.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A state panel on Wednesday approved raises for future statewide elected officials totaling more than $500,000.
The Statewide Official Compensation Commission voted to increase the pay of statewide elected officials by at least 25%. Only the governor is slated to receive a smaller increase. The next governor will see a 5.4% pay increase, boosting that position’s pay from $147,000 to $155,000. Taxpayers provide the governor with a home and transportation.
The same board, which met for the first time since lawmakers created it, voted to more than double the state superintendent’s salary from $124,373 to $250,000.
Supporters of the hike argued that statewide officials’ salaries hadn’t been increased since 2009.
“The fact that they have not had a salary increase since 2009 – I’m embarrassed,” said David “Chip” Carter, a member of the commission.
The new salaries won’t go into effect until after the November 2026 election. State law prohibits elected officials from receiving a salary increase during their term in office.
Previously, lawmakers set the salary of statewide elected officials or tied them to judicial salaries, but they delegated the task to the newly created panel.
Carter said the new salaries should attract the best and brightest to the roles. He said some officials must give up earning potential to serve the state.
“I’m not embarrassed,” said Jeff Baumann, a member. “I didn’t set them. Those people all knew what they were doing when they took the job.”
Baumann also asked why the board canceled its original meeting set for Nov. 4.
Chairman Brian Jackson said the board didn’t want to vote on pay while recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program had their benefits put on hold due to the governmental shutdown, which began Oct. 1. Over 680,000 Oklahomans receive food stamps. The U.S. Department of Agriculture authorized the state to begin issuing partial payments earlier this week.
The lieutenant governor’s salary will rise to $145,000 from $114,713, a 26% increase.
A motion to raise it to $120,713 failed. The lieutenant governor is provided transportation.
The next attorney general will be paid $185,000, up from $132,825, a 39% increase.
Matt Tilly, a member and attorney, argued the increase is necessary because new attorneys at larger law firms make over $100,000 a year.
Other elected positions that saw salary increases include:

The three members of the Corporation Commission. They will each make $165,000, a nearly 44% increase from $114,713.
The state treasurer. The board increased that official’s pay by nearly 53%. It will increase to $175,000 from $114,713.
State auditor and inspector. That post will earn $150,000, up from $114,713, a nearly 31% hike.
Insurance commissioner. The commissioner will earn $185,000, up from $126,713, a 46% hike.
Labor commissioner. Pay for that role will rise to $135,000 from $105,053, a nearly 29% increase.

A motion to increase all the salaries by only 5% across the board failed to advance.

Trump is expected to sign it into law as early as Wednesday night. The enactment of the bill — and the subsequent renewal of federal payments — would resolve a dizzying weekslong saga over SNAP that placed the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who use the program in the middle of a political and legal battle playing out across every level of the federal judiciary. Since the shutdown began Oct. 1, the USDA has reversed its own position, the U.S. Supreme Court paused lower court orders and Trump himself expressed contradicting views.In the most recent chapter, USDA said it would authorize states to pay 65% of benefits for November, and the Supreme Court paused until Thursday night lower court orders compelling full payments. The department had previously told a Rhode Island federal court it could take weeks or even months for beneficiaries to receive the partial allotments and the administration continued to fight rulings to immediately release full funding, even as the shutdown crept toward its conclusion.",,,,2025-11-12 18:57:08.730459

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Millions of gallons of oily water and spilled petrochemicals from the Smitty’s Supply fire and explosion have been handled at three different sites, but state officials have granted an emergency request to bring some of the liquid and solid waste to a Jefferson Parish landfill.  
River Birch LLC, which operates a landfill in Avondale, received a permit exemption last month from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to accept waste recovered after the Aug. 22 fire disaster in Tangipahoa Parish, according to LDEQ records the agency published this week.
Although River Birch’s Class 1 injection wells are permitted for only non-hazardous materials, a 1996 federal law allows them to be used to dispose of certain hazardous materials mixed when with water. River Birch uses its injection wells for petrochemical wastewater, industrial sludge, oily waters, solvents, acids, contaminated groundwater and stormwater, and other liquid wastes that would otherwise be considered hazardous, according to the company’s website.
River Birch’s injection well permit allows it to accept liquid waste statewide, but its solid waste permit is limited to a 13-parish area that doesn’t include Tangipahoa. The company requested the emergency solid waste exception on Oct. 13, and the state approved it two days later. 
“This is a unique opportunity for Smitty’s to manage all of its contaminated waste at a properly permitted facility,” Chris Casteix, River Birch’s environmental compliance manager, wrote in the company’s emergency request to the agency.

In its approval letter to River Birch, the Department of Environmental Quality said the waste from Smitty’s Supply “will have no significant adverse impact on the public health, safety, welfare, and the environment.”
It’s unclear how much waste Smitty’s Supply will send to the River Birch landfill. Neither company has responded to calls or emails. 
More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28. Roughly half of that amount has already been disposed of at other facilities, according to information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state. 
As of Oct. 16, EPA contractors brought 2.7 million gallons of recovered waste to Preston Environmental Solutions in Baton Rouge for recycling and 3.7 million gallons to Woodside Landfill in Livingston Parish for solidification. 
Another 595,000 gallons has been taken to a landfill in Liberty, Mississippi, and injected underground, according to LDEQ records.
Underground injection of liquid waste is an accepted disposal practice under state and federal laws. 
Whether it’s an injection well for waste disposal or an oil well for extraction, the structure is mostly the same. A hole is drilled to a desired depth, typically around 4,000 feet for Class 1 wells, and supported with long sections of pipe cemented in place to prevent cave-ins. Often an additional layer of tubing lines the inner walls of the pipe to prevent leaks. There is no encasement or container at the bottom of the well. The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground. 
As of Sept. 30, 2025, petrochemicals still filled ponds near the Tangipahoa River across the street from the destroyed Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland nearly six weeks after itcaught fire and exploded. (Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)
The EPA requires a Class 1 well to extend below the lowermost formations containing drinking water within a quarter-mile vicinity. Patrick Courreges, spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, said there must be a good enough barrier of impervious rock to prevent any of the waste from seeping upwards. 
 River Birch’s website says its wells are positioned 6,500 feet underground.   
Injection wells are generally the cheapest option to dispose of contaminated liquid waste, but they do carry some risks such as well leaks and groundwater contamination, according to the EPA and other sources. The federal agency says underground injection is safe when the wells are placed at an appropriate site and properly maintained.
As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday. 
“River Birch will be disposing of non-hazardous solid waste that they are already permitted to dispose of,” LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply. She wants to know who determines whether the waste going to River Birch is hazardous or not and if any kind of testing is required to make that determination. 
“Even if it’s technically OK, should the parish take in waste from Smitty’s?” Karlin said. “Everything I’ve seen suggests that the Smitty’s waste is likely highly toxic.”
Members of the Jefferson Parish Council have not responded to her questions about River Birch’s permit, she said. 
Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng and Councilmembers at-large Jennifer Van Vrancken and Scott Walker have not responded to a reporter’s request for comment.
Karlin also questioned whether River Birch’s permit exemption warranted expedited approval when waste from Tangipahoa Parish was already going to other landfills that were closer in distance.
“Why drive over an hour to get to River Birch?” Karlin asked.  
The 180-day emergency permit exemption will remain in effect until mid-April.
Smitty’s Supply faces a lawsuit from the state and EPA that seeks fines and penalties that could exceed a billion dollars for years of environmental violations. The Louisiana Environmental Action Network has also given notice that it intends to sue the company over violations of the federal Clean Water Act.

(Screenshot from livestream)As the Capitol building buzzed with news of a long-awaited budget deal on Wednesday, two dozen House lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee debated the wording of bills on post-conviction relief for certain veterans and restitution for juvenile offenders.
Several measures on the lengthy agenda passed unanimously, but some Republicans had concerns that imprecise language could have unintended consequences. 
“Many of these are just not ready for prime time today,” summarized Franklin’s Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Franklin), the minority committee chair. 
House Bill 458, sponsored by Rep. Carol Hill-Evans (D-York), sought to expand an existing allowance made for veterans in the criminal justice systems with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries. 
State law allows veterans to submit either diagnosis as a mitigating factor during sentencing, but not as part of a post-conviction review — leaving out those who are diagnosed while incarcerated. 
 
Veteran defendants made up 5.6% of all criminal dockets in Pennsylvania between 2016 and 2021 — with rural counties having disproportionately higher numbers of veteran defendants.


“These are men and women who served our country honorably, and it’s not uncommon for their trauma to go unrecognized or untreated for months or even years,” said Hill-Evans. 
“Those invisible wounds of war may have contributed to the circumstances that led to their incarceration. Justice demands that we take that into account,” she added.
A December memo accompanying the bill notes that any veteran diagnosed prior to 1980, when PTSD was first recognized as a mental illness, couldn’t use their diagnosis as a factor during their sentencing. 
“This bill does not guarantee anyone a reduced sentence; it simply gives the courts the opportunity to review the full picture,” said Hill-Evans. 
But Republicans questioned whether its wording might cover other mental health disorders.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I am concerned that the broad nature of this bill technically allows for the defense of just mental distress or disability,” said Rep. Timothy Bonner (R-Mercer). “I would support the bill if it were limited.” 
Three of the 12 GOP committee members joined the 14 Democrats in support of the proposal. It passed on a 17-9 vote.
The panel unanimously approved House Bill 866, sponsored by Rep. Joe Webster (D-Montgomery), that would require the state Department of Corrections to provide briefings to veterans about whether their veteran benefits might be restored upon release.
 Restitution and the juvenile justice system

A bill seeking to eliminate most fines and fees for juvenile offenders also encountered pushback.
House Bill 1385 sponsor Rep. Emily Kinkead (D-Allegheny)  said such costs kept low-income young people in the justice system longer than their wealthier peers. She said the proposal came at the recommendation of the state’s 2021 Juvenile Justice Task Force. 
Rep. Emily Kinkead (D-Allegheny) introduces a proposal to reduce fines and fees for juvenile offenders. (Screenshot from livestream)
“These are intended for adult offenders and not really contemplating the ability of a juvenile to be able to pay them,” said Kinkead. “In many instances, these kids aren’t actually even able to get jobs.”
Originally, the measure addressed several topics, but a committee amendment stripped that all away — leaving only the portion addressing fees and fines. 
Kauffman questioned the use of the phrase “actual victim” in the bill, an undefined term. Kinkead said she believed that phrase was “a reflection of the bill’s intent to only have restitution imposed in cases where an individual suffers actual material loss.” 
“The idea that (actual victim) was included in the bill makes my skin crawl,” said Kauffman. “A victim is a victim.”
Kauffman also shared a concern that eliminating such costs “prioritizes the offender over the victim” and shifts the focus away from compensating crime victims. 
“Once again, I think this one is not ready for prime time, but needs some additional work,” he noted. 
The bill moved on a 14-12 vote along partisan lines.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-at-2.02.47 PM-1024x571.png,,,2025-11-12 18:57:08.730459

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah state senator on Wednesday officially became the first Democrat to throw her name into the race for the states’ new 1st Congressional District next year under a newly drawn map that was court ordered earlier this week. 
Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, is known to be a fighter on Utah’s Capitol Hill — often a fiery voice on the Senate floor advocating for progressive stances on issues ranging from education to health care. 
Now, she hopes to bring that same fighting voice to Congress in the 2026 midterm elections — a year when she and other Democrats have high hopes of recapturing the majority in the U.S. House. 
Democrats ‘fired up’ for Utah in 2026
Depending on how Democrats fare across the country, the 2026 midterms could shine a unique spotlight on Utah, which for the first time in more than 20 years is on track to have a Democratic-leaning congressional district. The state that has long been reliably red now has the potential of tipping the political scales in the U.S. House for Democrats. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, in a statement earlier this week lauding Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map said “every seat counts, and Democrats everywhere are fired up and ready to take back the House” in 2026. 
“It’s going to totally change the face of Utah at the national level,” Riebe told Utah News Dispatch in an interview, adding that the Beehive State has long been “taken for granted” as a guaranteed Republican stronghold. 
“It’s going to be a big change,” she said. “You know, we have people concerned that we’re a flyover state. And now we won’t be.”
Riebe said she was planning on running for Congress next year regardless of what map 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson picked in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process, but now she’s gearing up to run for District 1 — a district concentrated around northern Salt Lake County. 
Because that district leans heavily Democratic, it’s likely the race will be determined by the Democratic primary. And Riebe isn’t the only one eying the seat. Utah’s last Democratic congressman, former Rep. Ben McAdams, is expected to formally announce his candidacy Thursday. 
Utah Democrats want a ‘strong Democrat,’ Riebe says
Riebe said she’s “not concerned at all” about facing off with McAdams, saying she’s confident that she’s a “strong candidate.”
“I’ve done a lot of hard work for the people of Utah and Salt Lake County,” she said. “(McAdams) has his voting records, and people can start to look at that. I know that something that’s really been brought up to me, frequently, is his support of independents. And Democrats want a Democrat. And they want a strong Democrat. So I feel like that’s going to be the difference between him and I.” 
Utah Democrats likely to win congressional seat in 2026 if judge’s map order stands

McAdams has been known to have more of a moderate and collaborative style. In 2022, he was a leading voice urging his party to forfeit a Democratic nominee and instead back independent candidate Evan McMullin in an effort to unseat Republican Sen. Mike Lee. The party voted to do so — but in the end the effort failed, and McMullin lost. 
Riebe expects the Democratic race for District 1 will be hard fought. “I always anticipate it being a hard race, and I fully anticipate doing everything I can to make sure that I present myself well.”
When McAdams won his congressional election in 2018, it was by narrow margins against the GOP — but now that the newly-drawn District 1 is likely to be reliably Democratic-leaning, Riebe said that changes the dynamics of next year’s race. 
“I think it’s going to give me a lot of strength to stand up for the values of Salt Lake County,” she said. “We’re not like the rest of the state. We have a very urban feel to it. We rely on taking care of a very diverse community. So when you’re running a state race that’s more competitive and you have a bigger field, you have to be a little bit more scattered in your decisions.”
“But for me,” she added, “I’m here to fight for what my county wants now. And I don’t think we’ve had that in a while.” 
Priorities
In her official campaign announcement Wednesday morning, Riebe signaled that affordable health care will be a top priority for her — at a time when Democrats in Congress have tried (so far unsuccessfully) to pressure Republicans to counter skyrocketing health insurance premiums for people in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
“Republicans promised to bring prices down, but instead costs have gone up with Trump’s reckless tariffs, and Republicans have slashed health care — all to give tax breaks to billionaires,” Riebe said in a news release. “That’s why I was so frustrated to see Democrats in Washington take a deal that didn’t do anything to extend the much-needed Affordable Care Act tax subsidies that working families need to help them get by.”
Riebe said it’s “become evident that in order to change what we get out of Washington, we have to change the kind of representatives we send there.” 
“In Congress, I’ll never back down from the fight to lower costs and increase health care affordability,” Riebe said, adding that she also “won’t take a dime” of corporate political action committee money “so I’m only accountable to the people who sent me.”

“I know how to get things accomplished in a divided government, and I’m ready to make Washington work for working families in Utah,” she said. 
Riebe said she’ll do the same as she has on Utah’s Capitol Hill: speak up for the state’s liberal voices who haven’t felt represented by Republicans in power. While she acknowledged in the Utah Senate she doesn’t “get my name on a lot of bills,” she said she makes sure to be the fighting voice to ensure those who disagree with the supermajority GOP get heard. 
“Sometimes you have to be the fighter and the lone vote ‘no’ just to say … there has to be a line in the sand,” she said. “So I’ll fight when I need to and I’ll collaborate when I can.” 
Who is Kathleen Riebe? 
Riebe was first elected to the Utah Senate in 2019. Before her legislative service, she served on the Utah State Board of Education. 
Riebe has a long career in education — having been an educator in Granite School District and more recently a digital teaching and learning coach. She helps train teachers, including in rural areas.
But before her career in education, Riebe said she’s also worked in a lot of other working-class jobs. Aside from being a teacher, she said she’s also worked as a truck driver, waitress, police dispatcher, barista and forestry technician. 
“I’ve had to work really hard … I’m one of the few people that show up to a job every day and get paid to work,” she said. “A lot of people have a lot more financial security than I do — and I think that’s what’s really missing in our government right now. We don’t recognize how hard people are really trying to make ends meet.”

In her current role as an educator, Riebe said she sees people in rural communities who are “really struggling.” 
“I’m in schools. I see families. I understand that they don’t eat sometimes. I see how many free lunches we’re serving. I see kids come to school with medical issues that aren’t being addressed,” Riebe said, adding that it’s “really shocking to me” that those in Washington, D.C. “don’t have a heart for the people that are struggling.” 
Riebe said if she’s elected to represent Utah in Congress, she’ll prioritize fighting for affordable health care while also defending against what she characterized as attacks on the education system, both in Utah and across the nation. 
“I’m also concerned about immigration and how our average citizens are afraid to walk the streets if they are, you know, someone who speaks Spanish,” she said. “You know, calling out the National Guard to fight against the average citizen is just not what I believe America should be.” 
Riebe said she believes she’s the right person to fight for Utah at a time when she “totally” believes Democrats will take back the U.S. House in 2026 to push back against President Donald Trump’s administration. 
“I think people are very, very alarmed at what’s coming out of Washington right now,” she said. “From knocking down the East Wing, to these aggressive executive orders, to taking away congressional benefits that we really have no rights to do… It’s alarming. And it’s really hurting the people that work hard to keep America going.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utahns hoping for clarity on the government’s next move to keep the Colorado River from drying up and still supply plenty of water to the state will have to wait. 
Utah and six other states along the parched river haven’t reached a deal on how they’ll share the water supply a year from now, but they agree enough to keep talking. That progress means they don’t have to turn the job over to the federal government yet, Utah’s negotiator said Wednesday. 
A century-old compact governs use of the river based on flows that have dwindled during decades of overuse, drought and climate change. The river provides 27% of Utah’s water.

“The question is, how do you divide a pie that’s significantly smaller than it has been, when everybody is used to getting that big piece of the pie?” said Gene Shawcroft, Utah’s Colorado River commissioner. 
The federal government set a Nov. 11 deadline for a broad agreement, but gave the states approval to keep talking as they work toward a February cutoff to reach a firm deal, Shawcroft told reporters in a brief conference call. 
He reiterated the states are on the same page about ensuring the river’s “long-term sustainability and resilience.” He did not share specifics on any consensus they’ve reached for how they’ll get there. 
“We have agreed on a number of things that allow us to continue to work together,” Shawcroft said. “The details, we’re still working out.”
In months of negotiations, the upstream states — Utah, Colorado and Wyoming — have stood their ground against a new system that would include mandatory cuts in dry years. Shawcroft indicated they still aren’t budging. 
“In the Upper Basin, mandatory reductions are something that we don’t feel is necessary,” he said.
The Lower Basin states of Nevada, Arizona and California typically use almost all of their allocated water, while the Upper Basin does not. The downstream states have said if cuts aren’t shared across all seven in the new plan, the reductions they face may be too big to absorb. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Shawcroft’s view, negotiators did not miss a deadline because they have enough accord to satisfy the federal government. But seven conservation and recreation groups say they wanted more from Tuesday’s milestone and they’re “deeply disappointed.” 
“Without a clear operating framework, the basin remains exposed to escalating risks — from declining storage in lakes Powell and Mead to deepening uncertainty about how the system will respond to hydrologic extremes,” The Nature Conservancy, National Audubon Society and others said in a joint statement. “Every month without alignment makes it harder to stabilize the river and protect the people, economies, and ecosystems that depend on it.”

The groups called on the US. Department of the Interior and its Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees water in the West and is working with the states, to “lead with urgency and resolve.” 
Negotiators are meeting every week, Shawcroft said. They’re still working out how reservoirs including Flaming Gorge on the Utah-Wyoming border will be managed. 
Over the summer, they considered a new way of dividing the river based on how much water would flow in the basins if humans never dammed it or funneled it away for cities, farms and other uses. But the “natural flow” plan hit a wall. 
“We couldn’t come to agreement,” Shawcroft said. “Concepts, however, of the natural flow, will likely be included in where we go from here.” 
He noted the Central Utah project, which pipes Colorado River water to cities and farms on the Wasatch Front, is a junior user, meaning it’s among the first in line to absorb cuts in a shortage. 
Shawcroft said the state has to be judicious when the water runs low and compensating farmers to conserve water can help.

State reaches $500,000 settlement with retailer after inspectors discovered hundreds of price discrepancies at stores across the state.

Walgreens has agreed to pay $500,000 to settle claims of overcharging at its stores in Vermont — including in one instance where an item rang at the register $23 higher than its shelf price, the state Attorney General’s Office said Wednesday.
“Deceptive advertising harms consumers and the marketplace, and it will not be tolerated,”
Attorney General Charity Clark said in a statement announcing the agreement.
Walgreens, which operates nearly 8,000 stores in the U.S., did not “contest the facts” in the settlement and cooperated with the investigation, according to the agreement. The company did not return calls for comment. 
The pricing discrepancies were discovered in a routine inspection by the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets’ weights and measures program, according to the agreement, released Wednesday. The inspections involved visits to the stores to make sure that shelf prices of items matched the prices at the registers, according to the attorney general’s statement.
Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for the attorney general, said the “pattern of pricing inaccuracies” uncovered during the routine checks at the stores in Vermont prompted the opening of a larger investigation to determine what was going on.  
Between 2018 and 2024, the statement added, the state inspectors found 416 overcharge errors, with the overcharges ranging from 4 cents to $23 per item, with a median overage of $1.92.
The inspectors randomly selected products at the stores, from personal care and health items to groceries, according to Vath.
The Walgreens stores included locations in Barre, Brattleboro, Bristol, Burlington, Colchester, Enosburg Falls, Essex Junction, Fair Haven, Hardwick, Manchester Center, Middlebury, Milton, Montpelier, Morrisville, Newport, Rutland, Shelburne, South Burlington, St. Albans, West Rutland, Williston, Wilmington and Winooski.
Vath said the parties reached a settlement before a lawsuit was filed.
Investigations leading to settlements with retailers related to overcharging claims are not “terribly uncommon” in Vermont, according to Vath. In one of Vermont’s largest such cases involving price discrepancies, the state settled with Dollar General in 2017 for $1.7 million. 
Under the terms of the Walgreens settlement, in addition to the $500,000 payment, the retailer is required to submit third-party pricing audits from stores to the Attorney General’s Office for the next three years and correct any inaccuracies.
Walgreens “has explained that the acquisition of Vermont Rite Aid stores and the challenges in store operations and staffing associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were the primary catalysts for Walgreens’ heightened failure rate in the year 2022,” the document stated. 
“Walgreens’ overcharge rates improved significantly in 2023 and 2024, decreasing each year,” the document added. 
Of the $500,000 that Walgreens has agreed to pay the state, the settlement calls for $25,000 to go to the Community Health Center of Burlington, which works to provide affordable health services to Vermonters.
The remainder of the settlement money will go to the state’s general fund.

Mikie Sherrill (D) said Wednesday she will resign from the House of Representatives next week before becoming New Jersey's new governor in January. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Rep. Mikie Sherrill used her final speech to Congress Wednesday evening to blast a bipartisan bill to end the government shutdown and urge her fellow Democrats in the House to stop its GOP members from becoming “a ceremonial red stamp” for the Trump administration.
Sherrill said she will resign her House seat next week to transition to her next job as New Jersey’s governor. Her resignation will allow Gov. Phil Murphy to initiate the special election to fill her vacancy in the 11th district, which covers parts of Morris, Essex, and Passaic counties. Sherrill will be sworn in as New Jersey’s 57th governor in January.
Speaking briefly during fiery debate on the funding bill, Sherrill said she would not vote for it because it “does nothing to protect over 450,000 New Jerseyans who will see their health care premiums skyrocket.”
The funding bill does not include a provision Democrats like Sherrill pushed for that would extend federal subsidies for health care plans bought on the individual marketplace. Costs for those plans are expected to rise dramatically in the new year when the subsidies expire.
Sherrill pointed to her Navy background and told her House colleagues she swore an oath “to run toward the fight,” adding that she would “stop at nothing to lower costs and build opportunity for everyone.”
“To my colleagues, do not let this body become a ceremonial red stamp from an administration that takes food away from children and rips away health care,” Sherrill said. “To the country, stand strong. As we say in the Navy: Don’t give up the ship.”
A number of candidates have already lined up for the chance to replace Sherrill in the House, including former Rep. Tom Malinowski and Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill.
Sherrill joined Congress in 2019 and was reelected three times. Her current term expires in January 2027.

Free.,"Arizona’s Adelita Grijalva sworn in to US House, signs Epstein petition",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/arizonas-adelita-grijalva-sworn-us-house-signs-epstein-petition,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to office Wednesday after a delay that U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson attributed to the long government shutdown, but that critics allege was because the Arizona lawmaker pledged to be the deciding signature on a petition to release the so-called Epstein files.Grijalva, who was elected on Sept. 23, has publicly vowed to add her name to a bipartisan measure that would force the House to vote on the release of files from the government’s investigation of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.The Trump administration said in July it would not release further information related to the case. President Donald Trump had campaigned on releasing the files.Grijalva, Arizona’s first elected Latina, called the delayed ceremony an “abuse of power.”“It has been 50 days since the people of Arizona's 7th Congressional District elected me to represent them. … One individual should not be able to unilaterally obstruct the swearing-in of a duly elected member of Congress for political reasons,” said Grijalva, who filled the seat occupied by her late father, Raúl Grijalva, who died earlier this year.“Our democracy only works when everyone has a voice. This includes the millions of people across the country who have experienced violence and exploitation, including Liz Stein and Jessica Michaels, both survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse,” Grijalva said. “They are here in the gallery with us this evening.”To cheers from her Democratic colleagues in the chamber, Grijalva said she was going to sign the petition “right now.”  Massie, Khanna lead petition driveAs of early September, the discharge petition, led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., had garnered the signatures of all Democrats and four Republicans, leaving the petition just one shy of the 218 signatures needed to bypass Johnson and force a vote on the House floor.The three Republicans who joined Massie in signing were Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.The petition forces to the floor, likely at some point in the next few weeks, a Massie-sponsored resolution from July compelling the Department of Justice to “disclose all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein” and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted on federal sex trafficking charges.  The resolution attracted 50 cosponsors, nearly a dozen of them Republicans.Johnson defends delayGrijalva and her supporters have outright accused Johnson of delaying the swearing-in because of the Epstein petition.“When the American people vote, this chamber respects their will and seats them immediately. Politics should never come into play,” said Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., on the House floor moments before Johnson administered the oath to Grijalva.Democrats pointed to the fact that Johnson has previously sworn in other lawmakers when the House was not in session. Johnson argued in mid-October that Grijalva hadn’t yet been sworn in because she won her special election after the House went home on Sept. 19, followed shortly thereafter by a government shutdown on Oct. 1.  “As soon as (Sen.) Chuck Schumer opens the government … we'll have that as soon as we get back to business,” he said. At a press conference on Oct. 15, Arizona Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego accused Johnson of protecting “pedophiles, whether it's involving Donald Trump or any of his rich, elite friends.”Trump had a well-documented friendship with Epstein. Trump maintains he booted Epstein from his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, because the financier had poached young female employees.A deluge of Epstein documentsNew emails revealing details about the relationship between Trump and Epstein surfaced Wednesday. Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released three exchanges with content suggesting Trump was aware of Epstein’s abuse of underage girls. Republican leaders on the committee soon followed by releasing more than 20,000 documents they received from the Epstein estate.Reports also surfaced that the Trump administration had reached out to two GOP lawmakers, Boebert and Mace, about removing their names from the petition.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to confirm during Wednesday’s briefing that Trump had met with Boebert in the Situation Room, a secure center of national and global information for the president.“I'm not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room,” Leavitt said when asked about Trump approaching Boebert to remove her name.Boebert’s office pointed States Newsroom to the lawmaker’s afternoon social media post that read,“I want to thank White House officials for meeting with me today. Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”Mace’s office did not respond to questions to confirm the White House reached out to the South Carolina lawmaker. Rather, Mace’s Communications Director Sydney Long said, “​​The Congresswoman is not removing her name from the discharge petition because of her personal story.”Mace has publicly shared her own story of sexual assault.",,,,2025-11-12 18:57:08.730459

This story by Tom McKone was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 6, 2025.
While doing research about the Civil War, Champlain Valley Union High School social studies teacher Tyler Alexander found an image of an 1872 painting by Julian Scott titled “The 4th Vermont Forming Under Fire,” which he hoped to include in a new book.
The problem was, at least initially, it appeared that no one in Vermont knew the painting even existed.
Internet searches were no help, and it was a few months before Alexander got his first good lead. Years ago, a Texas insurance company asked Vermont art historian Robert Titteron, who had written a book about Julian Scott, to appraise the value of the painting Alexander was seeking, and he still had the written communications. The last known owner was the University of Houston — and not only did the university still have the painting, it was about to auction it off.
Alexander quickly contacted David Schutz, the Vermont State Curator, who immediately contacted Vermont historians Howard Coffin and Kevin Graffagnino. With less than a week before the auction, there was no way to secure state money, so Coffin and Graffagnino asked Vermont Country Store owner Lyman Orton, who owns the largest private collection of Vermont art, for help.
Orton won the bidding for the painting and agreed to lend it to the state for display in the Statehouse’s Cedar Creek Room, which already had four other Civil War paintings by Scott, including “The First Vermont Brigade at the Battle of Cedar Creek, Oct. 19th 1864,” a 10-by-20-foot mural commissioned by the legislature and unveiled in 1874.
Skip forward 151 years, to Oct. 29, 2025, and an unveiling that brought Alexander, Orton, Coffin, Schutz, Graffagnino, a uniformed contingent from Vermont’s Civil War Hemlocks, and scores of other Vermonters to the Cedar Creek Room.
Alexander read a vivid description of the battle from one of the letters in his book, Coffin described the battle portrayed in the painting, Orton talked about his affinity for Vermont art, and Schutz reminded everyone that the Statehouse opened only two years before the Civil War started, and was, in a sense, baptized by that event.
A native of Johnson, Vermont, 15-year-old Scott joined the war as a drummer and fifer. He made camp and battle sketches during the war, and after it, he became a trained artist. Not only is his newly discovered painting on display at the Statehouse — it is also on the cover of Alexander’s new book, “If I Can Get Home This Fall: A Story of Love, Loss, and a Cause in the Civil War” (University of Nebraska Press 2025).

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE, Kan. — Government, university and community leaders commemorated the opening Wednesday of a state-of-the-art convention center at the University of Kansas, which is equipped with amenities meant to draw thousands of annual visitors and generate revenue to pay off the university’s large-scale development project.
More than 100 people milled about the center’s grand entrance hall and conference rooms to hear Gov. Laura Kelly, university chancellor Douglas Girod and three others praise the teamwork and vision behind the University of Kansas Conference Center. They predicted a future of economic and community prosperity before cutting a ceremonious red ribbon held by the university’s mascots, Big Jay and Baby Jay.
The center is part of the project to revamp the school’s football stadium and northern campus entrance to create the Gateway District. The project could cost up to $808 million, and it relies heavily on state and local incentives, along with funding from the Republican-led Kansas Legislature and private donors to subsidize development.
The conference center is expected to be among the first steps in producing a return on those public and private investments.

“Not only will this facility benefit the greater Lawrence community, but it will also attract out-of-state visitors, spurring significant economic activity,” said Kelly, a Democrat. “Today marks a major step towards completion of the first phase of the university’s Gateway District project.”
The 55,000-square-foot center is the first of its kind in Douglas County. Kelly said the conference center has “required an intense collaborative effort.”
It is adjoined to the David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium, and the center’s visitors can access a patio that puts them at eye-level with players and coaches. Conference center users can also access stadium amenities, including the digital scoreboard, meeting rooms and various offices, said Girod.

The university envisions galas, weddings, conventions, trade shows and other large social events as potential uses for the center, said Girod. Event bookings already stretch into 2027, he said.
“As a result of this design, it really positions us to host all kinds of events, bringing out-of-town visitors into our community,” Girod said, “and that’s really what it’s all about at the end of the day, to generate additional economic activity to the city, county, state and beyond.”
Girod said he hopes the new center will attract events from around the world. An estimated 400,000 people visit Lawrence annually. KU’s Rock Chalk Park soccer complex on the western edge of the city is currently under consideration for hosting a team base camp for the 2026 World Cup.
The conference center isn’t a typical one, in large part because of its location, Girod said.
“Right in the heart of Lawrence, right at the foot of the hill, right at the base of campus, right at the gateway of our campus, and, of course, as part of our stadium,” he said.

The Legislature allocated $35 million to the project in 2022 from American Rescue Plan Act funds. It received $50 million in grant funding in 2023 from the Kansas Department of Commerce, which required a three-to-one match of private funds. The city of Lawrence approved in August a $95 million package of incentives, including the city’s first Sales Tax and Revenue, or STAR, bonds, which allow the city to finance the project with nearly $86 million in bonds. Once built, the development’s revenues and sales taxes will pay off the bonds.
Now that phase 1 is complete, the roughly $300 million phase 2 is expected to begin once KU’s football season ends, said Girod.
The second phase is expected to begin with renovations to the east side of the football stadium and construction of a parking garage and a 150-room hotel. A roughly 440-bed student housing complex, outdoor event plaza and retail, restaurant and office space are expected to follow, extending use of the area beyond football season.

Nearly 1 million people are predicted to visit the Gateway District annually once the project is complete in 2030, according to a feasibility study submitted to the city of Lawrence. Developers expect the district to produce a net economic output of $84.9 million and more than 1,600 full-time jobs.
“Today marks a shift in what is possible in Lawrence,” said Kim Anspach, the executive director of Explore Lawrence, the city’s tourism arm.
Capacity often restricted the city’s ability to host and grow events, she said. The center helps create a “steady rhythm of activity,” which helps support the year-round stability of the local economy.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)Advocates for food aid called Wednesday for the state to participate next year in a federal program aimed at making sure children don’t go hungry during the summer when school meals are not available.
Advocates with the Save the Children Network and Iowa Hunger Coalition called for the state to participate in the federal SUN Bucks program, also known as Summer EBT, in 2026. Participants access benefits through a Electronic Benefits Transfer card that can be used to buy food at retail stores.
The state this year launched an alternative pilot program called Healthy Kids Iowa, which is now ending.
The organizations gave a petition with more than 600 signatures to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ office Wednesday, saying the state is leaving $29.4 million in federal funding on the table by not participating in the federal summer nutrition program. The SUN Bucks program, which became a permanent program in 2024, provides eligible low-income families with $40 per child each month when school is not in session — $120 total — through an EBT card.
The state chose not to participate in the program in 2024 and 2025, with Reynolds saying she had opposed the program as it does not ensure families are buying nutritious food using the funds. Hunger advocates have criticized the governor’s decision, saying the choice is leaving funding on the table that is available for Iowa families in need.
While Iowa has not participated in Summer EBT, federal funding was awarded this year for a separate summer nutrition program: the Healthy Kids Iowa pilot program. This alternate summer feeding project, approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May, provided eligible families with a premade box of food each month worth $40, available for pick-up at 266 access points — largely local food pantries — across the state. The governor said in August the program is a more efficient way to address summer food insecurity, as some Iowa food banks “said that they can actually buy up to six times more food than a person using that SUN Bucks program at retail prices.”
Though hunger advocates and food bank officials said they were supportive of the additional funding available for addressing food needs through Healthy Kids Iowa, some said the program presented its own issues. Families faced transportation barriers in getting to the food banks to pick up boxes, advocates said, and pantries struggled to meet the increased demand and work required to implement the program.
Paige Chickering, the Iowa state manager for SCAN, was one of the organizers dropping off the petition. Chickering said while the Healthy Kids Iowa program did help address some food needs over the summer this year, she said participating in Summer EBT would help more Iowa families in need.
“Healthy Kids Iowa was only able to serve less than a third of those who would have qualified for Summer EBT — which does make sense, it was about a third of the funding, and so the goal of the program was to serve about a third of those children,” Chickering said. “But put that in perspective, Summer  EBT would serve 245,000 eligible children statewide, and Healthy Kids Iowa, the goal was to serve about 65,000 kids.”
The USDA granted a waiver for $9.1 million for Healthy Kids Iowa that would have otherwise gone toward Summer EBT program funding. This amount is a significant shortfall from the $29.4 million available to serve 244,000 children statewide through Summer EBT, Chickering said — though participation would require Iowa fund half of the administrative costs for the program, roughly $2.2 million.
While the USDA approved Healthy Kids Iowa funding in 2025, federal funding may not be available in 2026, Chickering said. Healthy Kids Iowa received federal dollars because was a pilot program, she said, but typically, “there’s an expectation that if a program like that is to continue, it would need to be state-funded.”
“I believe … that’s what would have to happen with Healthy Kids Iowa,” Chickering said. “And now we’re back to this disparity with Summer EBT, right, if Iowa were to put state dollars into a program, they can only do so much with those state dollars. Even if they were to match that $9 million that happened for Healthy Kids Iowa this year, we can only serve so much need that way — whereas, the state could just put in $2.2 million to receive that $29.4 million in federal funds through Summer EBT. And if we think about return on investment and how to stretch our funding and budget further, that really seems like a no-brainer.”
Chickering, alongside Luke Elzinga, board chair of Iowa Hunger Coalition, said there have been discussions on implementing similar restrictions on Summer EBT that are in place for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Iowa that would limit the purchase of unhealthy foods and beverages. Elzinga said in June the coalition was not able to persuade the governor to pursue SUN Bucks implementation with these restrictions in place.
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the petition or future plans for summer nutrition programs in 2026.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Ryan Friedrichs, vice president of Related Companies and husband of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, is a vice president in the company that is now pushing the development of a 1-gigawatt Oracle and OpenAI data center in a rural Washtenaw County township.
The connection between Friedrichs and the data center was first reported by conservative news outlet The Midwesterner. The Detroit News also previously reported that Friedrichs was a registered lobbyist in Michigan for the company, although Benson’s campaign provided proof that his lobbying license was terminated for the state in May.
Still, his role as the vice president of Development with Related Companies, which is the parent company of Related Digital, which is developing the project, has opened up questions about potential conflicts of interest if Benson should win the Democratic gubernatorial primary and go on to win the race for governor next fall.
Related Companies is based in New York and owned by Stephen Ross, a billionaire who also owns the National Football League’s Miami Dolphins. Ross has had close ties to Benson’s over the years, as she was the CEO of the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality. He has also donated to her campaign for governor to the tune of $8,325, according to Benson’s July campaign filing with the state.

The multi-billion dollar data center project would be the largest such data center in Michigan history, a facility expected to create 2,500 union construction jobs and 450 permanent jobs on site, with 1,500 more planned throughout the community to support the center.
Construction on the project is expected to begin in early 2026, with Related Digital and Oracle Cloud developing the facility as part of Oracle’s partnership with Open AI. DTE Energy confirmed it will supply 1.4 gigawatts of load for the facility, marking its first contract with a data center.

But the project is only moving forward after a legal settlement was brokered between the developer and the host community, which has opposed the project. A Washtenaw County judge approved a settlement between Related Digital and Saline Township, with the developer and the owner of the 575 acres of farmland slated for the project filing suit after the Township Board voted 4-1 against rezoning the land for the project.
Environmental activists have also warned that data centers can deplete groundwater aquifers and disrupt ecosystems through thermal pollution of surface waters, in addition to pollution with PFAS, methane and other harmful chemicals. They also have raised concerns for utility  ratepayers who might be affected by the project.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has since filed a notice with state energy regulators intervening in DTE Energy’s request to approve two contracts allowing them to supply power to the data center.
As The Midwesterner noted, Friedrichs cheered on the data center project on social media, including his LinkedIn page.
Michigan Advance reached out to Benson’s campaign for comment and to answer three questions.
The Advance asked the campaign if Friedrichs would step down from his role at Related Companies if Benson becomes governor and the data center project moves forward, considering he would be involved in a company that has a clear state business interest.
The campaign was asked if Benson supported AI data centers and more specifically the Saline Township project, considering the ecological damage environmental advocates say they can cause and other community concerns.

On the perception issue, Benson’s campaign was asked if they were worried about the optics of the candidate’s husband being so closely tied to a controversial project.
The campaign, in an emailed response, did not directly answer those questions and sent over two statements from campaign manager Nikki Goldschein and Benson supporter state Rep. Carrie Rheingans.
Goldschein did at least address the question of whether Benson supported the project being led by the company that her husband works for.
“Transparency and job growth will always be at the forefront of Jocelyn Benson’s administration and she’s made that clear from Day 1 of this campaign,” Goldschein said. “This new data center will create thousands of jobs in SE Michigan, but Jocelyn knows that neither this nor any other data center can be built at the expense of Michiganders’ already high electricity bills or access to clean water. We look forward to seeing these concerns addressed as public engagement on this project moves forward.”
Rheingans touted Benson’s commitment to transparency.
“Jocelyn Benson has successfully led our state’s second-largest agency for the past seven years, demonstrating unwavering commitment to transparency, integrity, and efficiency on behalf of the people of Michigan,” Rheingans said. “To suggest that her ability to lead as governor would be compromised because of her husband’s professional work is not only unfounded but frankly sexist. Her record speaks for itself: Jocelyn Benson has proven time and again that she is more than capable of leading effectively, independently, and in the best interest of all Michiganders.”

It shut down last month because of financial problems.
It was the second charter school in two years to close during its first year, raising questions about whether North Carolina’s “Ready to Open” process does enough to ensure new schools are prepared.
Statewide, new charter schools have enrolled an average of 13 percent fewer students than projected in their first year, and only about one in four met their initial targets — a gap that has widened over the past two years. Yet the Charter School Review Board and its predecessor have approved nearly every school recommended for final authorization, granting approval to 28 of 34 schools in the past five years.
The “Ready to Open” process is a yearlong planning and review period meant to ensure new charter schools are prepared to open. Now, the review board is weighing major changes to that process, which officials say are needed to tighten oversight and set clearer enrollment and budget standards.
“This is about sustainability,” said Ashley Logue, executive director of the N.C. Department of Public Instruction’s Office of Charter Schools, which oversees the RTO process. “We want readiness to be assessed based on concrete evidence and data.”
The proposed changes would move the process from flexible guidelines to clearer, stricter standards. Schools would make two in-person presentations — in May and June — instead of a single final review. The Office of Charter Schools is also recommending higher enrollment minimums and raising the break-even budget threshold to 100 students, above the 80 required by law.
Board Chair John Blackburn said the board will take a closer look at schools with weak progress on enrollment or facilities, and may require yearlong delays before opening.
Vice Chair John Eldridge said many applicants underestimate the challenges of opening a school. 
“A lot of folks out there think that the application is the hardest part,” Eldridge said. “They’re good people. They have good intentions, and they don’t realize what’s going to happen once the green light gets pushed.”
Both Blackburn and Eldridge said the state’s process, while imperfect, remains stronger than those in many other states. They cited lessons from a recent National Association of Charter School Authorizers conference, where they found North Carolina’s system comparatively thorough.
Eldridge said that in states like Arizona, charters are sometimes approved after a brief “Shark Tank”-style pitch session — a process he described as evidence of how “wild west” charter authorizing can be elsewhere.
“We left that event almost reaffirmed about our application process,” Blackburn said. “[It] can always be improved,  but it’s quite, in my opinion, strong compared to other states. We were rather stunned to hear and interact with other authorizers who were learning about basic things about the charter—its budget, its personnel plan, recruitment efforts—after the charter had already been given, rather than upfront.”
The North Carolina Coalition for Charter Schools, which represents charter operators statewide, said it supports the board’s effort to address the problem of schools that fail to meet enrollment goals, but the group cautioned against overregulation.
When new schools can’t open on time because of low enrollment, “It’s not good for the school and it’s not good for the students who expected to go to that school,” said Dave Machado, executive director of the coalition in a statement to NC Newsline.
“So the question is, how do you regulate enough to avoid that outcome, but not so much that you actually discourage new schools from trying to open in the first place?” Machado said.
Machado is a former member of the review board.
The review board will accept public comment over the next month before finalizing recommendations in December. If adopted, the new standards would take effect for schools opening in 2026.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AdobeStock_CharterSchool-wo.jpg,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Beer distributor Byron Schafersman said the availability of buzz-inducing “THC” seltzers that South Dakotans are increasingly finding at bars and liquor stores across the state is jeopardized by a provision in congressional legislation to reopen the federal government. 
“What I can tell you is consumers said loud and clear that they want this product,” said Schafersman, of Global Distributing, based in Renner. “And now it’s getting ripped away.” 
The provision could wipe out a whole range of hemp-based products ranging from those seltzers to lotions used for arthritis pain, according to Katie Sieverding, who lobbies on behalf of both the hemp industry and beer wholesalers in South Dakota.
“My fear is that we’re going to sweep in products that we weren’t even thinking about,” she said. 
The language in the U.S. Senate’s stopgap spending package — which was expected to gain approval from the House and President Trump on Wednesday night — caps the allowable high-inducing compound (known as THC) in any hemp-derived consumer product at 0.4 milligrams per container. That’s a fraction of what’s found in the 5- to 10-milligram beverages and gummies, for example, now sold in stores. It’s also less than what is found in many of the non-high-inducing “CBD” products, often sold as pain-relieving oils, lotions and balms, according to Josh Schneider, the policy adviser for the National Industrial Hemp Council.
Schneider said the U.S. hemp industry generates roughly $26 billion annually, with “well over $25 billion” tied to hemp-derived compounds like CBD and THC. Schneider said the new cap would dismantle those markets, eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, and strand years of investment in processing and extraction facilities.
Hemp in South Dakota
While Sieverding said most of the hemp grown in South Dakota is for grain and fiber, a small share of South Dakota hemp farmers do rely on CBD and hemp-derived THC products. 
Production of hemp, which is low in THC, was federally authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, which defined hemp as cannabis with no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. The intent was to legalize non-intoxicating uses like hemp fiber for things like clothing and CBD for things like joint pain relief. But critics say it also created a loophole: manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Since then, hemp-derived products with intoxicating effects have taken off.

In South Dakota, hemp became legal to grow in 2021, and the state now harvests more hemp for fiber than any other.
Ken Meyer, a board member of the South Dakota Industrial Hemp Association and co-chair of the U.S. Hemp Roundtable’s Farmer Advisory Council, said most South Dakota hemp is grown for grain and fiber, not for use in intoxicating products. Regardless, he said the change would devastate small retailers that serve clients who don’t want to obtain a patient card for medical marijuana, which has been allowed in South Dakota since the state started its medical marijuana program in 2021.
“These are adults who don’t want to go to dispensaries,” Meyer said. “They just want something to help them relax or manage pain.”
‘Every AG is seeing it’
A Nov. 4 letter from 39 state attorneys general, including South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, urged Congress to close the hemp-derived THC “loophole.”
“This is something that we in the attorney general community have been dealing with, especially with the sale of these products to minors,” Jackley said. “Every AG is seeing it.” 
South Dakota legislators passed a law in 2024 that closed a portion of the loophole by banning chemically synthesized versions of THC, sold under names like Delta-8 and THC-O, sometimes called “diet weed.” Jackley’s office recently conducted a sting and found five smoke shops allegedly in violation of that law.

Jackley said South Dakota’s hemp industry should remain focused on agricultural and industrial uses, not the sale of “these dangerous chemicals marketed to minors.” He said people in need of those products can apply for a medical marijuana card. 
News welcomed by medical marijuana industry
Ned Horsted runs 605 Cannabis, which grows medical marijuana and has a medical dispensary in the state. He called the federal legislation “encouraging,” given that his industry is tightly regulated and tested — which is costly — and he views it as unfair that comparable legal standards for hemp-derived intoxicating products were not being applied. 
“We need a free and fair market,” he said.

Hemp growers, retailers targeted in section of government shutdown legislation

Horsted was involved with an unsuccessful past effort to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. He said if that effort had succeeded, today’s “loophole” would not have have transformed into the market it has in South Dakota.
“Our bill said you would have to be 21 to buy any of this, and there would be far more oversight and regulation than what is on the products that are currently alleviating consumers’ demand for THC,” he said. 
Horsted noted that South Dakota’s Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee has heard numerous complaints during its last two meetings that “smoke shops” are selling illegal and intoxicating products, often getting into the hands of minors. 
At its Nov. 4 meeting, members approved a motion urging the creation of an interim study committee to investigate the issue and another recommending that sales of THC products be limited to licensed medical marijuana dispensaries.
Smoke shops and CBD
Caleb Rose helps run what some people describe as a “smoke shop,” selling hemp-derived THC products ranging from CBD to gummies and vapes. He is part-owner of Black Hills Vapors and Black Hills CBD. 
Rose said that because the proposed THC cap applies per container, it will mean many non-intoxicating CBD products he sells will no longer be available.
“We’re going to lose a lot of those topical products that are completely non-psychoactive,” he said. 
He said there would still be legal CBD options, but they would be costly and may be less effective. 
Rose estimated a 30% hit to his business and argued that the biggest losers are people using THC seltzers and gummies as “better alternatives” to things like drinking alcohol or pain-relieving pharmaceuticals.
Bad for beverage sales
Schafersman’s Global Distributing sells 5- to 10-milligram, hemp-derived THC seltzers. He emphasized that the products are low-dose, contrasting them with some higher-milligram vapes and edibles sold at “smoke shops.” 
He also said beverages are a safer, more controllable way to consume THC than gummies or vapes, particularly due to the physical limits on overconsumption, noting, “a child can’t just go and chug 10 of these at a time.” The company has turned down offers to sell drinks with higher milligram levels.
“We’ve concluded smaller milligrams is a key to us making sure that people have a good experience and they’re not overconsuming,” Schafersman said.
He said the nation’s alcohol distribution model is already designed to keep products out of kids’ hands.

 “I’m not selling this to anybody who doesn’t have a liquor license. Nobody who doesn’t have a beer license. I’m not selling it to the little pot shops,” he said. 
Schafersman said that while demand for alcohol has decreased, especially among younger people, there is growing adult consumer demand for THC beverages. He said the federal legislation will force layoffs if it becomes law.

 “It’s going to be a huge, huge negative for us at Global Distributing,” he said. “This is a multi-million dollar market in the state.”

The federal grand jury indictment accuses Williamson and four other co-conspirators, including Becerra’s former chief of staff, of funneling $225,000 in money from a dormant campaign account. Williamson is also accused of falsely claiming more than $1 million in business expenses on her taxes, which were instead used to purchase luxury handbags, charter jets and a nearly $170,000 birthday trip to Mexico.


Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, and three co-conspirators were indicted Wednesday on 23 counts of bank and wire fraud, allegedly committed from 2022 to 2024, during her time working for the governor. 
The indictment, first reported by the Sacramento Bee, alleges that Williamson, a longtime Democratic strategist, worked with Greg Campbell, a prominent Sacramento lobbyist, and Sean McCluskie, the former chief of staff to former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, as well as two other unnamed co-conspirators to steal $225,000 from an unnamed former official’s dormant campaign account for McCluskie’s personal use.
“Collectively, they funneled the money through various business entities and disguised it as pay for what was, in reality, a no-show job,” FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said in a news release. 
Prosecutors allege that Williamson and one of the unnamed co-conspirators, described only as a former California public official who owned a political consulting firm, used their political strategy firms to funnel money out of a campaign account, believed to be Becerra’s, into an account controlled by McCluskie. They allegedly disguised the funds as payments for McCluskie’s spouse, who was described in the indictment as a stay-at-home parent.
Williamson is also accused of falsely claiming more than $1.7 million in business expenses on her taxes. She used the funds to purchase luxury handbags, chartered jets and a nearly $170,000 birthday trip to Mexico, the indictment alleges.
Williamson, wearing what appeared to be a gray robe and in shackles, broke into tears from time to time at her arraignment hearing Wednesday afternoon in Sacramento. She pleaded not guilty to the charges and her attorney demanded a jury trial. Williamson is expected to be released on a $500,000 unsecured bond and put her house up as collateral. She has until Nov. 26 to post bond.
She will be released under supervision and must surrender her passport and other travel documents, among other conditions for her release. Her attorney, Matthew Rowan, declined to speak to reporters following the arraignment.
Williamson, who previously held a high-level position in Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration, was well known for her negotiating ability. When she left his office, Newsom said in a statement that he would miss her “insight, tenacity and big heart.”
The indictment indicated that Becerra had no knowledge of the scheme, and he confirmed as much Wednesday afternoon in a written statement via his spokesperson, Owen Kilmer.
“The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,” said Becerra, a prominent candidate to succeed Newsom in next year’s gubernatorial election. He added that he had fully cooperated with the U.S. Justice Department and would continue to do so. 
“As California’s former Attorney General, I fully comprehend the importance of allowing this investigation and legal process to run its course through our justice system.”
A spokesperson for Newsom distanced the governor from his former top aide. 
“While we are still learning details of the allegations, the governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity,” said Izzy Gardon, Newsom’s spokesperson, in a written statement. 
“At a time when the President is openly calling for his Attorney General to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one’s peers,” the statement said. 
Patel, the special agent in charge, said in a news release that the charges were “the result of three years of relentless investigative work.”
Prosecuting attorney Michael Anderson said Wednesday that prosecutors will hand over more than 27,000 pages of documents and an additional 750 gigabytes of evidence related to the case as part of the discovery process.

Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year is thrown into disarray.,"HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE advanced a major bill that could scale back the state’s ambitious efforts to fight climate change.  
House members of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy greenlit the measure, H.3469, sponsored by Mark Cusack, the Braintree Democrat who co-chairs the panel. Seven House members of the committee, all Democrats, voted in favor of the bill, while four reps held back from casting an up or down vote, according to Ana Vivas, a spokesperson for House Speaker Ron Mariano.  
Cusack previously told CommonWealth Beacon, which first reported the legislative effort, that he is aiming to move the measure out of the House with a floor vote before lawmakers break for the year on November 19. 
Wednesday’s vote is the first sign that Cusack’s legislation, which would cut the state’s energy efficiency program and could render its 2030 climate mandate unenforceable, has some legs among Democrats, many of whom voted for those goals just four years ago, and is gaining traction in the House.  
And it’s a concrete signal of the political muscle being exerted by at least one part of the Democratic supermajority on Beacon Hill to soften its commitment to fight climate change and invest in clean energy in the name of energy affordability. 
The legislation, which CommonWealth Beacon obtained on Monday, details a scenario in which the state’s 2030 climate commitment to halve pollution compared to 1990 levels could become “advisory” if those goals are missed because of actions taken by the federal government. President Trump has kneecapped the clean energy transition by halting new offshore wind permits and pulling money meant to spur uptake in solar power and electric vehicles. 
Cusack’s bill also caps the Mass Save program at $4 billion, a $500 million cut from its current budget, and rolls back the amount of renewable energy that utilities are required to purchase.  
The measure is ushering in an unexpected — and messy — debate over the state’s overall policy push to meet its 2030 climate commitments as Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability package filed earlier this year is thrown into disarray. 
Cusack is moving forward with an entirely new bill tackling affordability outside of regular procedure, meaning he can move on his own track through the House without consent from his counterpart on the joint energy committee, Sen. Michael Barrett, a Lexington Democrat. The bill would eventually still need Senate approval to become law, however, something that is likely a long shot. 
“People always criticize the process when they can’t criticize the substance of the bill,” Cusack previously said when asked if the measure is more for messaging or negotiation than something that can become law. “We took the perspective of, what’s a bill that saves the ratepayer money, makes our commitment to clean energy, and our competitiveness economically? That was the focus. It wasn’t a focus of, can I get 21 votes in the Senate? I don’t serve in the Senate. Not my monkey, not my circus.”  
Environmental advocates, who were quick to react to Cusack’s plan with vows to fight it, are planning a rally at the State House on Thursday, according to an invitation viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
On Thursday, the joint energy committee will hold its first hearing since Cusack went public with his plan. He and Barrett are both expected there.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/State-House-at-night.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

(Courtesy Haymel de la Vega)A Cuban immigrant held in a Torrance County immigrant detention center faces a key court hearing Thursday without what he described as crucial legal documents to help him avoid deportation.
Rogelio Bolufé told Source New Mexico in a phone interview in Spanish on Tuesday that an abruptly cancelled meeting with a legal aid group last week hobbled his chances at convincing an immigration judge to spare him deportation to Cuba, where he says he’ll face imprisonment and torture as a political dissident. 
“If I go back to Cuba, my life will be in danger,” he said.
His allegations of denied access to lawyers and legal materials occur as the facility, one of three ICE lockups in the state, operates without a contract. It currently holds about 550 ICE detainees.
Amid a federal government shutdown, an inter-governmental services agreement between the county, ICE and private prison operator CoreCivic expired Oct. 31, and it remains unclear when it will be renewed. 
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sent a letter to ICE on Friday demanding the agency answer what authority it has to continue detaining immigrants in Estancia and transfer ICE detainees out of the facility in the meantime. 
Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

“I reiterate my calls for ICE to close the facility, but if you will not, I urge you to transfer all ICE detainees out of TCDF immediately until such time that the contract between ICE and Torrance County is extended,” Heinrich wrote. 
Innovation Law Lab, an organization of immigrant legal advocates who visit the jail weekly, have said ICE’s own policies require the agency to remove detainees and their equipment absent a contract. 
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiry Wednesday about Heinrich’s letter, which cites recent Source New Mexico reporting and public statements from ICE about its continued operations during the shutdown. Luis Soriano, Heinrich’s spokesperson, said Wednesday that ICE hadn’t responded to the senator’s office yet. 
Bolufé, 43, told Source the contract’s expiration worsened a long practice of officials’ denying legal help to him or his fellow detainees, including a canceled meeting with legal advocates last Thursday. Bolufé documented that incident and others in a letter last week to Source signed by six other immigrant detainees. 
Bolufé’s letter also cited poor quality telephone communication; jail staff disruptions to consultations with legal staff; and lack of access to the jail’s legal library.
“In practice, it is impossible to access the legal library,” Bolufé wrote, noting he made 30 requests through jail tablets for appointments at the legal library and received no response.
Torrance County’s ICE detention agreement set to expire in two days amid federal shutdown

Haymel de la Vega, Bolufé’s close friend and former fianceé, facilitated brief jail phone calls between Bolufé and Source this week and sent Source letters detailing his history in ICE custody. She wrote that she’s tried to send books and other legal materials to Bolufé at the facility without success.
“I have personally sent Rogelio several legal books and materials intended to support his preparation for court, but these have been withheld pending review and approval by the facility’s director, and as of today, they have not been delivered to him,” she wrote on Nov. 7.
Rubena Miranda, administrative supervisor at the facility, declined to comment Wednesday, and referred comment to public affairs officials at CoreCivic. CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said the company would provide a response, but had not by publication. Source will update the story if it is received. 
A long journey to NM
Bolufé arrived at the Torrance County jail about two months ago and, he says, has spent some of his time collecting testimony from inmates who, like him, spent time at “Alligator Alcatraz.”
According to Bolufé, he spent between seven and 10 days in “Alligator Alcatraz,” during which he was chained by his hands and feet for 24 to 36 hours at a time. The facility had freezing temperatures, inadequate blankets and the lights remained on permanently. 
As a result of the treatment, he said he lost mobility in his left hand, as well as other pain, numbness and muscle weakness, and jail guards shouted racist slurs at him and other detainees. 
Bolufé said the letters and accounts of abuse would help him plead his case to federal immigration Judge Brock E. Taylor, and bring the allegations about ICE’s treatment of detainees to the judge’s attention, but they are among the materials he has yet to receive, along with a character reference signed by 40 people. He also intends on Thursday to argue that he would be subject to political persecution upon being deported to Cuba.
Bolufé is seeking a Green Card under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which allows Cubans a streamlined path to permanent residency. While he acknowledges and media reports confirm that he has long-standing ties to former Cuban President Fidel Castro and his sons, he also said he is waging a campaign to liberate the country from the Communist regime and supports President Donald Trump. 
Bolufé said his Green Card application was pending when he was arrested in the Miami area in August, accused of possessing a small amount of cocaine. He denies the cocaine belonged to him, and the charges have since been dropped, according to court records. Prosecutors in Miami-Dade County did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request on Wednesday about the case.
Ahead of the court hearing Thursday, Bolufé said he is hoping for the best, but he said his case is just one of many of immigrants who have been subject to abuse, deprived of human rights and threatened with deportation without having committed crimes.

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) Clay Schexnayder, former speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, was charged with felony theft Wednesday in connection with a missing piece of historic cypress that had been on display at the State Capitol and was last seen at his legislative office in Gonzales.
An East Baton Rouge Parish grand jury handed down an indictment against Schexnayder, 56, accusing him of felony theft and malfeasance in office. The felony charge applies to items having a value of $25,000 or more. 
The Advocate first reported in September on the disappearance of the 20-foot by 6-foot piece of cypress, taken from a tree believed to have been nearly 1,300 years old when it was harvested in 1936 from the swamps of Lake Maurepas. The board was gifted to the state in 1955 by Walter Stebbins and placed in a showcase on the ground floor of the State Capitol until about 15 to 20 years ago.
Stebbins’ grandson, Dr. Julius Mullins of Baton Rouge, reached out to state officials to help locate the missing cypress. He got his first break in the case when he saw Schexnayder on television being interviewed at his office, and the cypress board was in the background.
Schexnayder told the newspaper one of his predecessors as speaker, Rep. Chuck Kleckley of Lake Charles, had given him the board in 2013 for his legislative office because Schexnayder represented Ascension Parish, the area where the cypress had grown. Kleckley has said he doesn’t recall that account of how the board ended up in Schexnayder’s possession. 
Schexnayder, who reached his term limit last year, did not respond immediately to a call and text message. He told WAFB-TV on Wednesday he doesn’t know what happened to the board after he vacated his office. 
“I left the board and computer stuff there for the state to pick up,” Schexnayder said. “I left it there like any representative does. What happened to it, I don’t know.”
The property manager of the strip center that included Schexnayder’s office told The Advocate his employees did not remove it.  
Attorney General Liz Murrill, who was among the state officials Dr. Stebbins asked for assistance to find the cypress piece, sought the indictment against Schexnayder.
“You don’t get to keep State property. It doesn’t belong to you,” Murrill said through her spokesman.   
Schexnayder said he has only received one call from the attorney general’s office about locating the cypress, adding that he is willing to work with the agency to recover it.
“I’m very shocked and would have thought they would have followed up with me or had a sitdown meeting,” he said. “I told them I was willing to help them find it, but there’s been no follow up.”
Schexnayder, a Republican, held the House speaker’s post from 2020-24 with the backing of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. He had represented House District 81, which included Ascension, Livingston, St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes, since 2012.
Although the House Republican Caucus and state GOP power brokers endorsed Rep. Sherman Mack, R-Albany for the speaker’s role, Schexnayder emerged as a compromise candidate who gained votes from all 35 House Democrats and 23 Republicans. Mack received the other 45 Republican votes.
In 2023, Schexnayder ran for Louisiana secretary of state and finished fourth in the primary election.
During his time as speaker. Schexnayder created controversy when he hired his stepsons to remodel his two apartments in the Pentagon Barracks housing that lawmakers use. The state refused to pay for the work, leaving Schexnayder responsible for covering the $48,000 cost.

(Photo by Larry N Young/Getty Images)The Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wildlands Defense, Native Ecosystems Council, and Council for Wildlife and Fish sued the U.S. Forest Service in federal district court in Utah for approving logging and burning throughout the Dixie National Forest’s Pine Valley Ranger District in southeast Utah. Kevin Wright, supervisor for the Dixie National Forest, authorized the project’s implementation by signing a Decision Notice in May 2025.
The project will log, masticate, roller mulch, and burn 127,667 acres, which is a substantial portion of the 209,731 acres of the Pine Valley Ranger District.
It’s scientifically shown that logging and burning may actually increase the severity of wildfires by opening up the forest floor to more solar radiation and wind. But we are challenging the Forest Service in court because it’s violating the Dixie National Forest Plan, which has specific requirements for Northern Goshawk, big game winter range, and old growth habitat.
Plan would destroy old growth forests that are critical to Northern Goshawk and Pinyon Jay habitat
The Dixie Forest Plan requires the agency to maintain at least the minimum level of goshawk habitat needed to ensure a viable population. Yet the Forest Service failed to even estimate how much habitat is required for goshawks according to the best available science, or how much habitat will be destroyed by the project.
The Dixie National Forest Plan requires the agency to manage each drainage in the forest to ensure that 7% to 10% are old growth forests. The agency’s own data shows that the forest currently has less mature and old growth than required. In spite of this, the Pine Valley project calls for logging and burning even more of what’s left of the old growth forest.
The sad fact is that goshawk numbers have plummeted. Given that goshawks are very specifically dependent on mature and old growth forests, which are already severely lacking in the Dixie National Forest, the project would only result in even more destruction of critical goshawk habitat.
Moreover, Pinyon Jay populations have nosedived — plummeting by over 85% in the last 50 years — mainly due to habitat loss caused by Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management deforestation projects. Yet this project will add to that decline by destroying the very pinyon pine and juniper trees that Pinyon Jays rely on to survive.
Big game will suffer
Much to the disappointment of hunters, the Dixie National Forest’s deer population was at 57,000 in 2023. That’s 10,000 deer below their objective. The Forest Plan requirement for big game habitat requires the agency to maintain at least 30% of shrub plants in a mature age, and at least 10% in a young stage in big game winter range.
Yet the agency’s knee-jerk reaction to this population decline is to burn even more of the juniper and other forage plants that deer need to survive the winter. Last summer a lightning-caused fire already burned through the roadless areas in Pine Valley. Hunters surely can’t be happy that the federal government wants to spend their tax dollars destroying even more big game habitat.
Plan won’t reduce wildfires — but will harm public health
The Forest Service claims they are doing this to protect homes from wildfire. But the agency’s top wildfire scientist found the only way to effectively protect homes from wildfires is by having nonflammable roofs and decks and trimming shrubs and trees up to 100 feet out from a house. Anything beyond that is a waste of money and destroys wildlife habitat.
The Forest Service estimates it will take 10 years to complete the project, which means people in southeast Utah will have to suffer through 10 springs and falls of smoke-filled air. According to Dr. Brian Moench of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment: “Prescribed burns have never been shown to reduce the public’s overall exposure to forest fire smoke. In fact, a recent study found that as many people die from prescribed burn smoke as from wildfire smoke. It’s unfortunate that the only way to protect public health from 10 years of Forest Service malpractice is to take them to court.”
Forest Service already lost on these same issues in 2006
The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the Alliance and against the Dixie National Forest on these same issues in 2006. Yet the Forest Service is routinely operating outside the law by destroying wildlife and their habitat. By doing so the federal government is forcing grassroots forest activists to exercise our First Amendment rights and the citizen enforcement provisions in the law to challenge their decision in court. That’s exactly what we’re doing.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1295640096-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

ST. JOHNSBURY — There’s a special election happening this week, and it’s just for fifth graders. More than 1,000 fifth graders across the state are casting their ballots for Vermont’s first Kid Governor. It’s part of a new civic education program led by the Office of the Vermont Secretary of State. Vermont joins Connecticut, New Hampshire, Nebraska and Oklahoma as one of five states with a Kid Governor program.
On October 16, fifth graders at the St. Johnsbury School held a primary to elect their school’s nominee. 
Kara Abare was one of the candidates. 
“I noticed a lot of things in Vermont, and some of them weren’t so good,” Kara said. “And I was like, ‘We need to fix that.’ So then I started running.” 
The St. Johnsbury School is one of 65 Vermont elementary schools involved in the Kid Governor program. Any fifth grade class — including homeschool groups — can sign up to participate. Students learn about state government and elections using free materials provided by the Kid Governor program and the state.
Then, at some schools, students build platforms around an issue they care about. Student candidates campaign at their schools, and then seven finalists move on to a statewide election, where all the students vote. The winner becomes Kid Governor, the six runners-up form a cabinet, and together they spend a year working with state officials to bring their ideas to life.

Robyn Palmer is the director of civic and voter engagement at the Office of the Vermont Secretary of State. She helped start the Kid Governor program in Vermont, and she and other state officials will work with the winning students after the election. 
“We’ll have monthly meetings where we go over their platform and help them put it into practice,” she said.
Palmer said the Secretary of State’s office appreciates that the Kid Governor program is more than just reading about civics in a textbook. “Yes, it’s learning about how elections work,” she said. “But really, it’s focused more on helping students identify a topic that they’re passionate about, and then think about ways that they can make a difference about it.” 
Palmer said she’s been surprised by how much interest there’s been in the program in its first year. “Our goal was to get at least seven schools signed on for our pilot year,” Palmer said. “And without that much work, we got 65 schools signed on almost immediately, all across the state.”

She’s also been surprised by the big issues students are addressing in their campaigns, like homelessness and food insecurity. 
Kara Abare’s platform tackled one big issue — health insurance.
“About 20,000 people don’t have [health insurance] in Vermont, and that’s a lot of people,” she said. Kara Abare’s classmate, Max Cloutier, also focused on healthcare. “My dad was diagnosed with a disease that can’t be cured,” he said. “And my platform is to try and help the people who try to cure those diseases, to help them do their work.”
Pam Letourneau-Fallon is one of the fifth grade teachers at the St. Johnsbury School. She actually encouraged the Vermont Secretary of State’s office to adopt the Kid Governor program. She used to teach in Connecticut, where Kid Governor started.

She loves the program because of its hands-on approach and real-world application. “This is not a pretend election,” she said. “The stakes are high. Their platforms will become a reality.”
She said the stakes are high for another reason, too. According to Vermont’s 2025 Youth Civic Health Survey, fewer than 60% of Vermont youth say they plan to register to vote when they’re old enough. 
“I believe the Kid Governor program is going to dramatically increase those numbers,” Pam Letourneau-Fallon said. “I can’t see any of these students not voting in elections moving forward. They’re invested.”
None of the St. Johnsbury students advanced to the statewide election for Kid Governor. Still, Kara Abare said, the process taught her a lot about leadership. “A good leader, for me, it means making an example for yourself so others can look up to you and do the same things you’re doing,” she said. “Like, if you’re nice and kind, then they’ll be like, ‘Wow, I want to be like Kara,’ and then they’ll be nice and kind.”
The polls close today, and the Secretary of State’s office is set to announce the election results on November 19. The new Kid Governor will take office in January, following an inauguration ceremony at the Statehouse.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — While they did not see eye-to-eye on much, a Louisville Republican and Democrat both said that increasing housing stock should be a priority for Kentucky’s legislature in 2026.
During a Louisville Forum luncheon panel on Wednesday, two Republican and two Democratic state lawmakers largely disagreed when it came to changes to Medicaid backed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress earlier this year. But the lawmakers did find some common ground in wanting to better their communities in the state’s largest city. 
Kentucky Today Editor Lawrence Smith moderated the panel, which included Republicans Majority House Whip Rep. Jason Nemes and Sen. Julie Raque Adams and Democrats Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong and Rep. Joshua Watkins. The discussion served as a preview of topics in store for the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January. Lawmakers will decide the next two-year state budget, meaning that significant dollars can be allocated to various programs, resources and projects across the state. 
Nemes said that a priority for him is “bringing home as much money to Louisville as I can,” earning some applause from the luncheon crowd. He added that he views Louisville as the “economic engine” of the state. 
Raque Adams said there is a “push-pull between this urban and rural divide.” However, she said Louisville’s downtown “fared really well” as the General Assembly allocated $100 million across two years to revitalize the area in 2024. 
“Our General Assembly is primarily made up of rural legislators, and so a lot of times when the budget comes over from the House, our metropolitan areas don’t fare as well,” she said. “And so we really have to work together, House and Senate, to make sure” metropolitan areas are not left out. d.” 
Raque Adams also said that suburbs should get more attention in the budget this year, particularly when it comes to developing more housing. 
Chambers Armstrong said “Kentucky only succeeds when we take care of our neighbors and when we show up for each other.” She was critical of federal changes to Medicaid in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that could lead to rural health care providers losing money and hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians losing Medicaid coverage. 
Chambers Armstrong said she would file a constitutional amendment to keep the state’s Medicaid expansion intact and a bill to increase diaper access for low-income families. However, she is a member of the minority party in a state legislature with GOP supermajorities. 
She said she’s hoping to see a state budget “that reflects our Kentucky values and puts loyalty to D.C. or an administration aside to say, ‘We take care of our people, we show up for our people, and we invest in folks,’ because that means investing in our state.” 
Watkins said he agreed with much of what other lawmakers said but stressed that affordable housing is a “paramount” priority for his district. He is a Realtor and a member of the Kentucky Housing Task Force, a special legislative committee. 
“We have our different opinions about what’s happening in Washington, but if we don’t get serious about housing, we won’t have a Kentucky that our future generations will be proud of.” 
One Big Beautiful Bill Act
Raque Adams and Nemes accused Democrats of using a “scare tactic” by saying Kentuckians would lose coverage and hospitals would close. Both Republicans said that the Republican changes would help make Medicaid “sustainable” in the long run. Raque Adams said Republicans will file a bill in the statehouse that focuses on redetermination and eligibility for Medicaid recipients as well as legislation to permanently put into state law work requirements for working age, non-disabled Medicaid recipients.
Nemes said Medicaid is “not managed appropriately, and it’s time that we make a significant review of it, which is what we’re doing in the General Assembly.” 
Chambers Armstrong said that her position was “not a scare tactic” and pointed out that UofL Health delayed a South End birthing center project “indefinitely” following Congress approving the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. She also argued that the legislature’s failure to raise the minimum wage has not helped Kentucky workers. 
“This is not something that is happening a long time from now. This is not something that is happening to other people. This is something that’s happening to our neighbors and our community. And I believe that it is the job of our General Assembly to protect Kentuckians and to stand up when the federal government is doing things that are going to hurt our people.”
Taxes
Republicans in the General Assembly have successfully passed reductions in the state income tax in recent years, with the goal of ultimately eliminating it altogether. However, the state’s revenue and budget numbers for the last fiscal year did not meet the legislature’s self-imposed threshold for considering another income tax rate cut in the 2026 session. 
But Nemes said he does “not accept the premise that we didn’t meet the requirement this year because of emergencies.” State tax deadlines were delayed due to severe storms, and Nemes maintains that the state should “re-measure” the budget for an income tax reduction next year. 
“I’m fully for a reduction of another full half of a percent, from 3.5% to 3%. … But if I can’t convince my colleagues to go down a full half of a percent, we need to go down a quarter of a percent,” Nemes said. 
Chambers Armstrong said that the “people who benefit the most” from lowering the state income tax are “the folks who need the benefit the least” and that income tax cuts don’t do much to help poor and low-income Kentuckians. She added that she thinks it “would be irresponsible” to permanently change state tax policy now with federal funding still up in the air. 
Watkins agreed with and added that there are ways other than lower taxes to attract businesses to Kentucky. “A business thinks about quality of life for its workers and its families,” he said. “If you don’t have the neighborhoods to live in, if your people can’t find health care … businesses think about that.” 
Louisville schools
Jefferson County Public Schools, the state’s largest public school district, often gets the attention of the General Assembly. Asked if lawmakers are still thinking about breaking up the school district, Nemes praised the work by new Superintendent Brian Yearwood to increase student performance. 
Out of respect to Yearwood, Nemes said he would not “be the catalyst” for such legislation to disband the school district within the next year, but “if we don’t get it in the right direction, something has to happen.” 
Watkins, the only Black lawmaker on the panel, said that teachers are “having to do more today than they ever had to do when I was in school.” He added that on top of educating students, teachers are asked to support students without proper resources and that criticism of the Louisville schools often comes with a racial subtext.
“When we talk about the success of JCPS and its failures, oftentimes we are couched in discussions in communities and households with peoples and families and students that look like me. And when we think about the progress that JCPS has had with what it has to do as a public school system, that’s very different from a private school.”
Raque Adams said she agreed with Watkins and argued that the school district has had “an explosion in Central Office and no money going to the classroom, going to the teachers, going to the schools,” referring to the higher salaries of administrators compared to most other employees. 
Chambers Armstrong also highlighted a proposal for universal Pre-K programs backed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. She said that can be a way to invest early in a child’s education and set them up for success later in life. 
Transparency
Shortly before the panel began, the League of Women Voters of Kentucky released an updated report on lack of transparency in Kentucky’s legislative process. The report expanded on issues the group highlighted at the end of the 2025 legislative session, such as fast-tracking bills in a manner that limits public notice and participation. 
Chambers Armstrong said she had not read the latest report but was familiar with the group’s previous ones. She recalled times when she felt legislation was being pushed through at a fast pace forcing her to quickly read through a bill that she just received before it was called to the Senate floor. 
“The way we get good legislation is we tell folks early and loudly what we’re working on, and we ask for experts to give us insight and feedback, and we change our legislation in response to that,” she said. When we rush legislation through, and we’re just trying to get it done and we’re cramming it in secret under the cover of night, that’s not good policy.” 
Raque Adams said she experienced what Chambers Armstrong described when she was a member of the House while Democrats were the majority party. She added that she believes most lawmakers “really do have good intentions, and they really try to do the right thing.” 
“It happens and it’s unfortunate. I think we all want it to be very transparent in the way that it’s supposed to be. But sometimes you’re under a constitutional deadline, and so you’re rushing to get things done, or you’re rushing to fix a bill, or you’re rushing to do that, and it’s unfortunate.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5432-e1762982695287-1024x765.jpg,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811

In a hospital room a year ago, Tlingit elder, water protector, and artist John Morris Sr. and I made a special discovery. Even though we’d talked many times about our connections to the Taku River, I’d forgotten to tell him about the woman’s decorative hair comb I’d uncovered in the dirt near the mouth of the Taku years earlier. I finally asked John if he recognized the name neatly etched on the back of this comb.
“Ah, that’s my grandmother! She must’ve lost it 70 years ago,” said John, tearing up. “She would load up the family into boats at our Douglas Island village, Akáx Yaa Andagán, so we all could go pick berries in August, before the coho started to swim upriver.”
John closed his eyes and cradled his grandmother’s comb, and asked me to tell him another Taku story.
I recounted a recent swim at Taku Harbor, where I’ve spent virtually every summer of my life. Wearing a wetsuit and goggles, I had slipped into the frigid, forest-ringed ocean, only about 100 feet from where I found the comb. I swam farther than normal that day and stopped, stunned, when the salty water suddenly turned sweet. It smelled and tasted of Sitka spruce needles, wild carrot blossoms, and watermelon berries. With a flash of excitement and recognition, I realized I was smelling the glacial stream that has raised generations of wild salmon flooding into the bay.
John opened his eyes and beamed. “I’ll be darned. Yes, I know just that sweet smell. Keep sharing your love of your home, of salmon rivers, Heather. You’ll remind others to speak of their love, too.”
John died three months later. His last words to me continue to reverberate in my mind and heart.
The big, braided T’aakū (Taku), Shtax’heen (Stikine), Joonáx̱ (Unuk), and Salmon Rivers, some of the last largely intact salmon rivers left on the planet, flow from British Columbia, Canada, across the border, and into Southeast Alaska and the Tongass National Forest. Indigenous nations like the Tlingit and the Tahltan have stewarded these wild, glaciated river valleys — collectively the size of Portugal — since time immemorial.
And here, in an ironic and miraculous piece of good climate news, scientists predict thousands of miles of new cold, clear water for salmon will emerge as vast glaciers melt — unless Canada permits mining companies to dig them up first.
Mining companies, rebranding this region as the “The Golden Triangle,” are  working hand-in-glove with the Canadian government to industrialize shared river valleys and build roads atop glaciers to extract tiny specks of gold and copper. Canada’s polluting gold mining boom upstream has largely escaped the world’s wider notice. Today more than 100 Canadian gold mine projects, most with massive earthen mine waste dams, are being explored or are operating here.
The Canadian government is incentivizing and fast-tracking this mining boom without the consent of all who are deeply connected to this place. A couple of years ago, I asked a CEO who will benefit from his proposed gold mine located just upstream of a vast emerald green wetland and refuge for salmon fry. He paused, laughed nervously, and replied, “Our investors.”
The “sweet water” smells John and I know well call the salmon home. Newly-hatched, inch-long salmon fry imprint the smells of the stream where they’re born in their olfactory systems before migrating to sea. Years later, this deep memory and the earth’s magnetic field guide salmon thousands of miles from the open ocean back to their birth streams to lay their eggs, but only as long as contaminants haven’t polluted this freshwater.
Unfortunately, these waterways, and salmon’s ability to navigate through them, are threatened with permanent mine contamination like acid rock drainage.
For decades, people have called for slowing Canada’s gold fever in this region. Many Alaskans and Alaska tribes have called for a pause in upstream Canadian mining until Indigenous peoples and communities on both sides of the border develop binding protections for shared rivers.
Native and local people sustained by salmon rivers like the Taku, Stikine, Unuk, and Salmon Rivers should determine their future  — not the distant corporations, hedge funds, and billionaire financiers behind today’s modern-day gold rush.
Amidst the current loud, constant push for power and profits, wild salmon quietly fill us with awe and are reminders of true wealth. As my friend John urged me, I will be speaking up for wild salmon rivers even more passionately than before.

By a 10-2 vote, the council backed the $9 million transfer of Vibra Hospital of Western Massachusetts and the Meadows nursing home in Leicester, along with the property they occupy. Some council members raised concerns about staffing and the financial stability of the facilities.
Everest Hospital LLC plans to take over operations of the 47-bed hospital, which serves patients with serious medical conditions requiring ongoing but non-intensive care. The company has pledged to retain all existing Vibra staff. According to a Public Health Council staff report about the application, Everest is not associated with private equity.
In that same report, Everest said that if the sale did not proceed, “Vibra would continue to operate the Hospital without the Proposed Project; however, the [nursing home]… likely would have been at risk for closure if Vibra had been unable to find a buyer.”
Council members pressed for details about the proposed transfer.
Mary Moscato, a long-term care management expert on the council, said she was concerned about the operators’ lack of Massachusetts experience, given the state’s complex regulatory landscape. Moscato, along with Lisa Blondet of the Massachusetts Association of Community Health Workers, voted against the transfer.
“I do feel that that is a concern going forward, especially from the applicant, who are three individuals who developed an LLC, Everest Hospital, in Massachusetts, and have not had any experience in operating health care centers in Massachusetts, and do not have any experience in operating long-term acute care hospitals,” Moscato said.
Everest’s three principals are Chaim Klein, a dentist, and Yisrael Klein and Yedidya Danziger, both of whom have administrative experience with skilled nursing facilities.
Danziger told the council that Everest plans to increase staffing to serve more patients. The hospital, licensed for 47 beds, is currently operating at roughly 50 percent occupancy under Vibra.
According to application materials, Vibra’s patient volume has declined since fiscal 2020. Everest called that drop “unusual” and attributed it to “staffing issues and the termination of a dialysis service provider who exited the business.” Dialysis services are expected to resume soon, which Everest said should help increase patient numbers.
By building a more stable workforce, Danziger said, the hospital would be able to serve more patients. 
“We’re going to go down to schools, we’re going to get schools to come in to do their rounds in the facility we intend to utilize, Indeed… directly recruit all forms of hiring with bonus structures and retention bonuses,” he said.
Vibra has relied heavily on travel nurses to staff the Leicester facilities, Danziger said. Everest plans to move toward a full-time workforce, staffing levels “accordingly” based on patient needs.
Many of Vibra’s travel nurses are local but employed through agencies, he added.
“Knowing they’re local makes a big difference, but I’m just puzzled as to why they would use an agency,” said council member Dr. Ramnath Subbaraman. “Generally travel nurses who are more mobile… they tend to cost a lot more. So it was a little puzzling to me why they would be using staff who are not more permanent if they are local.”
Danziger replied that “to be honest” he does not “fully understand as well” why Vibra relies on agency nurses.
“We honestly don’t understand fully why that’s being done, and that’s really why we wanted to try to bring them on board,” he said. “Because of what you’re saying. It’s significantly more expensive to have them through the travel agency… So I can’t fully answer that question, it predates our involvement.”
Everest’s application highlighted one advantage of the transfer: the operator would own both the hospital and nursing home, eliminating the role of Medical Properties Trust, the current landlord.
Medical Properties Trust was the landlord for hospitals operated by Steward Health Care in 2024 at the time that health system went bankrupt and collapsed, shuttering two Massachusetts hospitals in the process. 
“The real estate is not being held in a [Real Estate Investment Trust] and this Proposed Project would terminate Medical Properties Trust (Steward’s landlord) interest in the real property that it currently has with Vibra,” the application said. “The real property would be owned by the operator with no lease-back or unrelated third-party interests.”
The Health Policy Commission noted the deal is a cash transaction.
Moscato cautioned Danziger that Massachusetts’ long-term acute care hospital network “has little to no margin of operation.”
“Their operating budgets currently are very, very slim, if not negative,” she said. “Are you familiar with that? And upon taking this $9 million acquisition, that you might not get your return in many, many years?”
Danziger responded, “Absolutely, yes. It’s similar to any health facility when you initially take over any health facility, it’s expected that you don’t get returned for a very long time. So yes, we’re expecting that.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hospital.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 17:56:57.241811
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-12 21:57:18+00:00,CT Mirror,New CT housing bill poised to pass House during special session,Ginny Monk and Josie Reich,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/ct-housing-bill-special-session/,"The bill is a compromise between lawmakers, local leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont after he vetoed a major housing bill during session this year.","The state House of Representatives on Wednesday was poised to pass a replacement for the broad housing bill that the governor vetoed in June, a moment that has been months in the making for many Democrats.
The bill requires towns to create housing growth programs, changes minimum off-street parking requirements, expands fair rent commissions and incentivizes towns to take steps to allow more housing, among other measures.
Lawmakers drafted House Bill 8002 as a compromise with local leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont after Lamont vetoed the housing bill passed during the regular session. The House of Representatives debated the bill for most of the day during a special session Wednesday.
“We’ve done a lot of compromise,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “We’ve come together and talked about a lot of the things that were in former House Bill 5002. Here, we’re talking about what really is at the heart of what we were doing here and what we are doing now, and that is housing growth.”
Democrats passed House Bill 5002, a sweeping housing bill, during the regular session. Lamont, whose staff had worked on the bill with lawmakers, vetoed the bill weeks later. The governor said he wanted to get towns on board, and called for a special session to pass a negotiated version of the bill.
On Friday, several town officials, including some Republicans, stood alongside House Democrats and Lamont to announce the new version of the bill.
Republicans and some moderate Democrats voted against the measure. Much of the debate focused on the shortened timeline to debate the bill during a special session and arguments from Republicans that the bill would ultimately hurt towns.
Republicans argued that the bill hadn’t been released with enough time for the public to review it and hadn’t gone through the public hearing process. Concepts in the bill got public hearings during the regular session.
“I’m super disappointed in the lack of transparency in Democratic level from the top all the way down,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a morning briefing that support for the bill was clear at Friday’s press conference, when groups that opposed the bill in the last legislative session showed up in support, including members of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and the Council of Small Towns.
“On the floor, people throw things, it’s bombastic, that’s the world we live in. There’s theater to it,” Ritter said. “But you just take a step back and go, look who got there. It truly is a compromise.”
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said that local leaders at the conference were supporting a bill they hadn’t read, because copies had not yet been released.
“We have one-party rule in the state of Connecticut,” Candelora said. “So I’m guessing these individuals didn’t feel like they actually had a choice, and they had to try to get something for their communities, because the alternatives were much worse.”
Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said on Friday that there had been a bipartisan effort to find a solution that included Republican local leaders.
“We have leaders from the local level, from the regional level, certainly from the administration, from the legislature, advocates, all standing here trying to focus on the end game and focus on the prize,” Rojas said. “And the prize is advancing policy that creates homes for people and for families to live in here in Connecticut.”
CCM executive director Joe DeLong said town leaders with his organization as well as COST had worked on the legislation for months and offered multiple updates and presentations about the progress.
“Municipalities were in no way kept in the dark on any of this type of work,” DeLong said. He added that while there are some towns that would have preferred no bill pass, the issues raised were “systematically resolved” in the new bill.
COST executive director Betsy Gara said in a statement that there have been several improvements to the bill. 
“The bill is certainly not perfect, but it makes more sense from a planning standpoint. Our municipal leaders, as board members of their respective COGs [councils of government], have already been discussing ways of promoting housing development, including affordable housing, in their regions,” Gara said.
“The reality is that given broad support in the state legislature for a housing bill; something was going to pass. COST worked hard to mitigate some of the most onerous provisions in the bill to develop a more workable, balanced framework for addressing local and regional housing needs,” added Gara.
Still, some lawmakers opposed to the measure said they feared the bill would wrest power away from municipalities. Rep. Tina Courpas, R-Greenwich, said it was a “declaration of war” on towns.
“That destroys our longstanding tradition of home rule. It establishes an adversarial relationship between Hartford and the towns, which I do not think is beneficial to our communities, and it abrogates all of the local considerations and essentially sacrifices them at the altar of affordable housing,” Courpas said.
Supporters, as well as the organizations that represent towns, said local officials worked with lawmakers and the governor to develop the bill. Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, voted no on the old bill. She said the first selectman in her town, who spoke at the governor’s press conference last week, is now on board.
“I am grateful for the movement forward and for the opportunity to vote yes,” Berger-Girvalo said.
The bill says municipalities must either create a housing growth plan or participate in a regional housing growth plan. It includes specifications for what the plan must include, such as: what strategies the town will use to improve access to affordable housing, an inventory of developable land in the town and housing goals.
If towns do not create these plans, they are not eligible for temporary pauses from being sued by developers whose affordable housing plans are denied under the state’s affordable housing statute 8-30g.
The bill eliminates off-street parking minimums for residential developments with up to 16 units and allows towns to exempt two contiguous zones amounting to not more than 8% of the land.
In those zones, towns could require a parking needs assessment and developers would have to build no more than one parking space for each studio or 1-bedroom apartment and two spaces for each unit with two or more bedrooms, or the number recommended by a parking needs assessment paid for the developer. The requirement would be for whichever number is lower.
For towns that participate in certain types of zoning that increases density near transit hubs, the conversion of commercial to residential must be allowed for up to nine units, but the town can require that the ground floor stay commercial.
The bill also allows towns to access new state money if they comply with the housing growth plan requirements, meet specifications to allow more housing near train and bus stations or join the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority to increase density near public transit and downtown.
It says that towns with populations of 15,000 or more must create fair rent commissions or join a regional commission. Current law says towns with 25,000 or more residents must have these commissions. 
It establishes the Department of Housing as a statewide housing authority that can develop affordable housing on state land and in towns. It also bans “hostile architecture,” or tools such as armrests in the middle of benches or spikes that make it hard for people experiencing homelessness to rest or lie down.
“We are very excited that we have finally gotten to this point, and I am certainly grateful for all of the people who are standing here today, but I do want us to focus on the fact that the people who are not standing here today are the people who are counting on us and who have been counting on us for years,” said Planning and Development co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, during Friday’s press conference.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The gap between Rhode Island revenue and spending appears to have closed ever-so-slightly, though the outlook for the state’s fiscal 2027 budget remains bleak.
An extra $29.2 million is expected to flow into state coffers by June 30, 2026, equal to 3.3% of the $5.8 billion in general revenue expected for the year, according to new estimates adopted by state budget analysts Monday. The conclusion to the biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference also hiked revenue projections for fiscal 2027 by $173 million, assuming the state maintains the existing hospital tax rates.
An unexpected $202 million over the next two years is hardly sofa cushion change. But it’s little reassurance for state officials already facing a $300 million deficit heading into the year that starts July 1 alongside costly consequences from federal budget cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other social programs. 
“The results of the Revenue Conference are a welcome, albeit only slightly positive, update to our budget picture,” Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement Wednesday. “Our budget is otherwise significantly impacted by federal actions that limit access to affordable healthcare and critical services for many Rhode Islanders.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson also spoke to concerns over the impact of federal policy changes, which include bigger business tax breaks expected to diminish state revenue collections next year.
“Serious budget challenges lie ahead, particularly due to the impact of federal changes to health care, SNAP, and other vital services upon which Rhode Islanders rely,” Lawson said in a statement Wednesday. 
A series of state commissioned reports unveiled in October offered a broad and dire account of the human and financial losses that federal budget cuts will create in Rhode Island, where more than one-third of the state’s annual spending plan comes from federal dollars.
But the projected financial fallout still requires more analysis, and further federal guidance. Actions by Congress could reverse some expected losses, such as the Dec. 31 expiration of federal tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.
Job losses and spending cutbacks amid the record government shutdown could also drag down Rhode Island’s economy well after the federal government reopens, with consequences worsening the longer the shutdown drags on, a Moody’s analyst warned state budget analysts in October. 
Lawmakers are expected to devote much of the 2027 legislative session to understanding and compensating for federal funding cuts. The annual jigsaw act commences in earnest in January, when Gov. Dan McKee unveiled his version of a state budget, based on the newly updated revenue estimates.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
The $29.2 million revenue boost for the current fiscal year is driven by higher than expected personal income tax revenue, now coming in $55.5 million, or 4.4%, higher than projections from five months earlier.
Revenue from estate and real estate conveyance taxes contributed another projected $15.2 million, a 16.4% increase that potentially reflects the very early stages of an increase in the state’s real estate conveyance tax. The tax rose from $2.30 per $500 of value to $3.75 for all properties, with an extra increase on the sale of homes exceeding $800,000 (with an inflation adjustment) starting Oct. 1. 
The higher property tax revenue forecast does not account for a more controversial change to state property taxes that adds an extra tax on non-owner occupied homes over $1 million. The “Taylor Swift tax,” referred to because of its application to the pop star’s Westerly home, does not begin until July 1, 2026.
Lottery revenue also rose $10.3 million, or 4.1%, compared to prior expectations, driven primarily by video lottery and iGaming activity. In-person table gaming revenue and sports betting through Bally’s Corp’s two Rhode Island casinos slipped downward versus prior estimates.
The largest downward revision now expected in fiscal 2026 shows up in business taxes, now expected to come in at $33.4 million, or 4.7%, lower than five months ago.
Federal expansion of business tax deductions set to start in January, halfway through Rhode Island’s fiscal year, are expected to shrink state tax rolls by $79 million a year, according to state analysis. However, this could change if state lawmakers move to decouple state tax code from federal requirements, as they did for the 2025 tax year.
Tax revenue collected from financial institutions is now poised to be $9.7 million, or 51.2% less, while cigarette sales taxes are expected to drop $4.6 million, or 2.3%.
And, amid warnings of inflationary pressures and recession fears suppressing consumer spending, sales tax revenue projections have fallen 3.2%, or $581,707.

That effort is playing out largely through of pair of lawsuits filed over the last year by Eversource and Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, alleging that Gillett flouted state laws and exerted near total control over rate cases during her roughly six years spent as chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.
The allegations raised in those lawsuits, as well as mounting pressure from lawmakers, led to Gillett’s resignation on Oct. 10. 
Since then, attorneys for PURA have conceded in court filings that many of Gillett’s actions — including her decision to appoint herself “presiding officer” over hundreds of contested matters — violated the state’s Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. 
They’ve also offered to reconsider a 2024 rate case involving two of Avangrid’s gas utilities that is at the center of one of the lawsuits.
Attorneys for the utilities say that is not enough. They are seeking access to records and permission to conduct interviews with Gillett’s former colleagues regarding her alleged bias against utility companies — including allegations that she helped author an op-ed with two state lawmakers accusing the companies of “propaganda.”
“All of these issues remain in play, and we need to get to the bottom of it,” Perry Rowthorn, an attorney representing Avangrid said during a hearing Wednesday in New Britain.
The judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, at times during Wednesday’s hearing appeared skeptical of the utility’s argument, asking more than once why he needed to “get to the bottom of it.”
The state has agreed to send the underlying rate case — PURA’s decision to deny Avangrid’s request for an increase in gas rates and instead ordering the company to lower prices — back to regulators for a new set of hearings. In those hearings, Budzik noted that PURA has agreed to implement new procedures to correct the issues raised during Gillett’s tenure.
“I’m not sure what you want me to do other than say that this process was infected by all these issues and you have to do it over again,” Budzik said. 
Neither PURA nor Gillett responded to requests for comment on Wednesday. Gillett is currently serving as a senior fellow for the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit which describes itself as part of the “anti-monopoly movement.”
A colleague’s testimony
The utilities’ claims against Gillett were further bolstered last week when one of her former colleagues, PURA Commissioner Michael Caron, gave a deposition in which he said Gillett was a self-described “control freak” who appeared to harbor a bias against utilities.
Caron also called Gillett a “talented… borderline brilliant person” whose tactics were nonetheless controversial, even within the agency.
“There’s some who find her a champion [of consumers] and there’s some who believe she’s upending the regulatory compact,” Caron said, according to a transcript of the deposition. “I found that the decisions that have come out during her tenure tended to push costs out into the future. She wasn’t really saving the ratepayers anything.”
Caron’s deposition was delivered in a joint lawsuit, filed by Eversource and Avangrid in January, in which the companies alleged that Gillett had overstepped her authority by issuing hundreds of rulings on procedural matters without approval or input from her fellow commissioners. Caron stated in his deposition that he felt sidelined by Gillett, and that the chair limited his access to staff and information about pending cases.
On Monday, Attorney General William Tong’s office filed a complaint in that case accusing the utilities’ attorneys of using Caron’s deposition as a “fishing expedition” into other topics, such as whether Gillett helped to write the controversial op-ed or whether she attempted to cover up communications with the piece’s authors through an auto-delete setting on her personal cell phone.
Tong’s office is also seeking a pause in future depositions in order to get a court ruling limiting the scope of those proceedings.
In their response filed on Wednesday, attorneys for Eversource and Avangrid argued that their questioning of Gillett’s biases and use of auto-delete was necessary to determine whether those issues were present throughout the agency, including among existing staffers.
In addition, while the companies acknowledged efforts to reform internal procedures under Gillett’s successor, Interim Chairman Thomas Wiehl, they said those changes have yet to be fully put in place.
“To understand the ongoing problems at PURA, the parties need to have a truthful, straightforward understanding of what has happened over time to distort the agency’s internal procedures and decision making protocols, including what was done to hide, reinforce, or modify those procedures to avoid public scrutiny,” the companies said in their response. 
Both Gillett and the two listed authors of the op-ed, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, and Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, have repeatedly denied that she played any role in its drafting. Attorneys for Avangrid have sought to depose both lawmakers regarding the op-ed, though the state is opposing that effort. 
Steinberg and Needleman are co-chairs of the Energy and Technology Committee, which oversees legislation dealing with utility costs and regulations. 
“Chair Gillett is gone, I would have hoped that the utilities would have moved on,” Steinberg said in an interview on Wednesday. “It would be good for everybody if these lawsuits were resolved and PURA was allowed to focus on the things that matter to the people of Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_230-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Lee Zeldin, administrator for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, came to West Virginia on Wednesday to learn more about the Mountain State. 
But despite his position leading the agency responsible for protecting public health and the environment nationwide, his focus was more on the state’s energy and manufacturing industries.
Zeldin appeared at a roundtable Wednesday morning with Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. The event was not open to the public or the press.
In comments afterward, Capito said Zeldin was joining her to tour the Toyota manufacturing facility and the John E. Amos power plant, both in Putnam County, as well as the Nucor facility.
“[Myself and] Administrator Zeldin know that we need every single power source that we can and elongating [the lifespan of] not just our power plants, but also being able to create new power plants is going to be essential,” Capito said.
In an interview on MetroNews TalkLine earlier Wednesday, Zeldin was clear on where his interests lay during his visit.
“When you’re visiting these different businesses and industries, job creators, employees and you’re able to hear their perspective and make their perspective our perspective in decision-making, then West Virginia truly has that seat at the table at that agency,” Zeldin said.
Capito, in the same interview, said it was critical for the nation’s highest environmental agency to also be concerned with the economy.
“[The EPA] impacts every manufacturer, every coal and natural gas plant, every chemical [plant], so many jobs here,” Capito said.
The administrator — who was appointed by President Donald Trump last November and confirmed by the Senate in January — has spent his first year in office working to undo environmental protection policies enacted under former President Joe Biden.
He told MetroNews TalkLine that a decision will be released shortly regarding the repeal of a Biden-era rule regarding the operation of coal-fired power plants. 
That rule would have required coal plants with operations planned past 2039 to cut or capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032. Before the rule, there had been little oversight in the U.S. regarding carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.
While Zeldin did not specify exactly what the new, potentially repealed rule would look like, he did say the EPA would soon be “able to make the final decisions that will be a very big win, after win, after win for West Virginia.”
In comments to the press after his roundtable, he emphasized that coal will remain king in West Virginia. He did not, however, mention the very real health concerns faced by communities where coal-fired power plants continue to operate or any plans by his administration to curb those impacts. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and a significant driver of greenhouse gas emissions. 
When asked by WCHS TV’s Bob Aaron whether it was “realistic” to believe that new coal-fired power plants could be coming to West Virginia, Zeldin said he was focused on “making the economics work” to ensure coal remained a key power source.
“I have continued to see coal plants that were about to close staying open. Not only are they staying open, but now they are investing new money into their site. They are continuing to invest in capital improvements, and now, instead of closing the doors, they’re expanding their operations,” Zeldin said. “That is the direction that we want to go.”
Under Zeldin and the Trump administration, the EPA has started work to repeal dozens of policies and rules meant to keep the nation’s people — as well as its air, water and land — safer from toxins and pollution. The repeals have been touted by the agency as the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.”
The proposed repeals and changes undertaken include ending the agency’s regulation on greenhouse gas emissions, which are known to exacerbate climate change and harm public health; removing limits on soot pollution from smokestacks; undoing standards for mercury and other toxic air pollution; holding up funding to replace and remove lead pipes from drinking water systems; limiting the agency’s use of independent researchers and labs.
The changes have sparked concerns among both workers at the EPA and environmental advocates, who worry about the long term effects of such rollbacks, as well as the risks of politicizing the nation’s top environmental enforcement agency.
In June, nearly 300 EPA employees signed a letter sent to Zeldin rebuking the politicization of the agency and the partisanship that had taken hold there. They said politics and money had replaced science and law as the basis for decisions made by the agency. Under Zeldin, numerous employees were suspended and fired for signing the letter.
On Wednesday, Zeldin said his agency and the Trump administration believed that economic progress — through more non-renewable energy production and manufacturing — could coincide with protecting both environmental and public health. It was necessary, though, to find a balance.
“It’s not a choice between the two,” he said. “We’re excited about doing both again.”
Zeldin, however, did not specify how that balance would be found or practiced.

(Photo by Eros Hoagland/Getty Images)The University of North Carolina System gave the state’s public universities permission in September to raise tuition up to 3% for new students who enroll in the fall of 2026.
In-state undergraduate tuition has not increased in the UNC System for nine straight years. Despite the recommendations of university staff, UNC-Chapel Hill trustees weren’t prepared to raise it in 2026, either.
During a nearly three-hour presentation Wednesday, Nate Knuffman, UNC-Chapel Hill’s vice chancellor for finance and operations, made the case for a 3% tuition increase (roughly $211/yr) in in-state undergraduate tuition for incoming students starting next year.
Knuffman also recommended a $53 fee increase per student to cover the cost of a new student recreation and wellness center. Housing costs would rise an average of 7%, or $282 to $344 more per semester for residence halls, to address the current backlog of deferred maintenance projects. And Carolina Dining Services would also see a 3.9% increase (about 53 cents more per meal) to cover increased operating expenses and inflationary food costs.
“How do we know or is there any assurance that we can have that the tuition increases that we might make here, which affects our students and their families, that those dollars won’t end up going off of our campus?” asked trustee Ritch Allison.
Allison was referring to a performance model approved by the UNC System to increase campus efficiency and student outcomes. But the model was never fully embraced nor funded by the legislature, and the individual campuses were asked to contribute toward the creation of a $30 million performance pool. For UNC-Chapel Hill, that meant returning $10.8 million to the UNC System for the performance initiative.
While some of those funds are expected to return to Chapel Hill under the system model, Allison said it was difficult to support any new tuition proposal that would put greater costs on the backs of students and families if the funds would ultimately go to another campus.
“That’s really what I have a lot of angst about,” said Allison.
Knuffman said that when UNC-CH submits its proposal to system leaders and the UNC Board of Governors for consideration, they will note that they believe strongly that the dollars need to stay at Chapel Hill.
Trustee Marty Kotis, who chairs the Budget, Finance, and Infrastructure Committee, said he was opposed to any increase in undergraduate tuition for state residents. He said they should first look at raising tuition for out-of-state undergrads and graduate students.
“Board of Governors’s tuition policy says that campuses must demonstrate that they’ve exhausted all other reasonable levers before requesting an in-state tuition increase,” reasoned Kotis.

Trustee Jim Blaine said he objected to raising in-state tuition because UNC-Chapel Hill simply appears to spend far too much money wastefully.
Blaine pointed to UNC-Chapel Hill’s decision to spend $1 million for an external public relations firm, while employing 100 communications professionals at the school.
“It is really inconceivable to me that we subsequently have $11.5 million give or take wrapped up in people that do comms work at this school, [yet] we need to go out and hire a DC-based comms firm to do a million dollars in PR work,” said Blaine. “If we do, we need to fire some of those 100 people and eliminate their salaries.”
Blaine clarified that he was not trying to single out any one department or individual, but he was concerned about  the external perception that the flagship university was being wasteful with its resources. He suggested that Knuffman rework his proposal to hold in-state tuition flat.

With several trustees now advocating against the first tuition hike in nearly a decade, Chancellor Lee Roberts was asked to weigh in on the proposed 3% increase for in-state students.
“We think it’s a very measured, reasonable increase entirely consistent with our obligations to the North Carolina Constitution,” Roberts replied.
Robert said he was worried the university has not yet received enrollment funding from the legislature, which left town without passing a comprehensive state budget.
“I worry about a dynamic in which we’re telling the General Assembly that we need the enrollment funding very badly and they turn around and say, well, you didn’t use the tools we gave you to help yourself with a tuition increase,” said Roberts.
UNC-Chapel Hill’s full board of trustees will debate the matter further on Thursday. Any increase recommended by the trustees would need to be submitted to the UNC System office by December. The UNC Board of Governors would have the final say in the first quarter of the new year.

The Bernadette Smith for U.S. Senate committee was created on Tuesday, according to Federal Elections Commission records.
Last week, Michigan Advance reported that Smith had resigned from the party and was rumored to be gearing up for a Republican U.S. Senate primary battle against Rogers of White Lake. Although Smith had not yet filed paperwork to form her campaign committee, the Advance found that a cloned domain name of bernadettesmithforsenate.com had been registered and that the URL redirected to Smith’s existing website. The domain name was registered in late October.
Republican sources who spoke to the Advance said Smith had been saying she was running for the Senate as a Republican in the weeks leading up to her resignation from the party.
Former Michigan GOP co-chair appears poised to run for U.S. Senate against Mike Rogers

The new candidate filing confirmed the Advance’s reporting and Smith’s plans to take on Rogers.
However, she will likely have a hard time making the ballot given the amount of support that has been rallied around Rogers, and the difficulties a candidate would face trying to jump in this late in the game. Major party candidates for federal office in Michigan cannot access the ballot via a filing fee and must submit at least 15,000 valid petition signatures, up to 30,000 signatures total. Petitions must also be signed by at least 100 registered voters in each of at least half of all congressional districts in the state.
The deadline for filing those signatures is April 21, 2026. With snow already falling on Michigan, getting out now to collect that many signatures could be a feat.
Dennis Lennox, a longtime Republican political and communications consultant in Michigan, said Smith’s challenges include “all of the above.”
“She has no path to making the ballot and no path to victory,” Lennox told the Advance. “If I’m Mike Rogers, I’m not worrying about this, and I would be focused on keeping my eye on the prize. Mike Rogers has to be careful not to get distracted by Bernadette Smith and be forced into pivoting back to a primary dynamic that doesn’t exist … while the Democrats deal with their own divisive intraparty fight here.”
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel in a statement believed that the new development could open up a messy primary on the Republican side if Smith were able to make the ballot.
“Mike Rogers is a loser who underperformed Trump by over 100,000 votes in 2024 because Michiganders didn’t want an out-of-touch Floridian representing them in the U.S. Senate,” Hertel said. “Now his flailing second campaign – in which Rogers has claimed there is no inflation, mocked Michiganders facing higher costs, and nearly lost a primary straw poll to a little-known ‘Stop the Steal’ ringleader – has apparently failed to earn the confidence of Michigan Republicans.”

The disciplinary case is one of two involving an array of IV-therapy clinics or spas in central Iowa that offer intravenous delivery of products and have used advanced registered nurse practitioners as their medical directors.
The first of the two cases involves advanced registered nurse practitioner Jennifer Penisten, who is currently taking the Iowa Board of Nursing to court and seeking judicial review of her recent 90-day license suspension.
In her lawsuit, filed under the name “Jennifer Peniston,” she argues the board improperly relied on her alleged confessions to misconduct rather than citing care issues involving specific patients.
Previously undisclosed Board of Nursing records indicate the board became aware of potential issues with Penisten’s practice in August 2023 when a retired physician in Ames, Mark Guffy, contacted the Iowa Board of Pharmacy and filed a written complaint regarding a Story County business called IV Therapy Services, where Penisten served as medical director.
“On their website they promote a number of their products which are given intravenously and for which, I feel, they make fraudulent claims,” Guffy wrote. “I am quite certain that their claims regarding the benefits of their products are not only deceptive (but) frankly fraudulent.”
Guffy said Tuesday his complaint was triggered after he went to his gym and saw a large banner promoting the clinic’s hydration therapy for people with hangovers.
“The banner said something to the effect of, ‘If you’re dehydrated after a night of drinking, we offer hydration therapy,'” Guffy said. “And I thought, ‘My gosh, this is a college town and you’re promoting this? This is crazy.'”
During its investigation, the Board of Nursing focused not on the products and services that sparked Guffy’s complaint, but on the nurse-licensing issues that fall more squarely within its jurisdiction.
In 2021, the board had accused Penisten of allowing a nurse to use her prescription authority to order Botox and dermal fillers. It also accused her of failing to see the patients who received the treatments, and failing to give direction on how to administer the drugs.
To resolve that disciplinary case, Penisten had entered into a settlement with the board, agreeing to see all patients for initial assessments and to provide treatment orders that were patient-specific.
As part of its 2024 investigation of the physician’s complaint, the board ultimately concluded Penisten had continued to engage in prohibited practices. It suspended her license for 90 days, leading to her court filing seeking judicial review of the board’s actions.
IV Therapy Services offered ‘alternative care’
During a December 2023 meeting with registered nurse Lauren Pearson, who owned IV Therapy Services, a Board of Nursing investigator asked Pearson about the launch of the business.
According to the investigators’ notes of the meeting, Pearson explained that she had contacted the Iowa boards of pharmacy, nursing and medicine before opening her clinic and “each person told her that it was a new business idea and a grey area.”
According to the board, clients would schedule appointments through the IV Therapy Services website and receive a health history and consent form to fill out and return. The consent form, according to the board, included an acknowledgment by the client that the services being provided were “alternative care and not considered medical treatment.”
Upon arrival for the appointment, the client and a staff nurse would decide which “IV cocktail” recipe the patient would receive based on symptoms and the client’s own requests. The nurse would then administer the drugs through a set of standing orders and protocols approved by Penisten in her role as medical director, the board claimed.
Vivid Life Spa, Vivid IV and Vivid Mobile Solutions launched
The board records indicate that in addition to her work for IV Therapy Services, Penisten opened her own aesthetics practices, Vivid Life Spa, in November of 2021 and served as the medical director there and at a separate entity she didn’t own called Vivid IV.
The board records also show Penisten launched a separate Des Moines business called Vivid Mobile Solutions that offered what she called “mobile IV vitamin infusions.”
Vivid IV’s website, board investigators noted, promoted “complementary cancer therapy.” The website currently advertises the therapy with prices starting at $129 per treatment.
The therapy is advertised as including high doses of vitamin C, which it says “produces hydrogen peroxide which is directly toxic to the cancer cells,” plus treatment with mistletoe that “can contribute to cancer cell death.”
The newly disclosed board records show that during a February 2024 interview with a board investigator, Penisten was asked about so-called “Botox parties” that may have been staged by Vivid IV.
“I informed her that I saw where Vivid IV was also performing Botox parties,” the investigator wrote. “I asked if she saw these clients prior to the administration of the Botox. At this point, Ms. Penisten stated she hesitates to say any more. She stated I was asking about Ms. Pearson, and now I’m asking about Vivid, and she can see how it correlates, but also doesn’t want to say any more, and feels she may need an attorney.”
Penisten was first licensed in Iowa in 2006 as a registered nurse. She is also a licensed advanced practice nurse prescriber in the state of Wisconsin, as well as in Iowa.
‘Imminent danger’ alleged by Live Hydration Spa
Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged the former medical director of another Ames health spa, unrelated to Penisten’s businesses, with wrongdoing.
The board accused advanced registered nurse practitioner Antoinette Thompson of Pleasant Hill with failing to evaluate, document or report the status of a patient; committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare; misappropriating medications or supplies of a patient; being involved in the unauthorized manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs in an unsafe manner; prescribing, dispensing or distributing drugs without accurately documenting the act or without evaluating the patient; willful or repeated failure to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety, and failure to query and reviewing the Prescription Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing or dispending of an opioid.
The Board of Nursing has not publicly disclosed the manner in which any of those regulations were allegedly violated or indicated when or where the alleged violations took place.
Court records indicate Thompson served as the medical director and nurse for the Live Hydration Spa in Ames until she was terminated when the business closed in September 2024.
According to a court petition filed by Live Hydration, Thompson’s termination was based on her “actions resulting in imminent danger to patient health and safety.”
The company has also alleged Thompson violated her franchise agreement with Live Hydration by opening a competing business that offered IV vitamin therapy, injections, hormone replacement therapy and Botox treatments.
Thompson denied all of the company’s allegations, and is now suing Live Hydration for breach of contract and defamation, alleging the company tried to “starve” her franchise and mount a hostile takeover of the Ames location — charges the company denies.
A trial is scheduled for Dec. 15, 2026. A hearing on Thompson’s disciplinary charges was scheduled for Oct. 10, 2025, but no board decision in the matter had been made public as of Nov. 12, 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BON-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

Free.,Government reopens after 43 days: Trump signs bill ending record shutdown,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-reopens-after-43-days-trump-signs-bill-ending-record-shutdown,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — The longest shutdown in U.S. history ended Wednesday night when President Donald Trump signed a spending package that  reopens the government and funds most of it through January.The Oval Office ceremony came just hours after the House voted to approve the legislation, which senators passed earlier in the week. “I hope we can all agree that the government should never be shut down again,” Trump said, before urging Senate Republicans to eliminate the rule that requires bills to garner the support of at least 60 lawmakers to advance. “Terminate the filibuster.”The 222-209 vote marked the first time that chamber took up a bill since mid-September, when Republican leaders recessed after members approved a stopgap spending measure they knew couldn’t advance in the Senate. That stalemate, centered around sharply rising health care costs, led to a 43-day shutdown that affected nearly every corner of the country through delayed funding for nutrition programs for millions of Americans, no pay for federal workers, flight delays tied to staffing shortages and much more. But after nearly six weeks of failed procedural votes, seven centrist Senate Democrats and one independent broke with party leaders on Sunday to advance the reworked spending package and then voted to approve the legislation Monday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who said throughout the shutdown he was interested in a bipartisan path forward on health insurance costs after the shutdown ended, committed to hold a floor vote on a Democratic bill “no later than the second week in December.”House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said repeatedly throughout the funding lapse GOP lawmakers have ideas to improve the health care system. However, he didn’t detail any of those publicly and hasn’t committed to a floor vote.

“We have volumes of ideas on how to do this, on how to fix it, on how to drive costs down and how to increase access to care and quality of care, and you're going to see all that vigorous debate,” Johnson said during a brief press conference after the vote.House debate on the spending package that will reopen government was largely along party lines, though Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida voted against the bill.Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Adam Gray of California, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state and Tom Suozzi of New York voted for passage. Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., urged support for the legislation ahead of the vote, saying “history reminds us that shutdowns never change the outcome.” “Over the last 43 days the facts did not shift, the votes required did not shift, the path forward did not change,” Cole said. “The only thing that did move was the level of pain Democrats inflicted on the nation.”Much higher premiums predicted Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the spending panel, rejected the legislation and said it does nothing to address the rising cost of health care. “More than 20 million Americans will have to pay double, even triple, their monthly insurance premium in just a matter of weeks,” DeLauro said. “And this bill leaves families without even a glimmer of hope that their costs might go down.”

The Senate significantly reworked the stopgap bill the House originally passed in mid-September into what is now a 394-page package, adding in three of the full-year government funding bills and changing the date of the stopgap measure to Jan. 30, among many other provisions. The original stopgap was set to last through Nov. 21. The updated measure gives Congress a couple more months to work out agreement on the remaining nine appropriations bills that were supposed to become law before the start of the current fiscal year on Oct. 1. Lawmakers could create a partial government shutdown if they’re unable to agree on approving the remaining appropriations bill before the new government funding deadline at the end of January.Democratic discharge petitionTrump will turn his attention toward the rising cost of health care that Democrats highlighted during the shutdown, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a Wednesday briefing, though she didn’t put a firm timeline on when he’ll release any plans.“Once the government reopens, the president, as he’s always maintained, is absolutely open to having conversations about health care,” Leavitt said. “And I think you’ll see the president putting forth some really good policy proposals that Democrats should take very seriously to fix, again, the system that they broke.”House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters following a closed-door meeting that Democrats will try to get the necessary signatures on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on legislation to extend tax credits for three years for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.The New York Democrat said the extension mirrors how long the enhanced tax credits were set to last initially in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Temporary health care subsidies were originally passed as part of the COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan in 2021 for two years. The Inflation Reduction Act, the signature climate policy bill from the Biden administration, then extended those health care subsidies for three years, expiring at the end of December 2025. “The legislation that we will introduce in the context of a discharge petition will provide that level of certainty to working-class Americans who are on the verge of seeing their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,” Jeffries said. Democrats will need the support of at least a handful of Republicans in order to get the 218 signatures needed to force a vote on the bill. The discharge petition was released mid-afternoon.What’s in the new billThe spending package wraps in several different bills and provisions, such as the three full-year funding bills that cover the Agriculture Department, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Legislative Branch, military construction projects and Department of Veterans Affairs.Included are:A stopgap spending bill that will keep the rest of the federal government running through Jan. 30;$30 million for the U.S. Capitol Police to enhance protections for lawmakers, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to bolster security for members of the judicial and executive branches, and $28 million for enhanced safety for Supreme Court justices;Language requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the thousands of workers it sent layoff notices to during the shutdown and preventing officials from firing those workers through January;Provisions mandating the Trump administration provide back pay to all federal workers, including those furloughed during the shutdown. Trump at one point during the shutdown had threatened to yank that back pay, though it is required by law.The Trump administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy a few hours before the House voted, saying the administration strongly supports the bill, describing the measure as “a fiscally responsible package that provides the full-year funding necessary to support the Nation’s veterans, farmers, and rural communities.”The package also “ends disruptions to programs the American people rely on and ensures the thousands of Federal employees who have been forced to work without a paycheck, such as air traffic controllers, will be promptly paid,” the administration added. The Agriculture and Military Construction-VA spending bills include tens of billions of dollars in earmarks requested by lawmakers from both political parties, important to them as midterm elections loom in 2026.‘Legislative self-dealing’ in Senate attackedBut not every Republican on Capitol Hill is happy with how the full-year bills turned out. Speaker Johnson announced mid-afternoon that the House would take a separate vote later this month to remove language from the package that will allow senators to file suit against the federal government if their data is subpoenaed.“We are putting this legislation on the fast track suspension calendar in the House for next week,” Johnson wrote in a social media post. The provision, tucked into the full-year Legislative Branch spending bill, is retroactive to January 1, 2022, and would apply to the eight senators who had their cell phone records subpoenaed during a 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7, 2021, for Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin said during floor debate the bill “contains the single most corrupt provision for legislative self-dealing that anyone in this chamber today has ever voted on.”“This provision is an affront to our taxpayers, to the rule of law, to everyone who believes that we in public office must be the servants of the people, not the masters of the people who get special legal rights and privileges and multi-million-dollar payoffs,” Raskin said. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters earlier in the day that he will “definitely” be filing a lawsuit after the new provision becomes law. “And if you think I’m going to settle this thing for a million dollars? No. I want to make it so painful no one ever does this again,” Graham said, later adding he wasn’t sure if he’d win such a case.Dissatisfaction among GOP lawmakers with that provision was on full display on social media, where Florida’s Steube responded to Speaker Johnson’s post by writing that the “Senate will never take up your ‘standalone’ bill. This is precisely why you shouldn’t let the Senate jam the House.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-12 22:56:43.537977

Bob Ferguson speaks to Andi Smith of the Ballmer Group after the announcement of a major new philanthropic donation to fund early childhood education on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, at the Denise Louie Education Center in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The Ballmer Group on Wednesday committed hundreds of millions of dollars for free preschool in Washington, a massive philanthropic contribution amid state budget cuts and federal rollbacks. 
The donation of up to $170 million per year for the next decade could fund 10,000 additional slots in the state’s Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, or ECEAP, for low-income families. The program currently has just over 14,000 slots statewide at over 460 locations.
The Ballmer Group was founded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie.
Gov. Bob Ferguson called the funding “truly transformative.”
“It’d be hard to quantify how significant that investment will be for our state,” Ferguson said at a press conference Wednesday, announcing the news at the Denise Louie Education Center in Seattle. 
As a condition of getting the gift, the state pledged no further budget cuts to the ECEAP program for the next 10 years.
Established in 1985, the Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, open to kids ages 3 and 4, is similar to the federally-supported Head Start. Washington’s program offers free early learning child care or preschool, as well as support services.
Children who participate in ECEAP are more likely to be “kindergarten ready” and less likely to need special education services, according to a 2022 Washington State Institute for Public Policy report. But as school goes on, it doesn’t necessarily correlate with better test scores or high school graduation rates. 
“We at Ballmer Group have been inspired by Washington state’s commitment to ensure that every eligible kiddo has access to high-quality early learning, and Ballmer Group’s role is simple: To help that vision move faster,” said Andi Smith, the organization’s executive director for Washington.
The exact amount the Ballmer Group will give each year will be determined by demand for additional slots and whether providers are available. It’ll likely be a years-long ramp-up to fully realize the investment.
“But we are going to be moving heaven and earth to make that happen,” Ferguson said.
The governor wants to enroll an additional 2,000 children in the program next school year. 
If the state raises ECEAP funding sometime in the next decade, the Ballmers would match that, leading to added philanthropic funding. Ferguson didn’t commit to taking that step, given the state’s ongoing budget challenges, but said, “I think we have to seize this opportunity and maximize it.”
State and federal headwinds
Facing a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall this year, state lawmakers targeted ECEAP to help fill the gap. 
They postponed expansions of the preschool program that would extend it to all qualifying low-income families and child care subsidies. They slashed about 12% of slots, totaling about 2,000, many of which were unfilled due to staffing issues. They eliminated state funding for an ECEAP program for toddlers younger than 3, affecting nearly 200 families. And they decreased funding for the state’s Complex Needs grant fund that supports providers serving children with disabilities, developmental delays and behavioral issues.
The cuts to ECEAP focused on part-day slots that might not appeal to working families, while shifting toward more full school-day slots.
In total, the budget cutbacks amounted to around $60 million.
To save money this year, state lawmakers also capped enrollment in the separate Transition to Kindergarten program.
Meanwhile, the state program’s federal counterpart has faced months of Trump administration efforts to dismantle Head Start, which serves roughly 15,000 kids in Washington. And the government shutdown threatened federal funding for programs that serve more than 3,100 Head Start students in Washington, and led to cutbacks across the country.
The Ballmers give millions every year to various causes in Washington, many of which focus on education.
In 2023, the Ballmers gave $38 million to the University of Washington for scholarships to study early childhood education. At the time, the university said the money would provide more than 1,500 scholarships over the ensuing eight years.

Months after state watchdogs reported that health care spending once again blazed past the target for affordability, the Health Policy Commission convened the usual cavalcade of policymakers, analysts, providers, and insurers on Wednesday to survey the landscape and ponder steps Massachusetts can take. 
Speaker after speaker at the day-long cost trends hearing landed on a similar conclusion: The state’s long-standing health care problems will only grow more dire thanks to funding cuts and eligibility changes enacted by the Trump administration. 
Attorney General Andrea Campbell, who has repeatedly challenged the federal government in court, warned that “business as usual is not working” on the health care front. 
“It may mean we have to exercise some courage, be a little bit more bold, take a few more risks, revisit the benchmarks,” Campbell said. 
Elected officials will have their hands full charting a state response to the massive changes coming through the federal reconciliation package, a law supporters dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
About 300,000 Bay Staters are expected to lose coverage through MassHealth, the state Medicaid program, or the Massachusetts Health Connector marketplace over the next decade, according to state data cited by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation president Audrey Shelto. 
Once the myriad provisions in the law fully take effect, Massachusetts will lose about $3.5 billion annually in federal health care funding — more than a quarter of the $12.3 billion the state receives from Washington today for health care, Shelto said. 
“The state is going to have to make some really, really hard decisions. This is not a number that they can make up,” Shelto said. “Some of the decisions are going to also have to be: Who gets covered? What do they get for coverage? What do providers get paid?” 
Under the new federal law, some lawfully present immigrants — about 2,500 in Massachusetts, according to Shelto — will lose eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 
Many other potential enrollees will face work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and will need to prove that they remain eligible every six months, twice as often as current policy. Shelto said those two changes together are projected to “double the rate of uninsurance in Massachusetts.” 
She stressed that impacts will bleed out to all Bay Staters, not just those who might lose heavily subsidized health insurance. If funding cuts cause providers to stop offering services or to scale back staffing, Shelto said, “it’s not going to matter if you’re receiving MassHealth as your insurance or if you have Blue Cross Blue Shield or Point32 or anyone else — that place is not going to be available to you.” 
On top of those changes, more than 300,000 residents face higher premiums starting in 2026 for insurance they get through the Health Connector because of expiring federal tax credits. 
Democrats in Congress have been pushing to extend those subsidies beyond their end-of-year sunset, making the topic a central focus during the record-breaking government shutdown, but it appears unlikely they will be able to get enough Republicans on board. 
“We may be able to turn this crisis into an opportunity,” Shelto said of the combined federal impacts. “We may be bold enough to do things that we wouldn’t go near before because they were just too hard. But the urgency and the potential devastation here is just so imperative for us to really do that.” 
Deep fissures in the state’s health care system had been apparent long before passage of the reconciliation package or agreement on a deal to reopen the government without extension of the subsidies. 
Take the assessment Sen. Cindy Friedman, the Senate’s point person on health care, delivered in March, nearly four months before Trump signed the megalaw: “We hear about a system in crisis,” she said at the time. “We’re beyond that. It is now falling apart.” 
“We’re seeing all of these issues being exacerbated by the federal administration, not just because they’re seeking to take resources away, but [also because of] the chaos and the confusion,” Campbell told reporters Wednesday. “You don’t know at times what their policy is, or you’re learning it 24 hours before it’s supposed to take effect, and then we’re in court trying to protect Massachusetts residents.” 
Total health care spending in Massachusetts grew 8.6 percent from 2022 to 2023, far above the 3.6 percent benchmark that represents the state’s cost-containment goal, driven in part by higher spending on pharmaceuticals and specialty care. 
The trend has saddled many employers and households with higher costs, too. Premiums for small businesses will increase by an average of 11.5 percent in 2026. The Center for Health Information and Analysis said in March that more than two in five Massachusetts residents struggled to afford health care in some way over the past year. 
Neil Abramson, the owner of ECi consignment stores, said the squeeze is being felt in both directions. “Businesses like ours and our employees are spending more and getting less from their health care,” he added. 
Other attendees also warned of a dire state on the front lines.  
New England Medical Association president Dr. Ellana Stinson said she’s observing more and more patients unable to afford basic medications. Liliana Patino, senior director of community impact and development for Eliot Community Human Services, said community agencies are “overwhelmed” trying to translate complex policy changes into language that people can understand. And Dr. Katherine Gergen Barnett, the vice chair of primary care innovation and transformation at Boston Medical Center, said the ability to provide high-quality care faces “grave danger.” 
Gergen Barnett called on policymakers to devote significant attention and new resources toward primary care, an area where provider burnout and comparatively low investment are making it harder for residents to get appointments. 
In 2021, only about 8 percent of all commercial health care dollars in Massachusetts went to primary care. Some policymakers are beginning to coalesce around the idea of mandating a higher share of funding for primary care, which could draw resources away from other areas. 
For her part, Gergen Barnett suggested Massachusetts direct 10 percent to 12 percent of health care dollars toward primary care. 
“This is not business as usual,” she said. “Primary care and the health of Massachusetts depend on urgent action.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10_28_SNAP_rally_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

(Screenshot). A message by the Billings Outlaws of the Arena Football One league says the team, which won the last ArenaBowl, will go dormant for the 2026 season, placing much of the blame on the fans and the civic leaders of Montana’s “Magic City.”
Montana has no other professional indoor football teams.
The Billings Outlaws had won the ArenaBowl XXXIII championship, defeating the Albany Firebirds 46-41 on July 19, 2024, in a nationally televised game on CBS Sports Network.
The announcement said that the team will “go dormant” for a year to find its future home. An article published by KULR TV in Billings also listed a realtor as taking ownership offers.
However, the team laid the problems at the feet of fans and local politicians in a statement:
“Due to an increase in costs, the lack of any municipal or state government support, and the simple fact that even with $10 tickets in Billings, we couldn’t fill TDS Fiber Field for nationally televised games, it is apparent that the Outlaws being in Billings isn’t longer feasible for the team.”
The Outlaws compete in Arena Football One and played at the MetraPark complex in Billings. They were founded in 2022 and became the third indoor football team to call Montana’s largest city home. Another team, the Billings Outlaws, played from 2000 through 2010 there, while the Billings Wolves competed in 2015-2016.
The Billings Gazette reported in May that the ownership group, which was led by Wyoming attorney Steven Titus, was considering moving the team, which was accompanied by a decision to drop the name “Billings” from the team title.
The Billings Outlaws franchise finishes with a total of 24 wins and 10 losses. Eight teams remain in the Arena Football One, with Titus serving as its chairman. The two nearest teams are the Washington Wolfpack, located in Everett, Washington, or the Oregon Lightning, located in Redmond, Oregon.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Billings-Outlaws-homepage-1024x633.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

Jean Leising comes out against early redistricting,Leslie Bonilla Muñiz,,,,,https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/briefs/indiana-gop-sen-jean-leising-comes-out-against-early-redistricting/,"Leising cited constituent opposition. She also criticized national pro-redistricting groups' ""completely unacceptable"" methods.","Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, defends a farmland ownership bill in the Senate Chamber on March 4, 2024. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Longtime Indiana Sen. Jean Leising on Wednesday announced she “will vote NO” on early congressional map changes, citing constituent opposition.
“I have heard from hundreds of constituents on this matter in the past two months, and they are overwhelmingly opposed to mid-cycle congressional redistricting — with only 6% supporting new districts,” Leising, R-Oldenburg, said in a written statement.
She joins five other Senate Republicans to publicly pan plans to reconfigure congressional maps created just four years ago. Thirteen have come out in support, but more than half of the 40-member caucus haven’t made their stances known publicly.
Indiana lawmakers will meet in December to consider creating more GOP U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by President Donald Trump’s administration and his supporters.
Author of 2021 congressional map now on board for mid-cycle redistricting

Indiana’s current map advantages Republicans 7-2, but proponents are gunning for a 9-0 version. Boundaries are typically adjusted every 10 years using new census data.
“Washington, D.C.-funded organizations in favor of redistricting are using extremely negative texts, videos and phone calls to try to win support for their cause,” Leising said.
“Some have even been sent via cell phone to students in my district, including my 14-year-old grandson,” she continued. “These groups do not have the best interest of my rural area or the state of Indiana at heart, and their methods are completely unacceptable. I have never supported negative campaigning.”
One influential Washington, D.C. group on Wednesday began airing another round of pro-redistricting TV ads in Indiana.
Also Wednesday, an Indiana-based organization with ties to Trump’s presidential campaigns launched a six-figure advertising effort targeting undeclared Republican members of the Indiana Senate. There’s more focus on that chamber because the Senate GOP’s caucus leader has repeatedly said the votes “aren’t there.” His counterpart in the Hosue has confirmed enough support to pass new maps.
Leising also called it “discouraging that we are being asked to vote for a map that we have never seen,” adding, “I would never vote YES on a bill that I did not know the contents of.” She hoped her constituents would understand “that we should not vote YES on completely unknown changes.”
“I will be listening to my constituents and will vote NO if there is a vote,” she concluded.
The longtime lawmaker has served in the Senate since 2008, as well as 1988-1996. She represents Decatur, Fayette, Ripley and Rush counties in southeast Indiana, along with portions of Franklin, Jennings and Shelby counties.
Leising is a retired nurse who works as a travel agent and farmer, according to her legislative biography. She lives on her farm in Oldenburg, and has three grown children and eight grandchildren.

Conservation groups say Taylor, like Asha, is probably roaming to find a mate. (Aislinn Maestas, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Conservation groups this week criticized New Mexico wildlife officials for the recent capture and relocation of “Taylor,” a wandering male Mexican gray wolf, back to a protected zone in the Gila National Forest.
The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish caught Taylor on Nov. 7 near Gallina, a small, unincorporated community in Rio Arriba County. He was captured by helicopter and returned to the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, which includes most of the state below I-40. 
According to a statement from the Department of Game and Fish, Taylor first ventured north of the interstate in mid-July and was relocated. Such wandering away from an established pack is known as dispersal. Since late October, Taylor “has made significant movements to the north, showing no signs of returning to the” experimental population area.
“Dispersal events like this often occur when a wolf is in search of a mate,” the department stated. “As there are no other known Mexican wolves in the area, there was a potential risk of mortality as well as a likelihood of a negative interaction or breeding with domestic dogs.”
However, several conservation organizations have condemned the department’s decision to relocate Taylor for a second time to stay within government-set boundaries, which they describe as “arbitrary.” Their statement also notes that conservation groups named the wolf Taylor after Mount Taylor, where he was first encountered in May 2025. The peak is located near Grants, north of I-40. Moreover, a joint news release from several conservation groups notes, Taylor’s movements indicate he might be looking for a mate as the breeding season for the species begins in January.
“It’s ridiculous to keep moving wolves back south of Interstate 40 when wolves have clearly decided there’s great habitat to the north of the highway,” Greta Anderson, deputy director of Western Watersheds Project, said in a statement. “We fully expect that, like Asha before him, he’ll head right back to his northern territory. We can’t explain his desire, but we shouldn’t deny his instincts.” 
Asha, a female Mexican gray wolf, wandered north of I-40 in New Mexico several times. She was recently released from captivity in August to the Gila National Forest with her mate and pups. Another female gray wolf, known as Ella, was found dead in April this year soon after she was also spotted near Grants. At the time, Sally Paez, staff attorney for New Mexico Wild, told Source New Mexico that it was “exciting” to see these endangered wolves traveling into parts of the state that could offer “suitable wolf habitat” and “good wildlife corridors.”

Conservation organizations added that there have been two other wolves to wander too far north in recent years, making Taylor the fifth wolf in recent years to wander north. They also emphasized that Taylor’s wandering did not lead to any conflict with humans these last several months.
“We’ve long known that the political boundaries imposed on Mexican gray wolf recovery do not match ecological ones, and that this poses a significant hindrance to recovery,” Luke Koenig, Gila grassroots organizer for New Mexico Wild, said in a statement this week. “We have an opportunity here to advance recovery efforts by simply allowing Taylor—and other lobos—to wander north into historic and suitable habitat, and yet we expend significant resources time and time again preventing just that.”
According to the Grand Canyon Wolf Recovery Project, a nonprofit organization working to restoring wolves and ecological health in the Grand Canyon area, Mexican wolf dispersal and reintroduction into northern New Mexico and southern Colorado would contribute to the animal’s long-term recovery and provide opportunities for interbreeding and genetic diversity.
“Taylor knows where he belongs,” Claire Musser, executive director of the Grand Canyon Wolf Recovery Project, said in a statement. “Wolves like him are showing us what real recovery looks like, not confined by arbitrary lines, but led by instinct, resilience and the search for connection.If we truly care about their survival, we must let lobos lead.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ashawolf-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 16:57:13.075866

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Board of Regents tossed around potential bylaws and metrics for measuring success of the University of Iowa’s new center for intellectual freedom during its Wednesday meeting as the center’s overseers prepare for the program’s launch.
Multiple regents suggested changes to bylaws presented to the board for the first time Wednesday by interim center director Luciano de Castro. Among the top concerns was staving off potential out-of-state control, prompted by proposed rules as to the tenure status of committee members.
Regent and advisory council chair Christine Hensley said the legislation requiring the center’s formation is “vague” in some areas.
“We, after having conversations with legal counsel and staff, determined that the best approach for the bylaws would be to keep them simple, and maybe understanding also that we would maybe miss or not address every single thing,” Hensley said. “So this is the start.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Included in the bylaws in their current form are the center’s purpose and mission and rules for committee membership, duties, course and certification offerings and more. The center “shall educate students by means of free, open, and rigorous intellectual inquiry to seek the truth,” according to the bylaws, and it “affirms the value of intellectual diversity in higher education and aspires to enhance the intellectual diversity of the University.”
De Castro also recognized in the bylaws the center’s responsibilities to instill in students necessary mental skills and habits to “reach their own informed conclusions on matters and political importance” and to facilitate a community that respects intellectual freedom, differences of opinion and people’s individual abilities to work and grow.
The center’s advisory council will oversee the nationwide search for a director, according to the bylaws, in addition to advising the director and board of regents on topics impacting the center and overseeing center operations. No council members are eligible for the director job.
Meetings of the advisory council must occur at least once every semester, the bylaws stated, and it is bound by state open records laws.
Two committees will be formed from the council membership, split between executive and scholarly duties. A majority of executive committee members must be current or former tenured professors from an R1 research institution, according to the bylaws, and every scholar committee member must meet those criteria.
Regent Nancy Dunkel’s concerns about out-of-state control of the center lingered Wednesday, with her asking Hensley who on the advisory council would be excluded from committee appointments and how many of them are Iowans.
Regent Robert Cramer proposed striking the language in the bylaws referring to executive committee membership requirements for tenure, which Dunkel agreed with and said similar language relating to the scholar committee should also be struck.
“I’m hoping that we have, and can maintain, Iowa control,” Dunkel said.
The executive committee will manage the search for a director and handle materials and minutes for the full advisory council, as well as advise the council chair on the center and its activities. The scholar committee will advise the center director on hiring, promotion and tenure of faculty involved in the center and other academic matters.
Ad hoc committees can be created by the advisory council, according to the bylaws, or by the center director for the purpose of reviewing faculty for tenure. The director has “sole and exclusive authority” to hire support staff and faculty, from temporary or part-time to tenured professors, as well as bring in visiting teachers and speakers. He also sets “the responsibilities and compensation” for center employees.
The advisory council’s first meeting is scheduled for Nov. 18, Hensley said, and an inaugural center event is being planned for early December.
Dunkel also wanted to know how success was going to be measured at the center. Hensley indicated state lawmakers, who ordered the creation of the program, would be a key part of judging its value.
“We are required to give an annual report to the Legislature outlining what has all transpired, and to be perfectly honest, I think that annual report will be really key,” Hensley said. “And if you continue to receive state appropriations for the center, I think that would be a concurrence, if they agree with the work moving forward.”
Dunkel asked if Hensley was saying that the center making money would be a measure of success. Hensley disagreed but reiterated that they’ll measure success “based on the annual report.”
Cramer said he thinks the center’s goal is “to raise the level of civic, both knowledge and engagement, by our students, by bringing in speakers and by offering these classes, but then also with the long-term intent of … adding more debate to our campus, where people of different sides can view different opinions, and we can let the students grapple with those things.”
De Castro and others have been working hard over the past month or so, Hensley said, getting bylaws ready and contracting with a firm to conduct a market study. He has also started contacting potential speakers to visit the center and is  developing two courses to be offered in the spring semester.
“To be perfectly honest, we are way beyond what was outlined in the legislation,” Hensley said.

Both legislators are working a bill to modify funding for higher education that is tied to outcomes. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The chairs of the Alabama Legislature’s education budget committees are drafting legislation that could change the funding mechanisms for higher education.
Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee chair Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, said after a hearing on the proposal before the Joint Modernizing Higher Education Funding Committee on Wednesday that they were working on criteria for the model, aimed at linking some public funding to education outcomes.
As a model, Orr cited the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) Act, passed earlier this year, which allocates more money to K-12 schools to help educate certain classes of students, such as English Language Learners and students in poverty.

“With each institution, how can we help you, emphasis on help, improve your outcomes,” Orr said. “One that the Legislature would like to see –- and I am filling in a blank — would be jobs that the state of Alabama needs. One of them is educators or teachers, one is nurses or more qualified people in health care. We need more lab technicians, who are going to be junior colleges and not universities. What are the needs that our state has, and how can we help you with additional funds to increase your numbers for those particular outputs.”
Orr said that the model would apply to two-year colleges, regional institutions of higher education as well as universities engaged in research. The model would be tailored to each of the three categories.
Orr said that the portion of the funding that is tied to outcomes will be in addition to the total that states already receive for their operations and expenses. About 30% of the funds allocated to implement the RAISE Act, he said, were intended for higher education
The senator’s comments came after a series of presentations to members of the education budget committees on how outcomes-based funding works in other states.
Consultants with ExcelinEd, a national nonprofit founded by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a Republican, that focuses on education policy told lawmakers Wednesday that lawmakers should tie funding to their priorities for higher education and allocate additional money for students with additional needs.
Matthew Joseph, senior policy advisor for education funding with ExcelinEd, said the model must provide sufficient funding, right outcomes and some focus on higher need students to be a success. Kentucky, he said, saw “an immediate impact” from adopting the guidelines.
“If you looked at their graduation rates in the last 10 years, what you see is their growth just stalled, it just wasn’t growing very much,” he said. “Then they fine-tuned, upgraded their outcomes-based funding, and they saw a significant boost in their graduation rates, 50% higher change from year to year, over the last five years.”
Metrics could include attainment goals or ones geared toward a particular priority of the state, such as workforce goals.
House Ways and Means Education Chair Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, kept repeating workforce development as an issue, particularly Alabama’s lower labor force participation rate.
“We just created the Department of Workforce,” he said during the meeting. “We have the lowest labor force participation rate in the country, and so we are trying to focus on connecting with the business community and the consumer to find out what our job needs to be. I believe the universities need to be part of that.”
Jim Purcell, executive director of the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, said in a statement that colleges and universities must have flexibility to offer courses, “include those in the humanities and liberal arts, which are essential to developing critical thinking and civic engagement.”
“The key will be balance and ensuring that policy encourages responsiveness to workforce needs while preserving the full educational mission and integrity of Alabama’s colleges and universities,” the statement said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Arthur-Orr-Danny-Garrett-Feb-5-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 15:57:17.553093

Nov. 12, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. The House Health Policy Committee heard testimony on Wednesday on a package of bills that seeks to introduce reporting requirements for abortions that providers would have to meet. 
“These bills would bring Michigan in line with most of the other states and with the data that is currently being collected federally,” said Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy), the sponsor of one of the bills in the package. “This is a no nonsense step to protect women.”
The bills would require reporting of 19 different pieces of information for each abortion. Those include demographic information, like age and marital status, as well as information about the abortion itself, including the method of abortion, method of payment, and “whether the fetus showed evidence of life” when the abortion took place. It further requires reporting of why the abortion was sought out, as well as any complications that occurred due to the abortion. 
“In this state, we have a lot of abortions that are occurring, and this legislation is designed to give us data around these procedures, to inform us to support women in these challenging times, to try to come up with policy to decrease the amount of abortions that are happening in this state,” said Rep. Brad Paquette (R-Niles), whose bill establishes the reporting requirements themselves. 
The package also includes legislation to criminalize the disclosure of the personal information of those receiving abortions, introduced by Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Shelbyville). Though the information collected under these bills would not include personally identifiable information, this would prevent any of that information being disclosed. 
“It’s hard to make an informed decision too, if, as a woman,” Smit said, “you don’t have any of these measures to look at.” 
Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) seemed to express some trepidation, while asking questions of presenters from Right to Life of Michigan and other anti-abortion groups, about the amount of information that would be collected under this bill, questioning how information on marital status would be relevant to understanding risks and complications. 
“I understand the desire here, and I understand the need for informed consumers,” Tisdel said. “I don’t want to be creating policy simply because we don’t like something.”
Rebecca Mastee, a policy advocate for the Michigan Catholic Conference, responded that the bill only sought to return reporting requirements to what they were prior to changes to law that went into effect after the 2022 ballot measure that enshrined abortion rights into the Michigan Constitution. 
Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, added that the details could be used to drive public policy if certain demographic groups were overrepresented in abortion statistics. 
“It restores common sense laws, which Michigan had for over 40 years and which bring needed transparency to the abortion industry,” Marnon said. 
However, Dr. Katherine Starr, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan, stated in submitted written testimony in opposition to the bills, that together, they sought to “single out abortion care from all other kinds of health care, impose medically unnecessary administrative burdens, and force providers to interrogate patients so they can deliver deeply personal and highly sensitive patient information to the state.”
Michigan had previously published reports annually with detailed statistics on abortions, including demographic data and information on complications, but those ceased after a 2023 law change. 
45 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have some kind of reporting requirement, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. The requirements in these bills would be among the most detailed, with just seven states requiring data on method of payment and 10 states requiring information on the viability of the fetus. 
“Any vote against these bills is a vote against women’s safety,” said Ariane Fisher, the director of community outreach for a Catholic pregnancy resource center in Southfield, Mich.  
In contrast, Starr noted that many patients are already fearful about protecting their privacy, which could impact their care.
“Being asked to disclose where they live, their age, their marital status, and why they are seeking care, knowing that this information will be shared with the state, could further deter people from seeking care and insert more fear into what may already be a very difficult situation,” Starr said.

Patrick Morrisey has established a committee that will oversee putting a statue of West Virginia World War II hero Woody Williams at the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. 
Morrisey established the Hershel “Woody” Williams Statue Commission Tuesday by executive order. 
The Williams’ statue will replace a statue of John E. Kenna in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the U.S. Capitol. Kenna was a Confederate soldier, Kanawha County prosecutor and circuit judge and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. His statue has been at the Capitol since 1901. 
State lawmakers passed a resolution during a special legislative session in October 2024 that the state should replace the Kenna statue with one of Williams. According to the resolution, Kenna’s statue will be moved to the state Culture Center for display.
Williams, of Marion County, was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroic acts as a Marine in the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II and was the nation’s last surviving medal of honor recipient from World War II.
Williams also established the Gold Star Families Memorial Monument program, which honors the families of fallen service members. He died in 2022. 
According to Morrisey’s executive order, the commission will consist of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby, the deputy tourism secretary, and the following officials or their designees: the governor, the secretary of Veteran’s Assistance, Senate President Randy Smith, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, minority leaders of the House and Senate, the director of the state purchasing division and 12 members of the public that Morrisey will appoint. 
Funding for the design and creation of the statue will come from the Governor’s Contingency Fund, according to the resolution. 
The executive order does not include a timeline for appointing the remaining members of the public or of placing the statue.

At least 36 states have crafted subsidies specifically for data center projects, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit watchdog group that tracks economic development incentives. But only 11 of those states — Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — disclose which companies receive those incentives.
Lawmakers fear AI data centers will drive up residents’ power bills

In a new study, the organization examined a lack of transparency in data center deals, which are proliferating across the country as technology demands increase.  
Despite data centers’ significant energy requirements, states frequently compete heavily to land the projects, which invest millions or even billions into new construction. But the study noted those projects often employ nondisclosure agreements, project code names and subsidiary names that hide the firms behind the new server farms.
“Only when governments disclose information on which companies get public money and what they do with it can there be meaningful analysis, greater public participation, and wiser use of public financial resources,” the report says.
Good Jobs First specifically examined sales and use tax exemptions that benefit data centers. The study does not account for local property tax abatements, corporate income tax credits and discounts on electricity and water rates.
Virginia, the largest data center market in the world, forgoes nearly $1 billion in state and local sales and use tax revenue each year without telling the public which companies benefit or how much they receive, the study said.
Good Jobs First underscored state calculations that show data center subsidies do not provide a return on taxpayer investments. It recommends states eliminate or curtail data center subsidies. “At the very least, states should practice full transparency,” the report said.
Good Jobs First says states must reassess their investments in data centers with federal cuts looming that will strain state finances.

Montana inmates were again experiencing problems with water this week.
This time, though, it wasn’t in Deer Lodge and the solution didn’t take weeks.
Family members and inmates reported on Tuesday morning the hot water in a private prison in Mississippi had been out, with no communication on how long it would last.
Core Civic, the private-prison operator which contracts with the State of Montana and runs facilities in several locations, says that hot water has been restored to its Tutwiler, Mississippi facility after just 24 hours. The State of Montana contracts with Core Civic to house male inmates at the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility.
This isn’t the first water issue for MT inmates this fall. For several weeks in October, crews worked around the clock and the Montana National Guard was called in to help solve water supply issues to the Department of Correction’s largest facility, the Montana State Prison, in Deer Lodge. Those problems have recently been resolved and water there has been flowing normally and has been tested as safe, according to Montana Department of Corrections Officials.  
A spokesperson for the company said the problem was reported, addressed and corrected all within a day. Ryan Gustin, Senior Director for Public Affairs released this statement after the Daily Montanan inquired about the situation:


“The safety, health and well-being of those in our care and the staff at all our facilities, including Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility (TCCF), is our top priority. Earlier today, TCCF facility staff were made aware of an issue related to a lack of hot water, which was affecting several housing units. The maintenance staff at TCCF quickly isolated an issue with one of the facility boilers. They were able to address this issue within a short period of time and all hot water to the facility has been restored. At no point did the issue with the boiler impact the facility heat. It’s important to note that at all our facilities, including TCCF, we have contingency plans in place to address issues such as this if the repair were to take longer than expected.
“TCCF staff conduct inspections on all housing units, at least once per shift, to monitor for any maintenance-related issues. If any issue related to the physical plant is observed, a maintenance work order is generated immediately. Maintenance work orders are typically resolved within 24 hours, as was the case here.”
 
Officials with the Montana Department of Corrections confirmed the situation on Wednesday and said they’re also monitoring the situation in Mississippi.
As of Wednesday, the department’s dashboard showed 239 inmates from Montana housed at that facility. Montana can send a maximum of 240 inmates there. Currently, Montana has 3,356 inmates housed throughout its different facilities.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tallahatchie-front-entrance-1024x985.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 15:57:17.553093

The Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.



The No Kings protests in October, which drew over seven million people across the country, were hailed as the largest demonstrations in American history. Now the question for many people is: What works to stop authoritarianism?
Maria Stephan has been studying this question. Her award-winning book, “Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict,” co-authored with Erica Chenoweth of Harvard, examines a century of resistance movements around the world. They determined that nonviolent protests are more than twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts. Chenoweth went on to coin the widely cited 3.5% Rule, which states that when 3.5% of the population protest nonviolently, the movement will win. 
“When you have 3.5% of a population, which in the United States is roughly 12 million people, that means a movement is representative. It’s hard to ignore. It’s highly disruptive. And behind those 3.5% are many, many more people who support the aims of the movement,” Stephan told The Vermont Conversation.
Maria Stephan was a strategic planner with the U.S. Department of State and founded and directed the Program on Nonviolent Action at the U.S. Institute of Peace. She is the author and editor of five books on authoritarianism and civil resistance. She was born and raised in Vermont and currently lives in New York City, where she is chief organizer with the Horizons Project, which she describes as “building a strong pro-democracy front that brings people together from different parts of society to effectively counter authoritarianism in the U.S.” 
Stephan highlighted the many tactics of the movement against authoritarianism. “We know from studying nonviolent resistance campaigns against authoritarian regimes around the world that it’s the organized acts of non-cooperation — when people withhold their consumer buying power, when workers withhold labor, when security forces refuse to use repression vis a vis peaceful protesters — these acts of non-cooperation are what is really key to the success of pro-democracy movements, and we’re seeing this across the country.”
She cited examples of “people taking courageous stands both as individuals and collectively.” These include “the powerful image of the Idaho teacher, Sarah Inama, who refused to take down the sign ‘Everyone is Welcome Here’ in her classroom, which resulted in the whole community mobilizing in support of inclusive classrooms.”
There was Rachel Cohen, “the young lawyer who left her law firm after it capitulated to Trump. She not only left the firm, she organized thousands of lawyers to similarly commit to not be part of firms that engage in that type of capitulation.” 
Stephan said that in the higher education sector, “seven out of nine universities have refused a higher education compact offered by the Trump administration that would have offered access to federal funding in exchange for various forms of censorship on campus.” And the World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers, she said, refused ICE agents access to their grounds to coordinate arrests of immigrants and undocumented people.
“For all these reasons and all the powerful, joyful, creative acts of defiance and community care I’m seeing across the country. I believe we will prevail.”

Vendors had 72 hours following the Nov. 3 announcement to notify the state of their intent to challenge the decision.The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis has announced its intent to award a multibillion-dollar Medicaid managed-care contract for medically complex children to Molina Healthcare of Florida.
The decision, announced earlier this month, is not final and can be challenged. Vendors had 72 hours following the Nov. 3 announcement to notify the state of their intent to challenge the decision. 
Thereafter, statutes provide vendors an additional 10 days to file formal written protests with the state.
The Agency for Health Care Administration did not immediately say whether it had received any protest notices.
But Sunshine Health, the wholly owned subsidiary of Centene Health, won’t be challenging “at this time” and attributed the decision to “concerns related to terms contained in the final version of the state’s [invitation to negotiate] that we were not able to agree to.”
The company did not elaborate on what those concerns were.
 “Having served this program statewide, we have a deep understanding of the level of service and care the children who rely on this program need,” the statement read. “In evaluating the state’s proposed terms, our understanding of this population informed our consideration of multiple key factors, including whether the terms align with our mission of transforming the communities we serve, are sustainable for us as an organization, and will ultimately enable Sunshine to provide our members the quality care they deserve.”

Centene is the health care company that negotiated a Medicaid settlement with the state that resulted in $10 million being sent to the nonprofit foundation associated with Hope Florida, an initiative pushed by First Lady Casey DeSantis designed to help people move off of government assistance programs.
Health care giant Centene writes a $10M check to Hope Florida Foundation

The Hope Florida Foundation wound up sending millions to two groups that then steered money to an effort to defeat a ballot proposal on marijuana. The arrangement triggered a probe by the Florida House and has led to a grand jury investigation, according to several published reports. Centene has said previously that the Agency for Health Care Administration directed the terms of the settlement.
The ITN vendors were asked to bid on does contain a section on Hope Florida and a requirement that the winning health plan coordinate with the program to help “graduate” people from Medicaid and Florida KidCare. 
Rising enrollment, payments
The CMS managed-care plan is for medically complex children living in lower income households, whether they qualify for Medicaid or Florida KidCare, the state’s version of the children’s health insurance program. Children enrolled in KidCare pay monthly premiums for the coverage whereas Medicaid-eligible children don’t.
The new contract will expire Dec. 31, 2030, and cannot be renewed but can be extended if necessary to cover any delays during the transition to a new contract. There is no guaranteed payment; the contract notes payment is “contingent upon availability of funds.” 
But a review of Medicaid data shows state economists anticipate increases in the number of medically complex children enrolling in the managed-care network and hikes in the payments to the health plan for treating the children.
Florida’s top economists predict enrollment in the plan will climb from an anticipated 113,171 children this year to 120,277 by June 2030. The state’s monthly managed-care payments are expected to increase from about $4,555 per member per month to more than $5,400 per member per month by June 30, 2030.
Molina Healthcare of Florida is under contract for another Medicaid managed-care program to provide health care services in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. While the CMS managed-care program caters to medically complex children, the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Program provides services to a more traditional Medicaid population.

The completion last month of the two-year-long, $31.6 million cleanup effort at the USS Yorktown averts the potential of the aging battleship-turned-maritime-museum springing a toxic leak.
“The USS Yorktown was a ticking environmental time bomb, with the risk of disaster increasing each year, and now it has been safely and successfully defused,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement Wednesday celebrating the project’s success.

“Had these materials leaked, they would have caused catastrophic damage to Charleston Harbor, destroying marshes and estuaries, killing marine life, and threatening industries that support thousands of jobs across the Lowcountry,” McMaster added. “Instead, we took action to prevent that disaster and protect South Carolina.”
The USS Yorktown came to South Carolina in 1975. The ship, built in 1943 to replace the original Yorktown sunk by a Japanese submarine in the Battle of Midway, saw tours in both World War II and the Vietnam War. At its peak, 3,300 sailors manned the 820-foot vessel, which is now a national historic landmark that welcomes some 300,000 visitors annually.
When the United States military decommissioned and gifted the ship to the Palmetto State, however, it did so on an as-is basis.
The fuel and oil that had once kept the ship running remained on board for decades. After nearly 50 years mired in pluff mud, the ship’s outer hull began to corrode, posing a serious risk to the state’s pristine beaches and $29 million tourism industry.
Using federal COVID-19 pandemic relief funds, the state brought in contractors in the fall of 2023 who pumped out nearly 600,000 gallons of oily water and 9 tons of sludge from a portion of the ship’s 428 liquid storage tanks and removed 4.5 tons of asbestos. Divers also patched 35 holes in the ship’s hull.
Then, in a second phase that began in February, workers from HEPACO LLC, Shipwright, Inc., and Isla Maritime pulled out the remaining 1.4 million gallons of fuel and oil, as well as 9 tons of asbestos insulation.
Crews added back freshwater to the now clean tanks to ensure the Yorktown remains stable.
The former warship has become the crown jewel of the state-owned Patriot’s Point Naval and Maritime Museum visited by 300,000 tourists each year.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey NAACP and two Latino groups sued state insurance regulators Wednesday, alleging they improperly allowed insurers to use proxies for income and race when setting car insurance rates.
In their suit, the NAACP, Latino Action Network, and Latino Coalition of New Jersey argue that the use of income proxies like education and occupation allows insurers to skirt restrictions and raise rates for low-income and Black or Latino drivers, regardless of their actual risk.
“A person’s degree or job title should not determine what they pay to drive. These so-called risk factors are thinly veiled discrimination that keeps communities at a disadvantage,” state NAACP President Richard Smith said in a statement.
Consumer advocacy groups have long sought to outlaw the use of income proxies in car insurance rate setting, though they’ve found little success nearly two decades into the fight.
Those groups argue factors like education and occupation raise insurance rates for good drivers who are low income, and investigations have shown car insurance rates are higher in neighborhoods with majority non-white populations, even when accident costs are similar.
The suit charges that by allowing insurers to consider occupation and education in rate-setting, regulators violated state anti-discrimination protections, constitutional equal protection guarantees, and state law barring discrimination in insurance rates.
They asked a judge to declare the use of income proxies in insurance rate setting unconstitutional.
“After decades of meetings and appeals without meaningful change, the courts are now the only path to accountability. This case challenges a system that punishes people for who they are instead of how they drive,” said Alex Shalom, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys.
New Jersey’s insurance regulators have long denied that the use of education and occupation data systematically boosts rates for residents with lower educational or occupational attainment, arguing those factors are simply among the many used to set rates.
In a 2008 report on the use of occupational and educational factors in car insurance, the state Department of Banking and Insurance found they had not pushed overall premiums higher for such consumers.
The report says rates proffered by Geico, which was then pioneering the practice in New Jersey, were often lower than rates of competing insurers who did not weigh a driver’s occupation or education.
Higher accident and moving violation rates in dense urban areas, where Black and Latino New Jerseyans are likelier to live and where incomes tend to be lower, could explain part of the difference, according to the report.
Research from Consumer Reports Digital Lab found lower-ranked, lower-educated New Jersey workers typically paid more for car insurance than higher-ranked, higher-educated counterparts, though the trend did not always hold true.
Not all New Jersey car insurers inquire about a prospective customer’s job or education levels.
At least five states — California, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and New York — bar the use of educational and job attainment in car insurance rate setting.
New Jersey lawmakers have weighed outlawing the use of proxies like occupation and education, but those efforts have been hard fought and ended with the law unchanged.
In 2021, the Senate narrowly approved legislation that would have barred car insurers from using a customer’s profession, education level, marital status, and credit score, among some other factors, in rate setting, but the bill did not advance in the Assembly.
Successor bills reintroduced in more recent legislative sessions have not moved at all.

Betsy Segui, a former New Haven sergeant who supervised the city police station lockup, pleaded guilty to second-degree reckless endangerment in exchange for a 60-day suspended jail term. Another former officer, Ronald Pressley, took the same plea deal and received an identical sentence last week.
Cox, 39, who did not attend the New Haven Superior Court hearing, was left paralyzed from the chest down on June 19, 2022, when the police van he was riding in without a seat belt braked hard, sending him head-first into a metal partition while his hands were cuffed behind his back. He had been arrested on charges of threatening a woman with a gun, which were later dismissed.
“I can’t move. I’m going to die like this. Please, please, please help me,” Cox said in the van minutes after the crash, according to police video. He later was found to have broken his neck.
Once at the police station, officers mocked Cox and accused him of being drunk and faking his injuries, according to surveillance and body-worn camera footage. Officers dragged Cox out of the van and around the police station before placing him in a holding cell before his eventual transfer to a hospital.
When Cox told the officers that he thought he had cracked his neck, Segui responded, “You ain’t crack nothing. You just drank too much,” according to an internal affairs investigation report.
Segui did not speak about Cox’s treatment during the court hearing. She only answered standard questions from the judge about her guilty plea.
Her lawyer, Gregory Cerritelli, said Segui wanted to put the criminal case behind her.
“She’s no longer working in law enforcement and has no desire to, so I think from her perspective this just gives her closure and lets her move on with her life and focus on her new career,” he said in an interview after the hearing. He declined to say what Segui’s new career is.
Three other officers involved in Cox’s transport, Oscar Diaz, Jocelyn Lavandier and Luis Rivera, rejected plea deals proposed by prosecutors and chose to take their cases to trial. All three are charged with cruelty to persons and reckless endangerment.
Prosecutors said Cox was informed about Segui’s plea deal beforehand and gave his consent. In 2023, the city of New Haven agreed to settle a lawsuit by Cox for $45 million.
Louis Rubano, a lawyer for Cox, said Cox and his family had hoped the criminal cases would end as quickly as possible with plea bargains by all five officers.
“I think bringing a conclusion to this tragic situation is what the family wants, and the fact now that there’s going to be potentially a trial for the other remaining officers forces Randy and his family to have to kind of re-live the events of that tragic day,” Rubano said.
Rubano said Cox has bought a home and is living there with his mother, who is caring for him with the help of medical professionals.
The case drew outrage from civil rights advocates including the NAACP, along with comparisons to the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. Cox is Black, while all five officers who were arrested are Black or Hispanic. Gray, who also was Black, died in 2015 after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van.

(Official legislative photo)The entrance of another Democrat in the race for Maine’s 1st Congressional District has teed up a primary for incumbent U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who is seeking her 10th term.
State Rep. Tiffany Roberts of South Berwick announced last week her plan to run for Maine’s southern district in the November 2026 election. She is the only Democrat currently challenging Pingree, who is seeking her 10th term in the office. The two will face off in a June 9 primary election to determine who will be on the November ballot.
Roberts’ entrance into the race came ahead of a shake-up in the Republican primary, with Sanford Police Chief Eric Small announcing his decision to conclude his run. Instead, he plans on running for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives because he feels he could be more effective in state office. In his announcement, Small backed Republican Ron Russell in his bid to unseat Pingree. 
Russell won the Republican primary for the 2024 election, but ultimately lost to Pingree by 57% to 35%. Federal election records also list Republicans Joshua Duprey and Anthony Piantidosi as candidates.  
At her launch event at the South Berwick Town Hall, Roberts talked about being elected to the Maine House seven years ago, saying she didn’t know at the time what she was getting herself into, but felt people deserved someone who would listen and fight for them. 
“In Maine, showing up still means something,” Roberts said. “It’s how trust is built, how problems get solved, and how progress starts. But let’s be honest. For far too long, government hasn’t been listening. We are tired of being talked at. Tired of promises that sound good but don’t change anything back home.”
Roberts also discussed her grown children who no longer live in the state, though “not for lack of me trying.” Because she doesn’t want other parents to see their children leave to make a decent income, she’s driven to come up with ideas for how to make Maine a place where the next generation can afford to live. 
She said her work chairing the Legislature’s Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business Committee showed her that Maine’s heritage industries need upgrading, while new technologies and markets need to be explored to create jobs for young people.
“This isn’t a campaign against anyone,” Roberts said. “It’s a campaign for something. For Maine’s future. For the next generation. For a government that listens first and acts second. Because the postcard platforms and clickbait talking points have gotten us here — where our kids are leaving, families are priced out, seniors are struggling, and small businesses are tangled in red tape. This campaign is for changing that.”
Roberts said that following the launch event she’d be starting a “Six Counties in Six Weeks” tour, during which she’ll spend a week in each county of the 1st District. She plans to hold town halls, walk shop floors and meet with voters and is asking for volunteers to help with her campaign as well as donations for staffing, field offices and other outreach. 
Roberts didn’t respond to an interview request Wednesday from Maine Morning Star.

Special Legislative Session Set for November 13 to Address State Revenue Concerns and Consider Separation Bill
Delaware Faces Significant Budget Gap as Lawmakers Reconvene
By Brent Burdge, Contributing Journalist, Delaware LIVE
DOVER, Del. — Delaware legislators are scheduled to convene in a special session on November 13, 2025, to address a projected $400 million budget shortfall. The deficit, recently forecasted by the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council (DEFAC), is largely attributed to federal tax changes passed under President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” As the state grapples with potential cuts to essential services, lawmakers are considering urgent measures, including a proposed separation bill that would decouple Delaware’s corporate tax code from recent federal reforms.
Background: Revenue Forecast and Federal Tax Changes
According to DEFAC, state revenues are expected to fall short by approximately $400 million for the upcoming fiscal year. The council cites the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” enacted earlier this year, as a primary factor. The legislation introduced sweeping tax breaks for corporations and high-income individuals, altering federal deductions, exemptions, and taxation structures. Because Delaware’s tax code is partially linked to federal standards, these changes have an immediate and significant impact on state revenue collection.
Impact: Essential State Services at Risk
The anticipated shortfall raises concerns about funding for critical state services. Education budgets, infrastructure improvements, and health care programs could all face reductions if new revenue sources or policy adjustments are not implemented. School districts warn that cuts could lead to larger class sizes and deferred maintenance, while health care advocates fear reduced access to programs serving vulnerable populations. Infrastructure projects, including road and bridge repairs, may also be delayed or scaled back.

Legislative Response: Urgency and Bipartisan Debate
State lawmakers from both parties have expressed a shared sense of urgency ahead of the special session. “This is not just a financial issue; it’s a matter of protecting the services Delawareans rely on every day,” stated House Majority Leader Kerri Evelyn Harris. The rapid timeline for addressing the budget gap reflects widespread concern about the ability to fund core government operations in the coming year.
Bill Details: Separation Bill Proposal
At issue are two provisions of the complex law that pertain to tax breaks for large businesses, specifically those related to research and development expenses and equipment investments. The new provisions gave business owners greater flexibility in claiming deductions for these expenses and made these favorable terms retroactive to 2022.
In response to the federal tax act’s impact, Rep. Harris is leading the introduction of a “separation bill,” formally known as the Delaware Corporate Tax Independence Act. The measure aims to decouple the state’s corporate tax code from recent federal changes, restoring Delaware’s authority to set its own definitions for corporate income, deductions, and exemptions. Proponents argue that this move would help stabilize state revenue and protect funding for essential services, while maintaining Delaware’s competitive business environment.
Stakeholder Perspectives: Diverse Reactions from Lawmakers and Advocates
Rep. Daniel Short (R-RD39) image from Delaware Legislature website.
Supporters of the separation bill, primarily among Democratic lawmakers, emphasize the need to preserve the state’s fiscal health and prevent cuts to education and health care. “We cannot allow federal decisions to undermine our ability to govern responsibly at the state level,” said Rep. Harris.
The Delaware BioScience Association (Delaware Bio), a group dedicated to advancing bioscience innovation in Delaware, noted in a recent post that the OBBBA “once again allows companies to deduct their domestic R&D costs upfront instead of stretching it out over five years.” Proponents of the change maintain that it provides both predictability and a boost to advanced manufacturing and rising start-ups in the biotech sector, enterprises that many Delaware officials believe will be key to delivering future quality jobs and new sources of state and local revenue.
Delaware State Chamber of Commerce tax expert Marie Holliday was quoted in the same piece saying that the legislation was an investment in the long-term growth of critical emerging industries. “I believe this is a win for our state,” she said.
State Rep. Danny Short, R-Seaford, a member of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, questioned the governor’s skewed sense of urgency.
“Early this year, the Meyer administration presented the JFC with projections showing slowing state revenue growth and significantly higher outlays outpacing that growth,” he said. “In fact, it predicted that spending would increase by 5% in each of the next two fiscal years, that we would entirely burn through our $469 million reserve budget smoothing fund, and would face a budget deficit of nearly $408 million by FY 2028. That’s an amount nearly identical to what the governor cited in calling us back into session! Somehow, that wasn’t a priority, but this is?”
Analysis from the Caesar Rodney Institute
Charlie Copeland (CRI) image from caesarrodney.org.afsaf
Charlie Copeland, president of the Caesar Rodney Institute (CRI), offers a different perspective, urging that Delaware’s budget woes are rooted more in longstanding state-level spending decisions than in federal tax law changes. Pointing to years of CRI research, Copeland highlights that the state’s fiscal challenges are the result of persistent spending growth—a pattern evident long before the most recent federal tax reforms.
“Federal tax changes may have accelerated our budget problems, but as we’ve noted at CRI for years, this is a Delaware-made problem,” Copeland writes. He notes that for six consecutive years, lawmakers have approved supplemental “off-budget” spending bills, adding more than $915 million outside the regular budget process, which has increased overall state spending beyond what is officially reported. For instance, the Fiscal Year 2024 budget included a $5.6 billion general fund, plus a $195 million one-time supplemental bill, resulting in a 13.2% spending increase—more than twice the rate of inflation.
Copeland argues that Delaware’s recent budget surpluses, often described by state officials as proof of prudent management, were actually the product of one-time federal COVID-19 relief funds from both the Trump and Biden administrations. When that aid ended, the state’s familiar boom-and-bust cycle returned: new governors inherit deficits, raise taxes, increase spending, and repeat the cycle.
The core problem, according to CRI, is that Delaware’s spending is growing at an unsustainable pace—projected at about 6.9% per year through 2027, while revenues are expected to grow just 2% annually. By that time, state spending is forecasted to outpace revenue growth by more than threefold, potentially deepening future deficits.
Beyond spending, Copeland points to Delaware’s broader economic challenges: slow growth, an aging population, and the loss of young workers and high earners. Delaware’s economy has consistently lagged the national average, and the state now has one of the lowest shares of young adults and is among the nation’s oldest by median age. These trends limit economic growth and put further strain on the tax base, especially as the costs of health care and social services rise with an older population.
Next Steps: Upcoming Vote and Possible Outcomes
The separation bill is expected to receive a committee hearing on November 13, with a floor vote anticipated soon thereafter. If passed, the legislation would take effect in the next fiscal year, allowing Delaware to set its own corporate tax policies independent of federal changes. If the measure fails, lawmakers may need to consider alternative budget cuts or revenue-raising options to close the gap ahead of the next budget cycle.
Conclusion: High Stakes for Delaware’s Fiscal Future
As Delaware lawmakers prepare to debate the separation bill, the outcome will have significant implications for state finances and essential public services. Residents, educators, health care providers, and business leaders alike are watching closely to see how the General Assembly addresses the shortfall—and whether Delaware will chart its own course in corporate taxation and spending reform. The special session promises to be a pivotal moment in the state’s ongoing efforts to balance fiscal responsibility with the needs of its citizens.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FB_IMG_1631792563094-002-1.jpg,,,2025-11-12 14:57:36.038987

In a gruesome murder that shocked the state in 2024 and culminated in a frantic weeklong search in Gallatin County, a jury has convicted Darren Christopher Abbey of deliberate homicide as he killed Dustin Kjersem, whose body was found at a campsite near Big Sky.
During the time before Abbey was apprehended, authorities told the public not to camp in the area after concerns about the killer still being on the loose in the heavily forested area, which is also hosts a huge resort.
The original crime scene indicated extreme violence such that originally it was called in as a suspected bear attack. However, when authorities arrived and began their investigation they quickly concluded Kjersem’s death was the result of a violent struggle, not due to an animal.
During the weeklong court case, the Gallatin County Attorney’s office presented evidence that showed Abbey met Kjersem while camping in October 2024. The two reportedly shared drinks in Kjersem’s tent before Abbey attacked him, striking him multiple times with a block of wood, an axe, and stabbing him with a screwdriver.
Authorities also said that Abbey later admitted to taking Kjersem’s firearms, cooler, cell phones and other belongings. Prosecutors say he returned the next day to conceal evidence. Law enforcement found no signs of an animal attack.
A Montana State Crime Lab revealed DNA evidence of Abbey on a beer can inside the tent, linking him to the scene.
Abbey will remain in custody until the sentencing on the case, which is scheduled for 1:30 p.m., on Dec. 30, before Gallatin County District Court Judge Peter Ohman.
“This verdict reflects our community’s expectation that violent acts results from the loss of life will be met with accountability,” said Gallatin County District Attorney Audrey Cromwell. “We are grateful to the jury for their thoughtful consideration of the evidence and to the law enforcement officers whose thorough investigation made this conviction possible. My heart goes out to the victim’s family, who have shown great strength and dignity throughout this process.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LJ-aerial-1024x790.jpg,,,2025-11-12 14:57:36.038987

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Unionized health care workers at Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital have not held back in criticizing private and public leaders for poor management of the hospitals.
Initial frustration took aim at the hospital’s now-bankrupt owner Prospect Medical Holdings and the former majority stakeholder, Leonard Green, which sapped the hospitals’ balance sheets to boost executive salaries and payouts to shareholders. Then, it was The Centurion Foundation, the nonprofit prospective buyer, which faced union concern for its lack of hospital experience and seemingly shaky financial plan.
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals has now shifted its ire to Rhode Island Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Charest, who it accuses of “unlawfully interfering” in the sale of the Providence and North Providence hospitals.
Several dozen union members gathered outside Fatima Hospital in North Providence Tuesday afternoon, bundled in hats and coats amid freezing wind chills, to publicly condemn Charest for courting an alternative buyer when the state had already approved a sale to Centurion. 
Recent filings in federal bankruptcy court in Dallas revealed that Charest, who formerly worked as CEO and president of Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, began courting Landmark’s owner, Prime Healthcare, to see if the company was interested in acquiring Roger Williams and Fatima. 
The timeline of Charest’s interactions remains fuzzy. Gov. Dan McKee’s office said Charest reached out in September or October, while Attorney General Peter Neronha indicated he was aware of Prime’s interest well before that.
But either way, Charest’s outreach began after the June 2024 state regulatory decision granting Centurion conditional approval to buy the hospitals
“There’s something fundamentally wrong with that,” Chris Callaci, the union’s general counsel, said at the rally Tuesday. “Secretary Charest is supposed to be representing the interests of Rhode Islanders, not carrying Prime’s water. We should be seeing the Centurion deal to the finish line, not undermining it in favor of Prime Healthcare.”
Callaci warned that Charest, and by extension McKee, exposed the state to “significant legal jeopardy.”

– Chis Callaci, general counsel for the United Nurses and Allied Professionals


In a follow-up interview Tuesday night, Callaci alleged that Charest’s actions breached state contract and business law, grounds for what is known as a claim of tortious interference in business relationships. 
Kerri White, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services, referred requests for comment to McKee’s office. 
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, defended the administration’s actions in a statement Tuesday afternoon but did not specifically address allegations against Charest. 
“The McKee Administration’s focus is ensuring that both hospitals remain open — providing vital care to Rhode Islanders and supporting the dedicated employees who make that care possible,” DaRocha said. “We want to see a buyer, whether Centurion, Prime, or another party, complete a deal that keeps the hospitals operating.”
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, which represents more than one-fifth of the state’s behavioral health beds. They accounted for more 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024 and Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state. 
Closing either or both facilities would have catastrophic consequences for patients, workers and the entire state health care system.
DaRocha also said the state is developing a “plan B” if the sale to Centurion does not move forward, but did not provide any details.

On the brink
The looming threat of closure solidified in October, when Prospect, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, indicated it wanted to close the facilities by Dec. 31. The company in court filings explained that it could not keep covering the operating losses for the facilities, expressing doubt that the delayed sale to Centurion would ever close.
Centurion has struggled to lure investors to back the $150 million in bonds needed to meet the financial terms the state tied to the approval of the deal, despite multiple revisions that reduced the upfront cash requirements. Negotiations approved by a federal bankruptcy judge on Friday ensure the hospitals have enough funding to stay open through the end of the month, but their future remains in jeopardy if Centurion can’t close the deal.
Enter Prime Healthcare, a California for-profit that has made a name for itself buying hospitals in bankruptcy nationwide, including Woonsocket’s Landmark Medical in 2013.
Charest, who led Landmark under Prime until 2017, touted the company’s record in a statement supplied via Prime’s spokesperson. 
“We have reached out to Prime Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit public charity, because of their unique ability to save and improve hospitals in times of crisis nationally and ensure award-winning quality, equity, and access for communities,” Charest said. “Time and time again they have saved hospitals even amidst the greatest challenges and have the national scale, leadership, clinical quality, and dedication to charitable care that can ensure these hospitals continue their missions.”
The praise leaves out Prime’s history of Medicare and billing fraud and illegal federal kickback schemes, which resulted in three separate settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice totaling more than $100 million from 2018 to 2021. The California company is the only medical facility to have settled this many federal cases in recent history, according to a 2023 Reuters investigation of medical settlements. 
Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, said in an emailed response Tuesday that the settlements resulted in no finding of fault or liability by the company.
“The exceptional care and quality for which Prime Healthcare is recognized were never questioned; the matters were concluded successfully, with independent audit verification showing performance better than peers,” True said.
Callaci still has doubts.
“I do not believe for a second that those three settlements with the DOJ are just garden variety settlements,” Callaci said in an interview Tuesday night. 
Since taking over Landmark in Woonsocket in 2013, UNAP’s 500 hospital workers at the hospital have had to fight against the company for competitive pay and benefits, said Lynn Blais, union president.
“They are definitely not your best corporate partner when it comes to worker relationships,” Blais said in an interview Tuesday.

Profits over people  
Part of Prime’s model relies on cost-cutting measures, including workers and services. A few months after buying eight Illinois hospitals this spring, Prime laid off 100 workers, while suspending pediatric services at one of the hospitals, ending obstetric and maternal care at another, and withdrawing a trauma designation at a third.The service cuts drew criticism from U.S. Sens. Richard Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Illinois Democrats, who urged the company to reconsider in a May 20 letter.
“Hospitals often measure their success by the patients they save and the ability to improve health in their surrounding neighborhoods,” Durbin and Duckworth wrote. “However, as the grip of for-profit hospital systems tightens across our nation’s health care networks, profitability has risen as a primary indicator of success for hospital owners. When operations are centered around a hospital’s ability to generate as much profit as possible, it often comes at the expense of patients, staff, and the quality and safety of care.”
It’s a reality patients and workers at Fatima and Roger Williams endured for the last decade under Leonard Green and Prospect. As recently as late 2023, Prospect failed to pay its vendors on time, leading to equipment and medical supply shortages and canceled procedures, according to court documents. Critical infrastructure repairs have not been performed, prompting citations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which warned in April 2024 that the hospitals remained in “substantial noncompliance” for basic safety standards.
True sought to distinguish Prime’s for-profit arm from its separate charitable foundation. The latter would be potentially buying Rhode Island hospitals, True said.
Anxiety seeps through the walls and exam rooms at Fatima, where Blais works as a nurse. 
“They’re frustrated, they’re afraid but most of the people there are so committed to the organization and to the patients,” she said of the 2,400 workers across both facilities. “They just want to know their job is secure and that the hospitals are secure.”
Who offers that security — Centurion, Prime, or someone else — is unimportant to most workers, Blais said. But she shares Callaci’s concerns with Prime, and with Charest’s role.
“He worked for them, he retired with the promise of a retirement package from them,” she said of Charest. “To come in, under the guise of a cabinet member for the governor, it doesn’t smell right.”
But a bad smell doesn’t necessarily constitute illegality.
The letter of the law 
Rhode Island’s contract laws allow for claims of tortious interference in business relationships, as Callaci suggested, but only when certain conditions are met. Most importantly, there has to be a contract already finalized, said Robert Flanders Jr., a partner at Whelan Corrente & Flanders LLP and former Rhode Island Supreme Court justice. 
Centurion has yet to meet the state-imposed financial requirements tied to the sale, so the terms of its contract appear unfinalized, Flanders said in an interview Wednesday.
“If they are not under contract, the state can’t wait forever to see if the sale is going to go through,” Flanders explained. “The state’s interests are to make sure a sale occurs. I don’t see a problem in the state looking to obtain alternative buyers under those circumstances.”
There also must be proven malicious intent, a condition Flanders again thought was lacking in this case.










The state’s interests are to make sure a sale occurs. I don’t see a problem in the state looking to obtain alternative buyers under those circumstances. 


– Robert Flanders Jr, a partner at Whelan Corrente & Flanders LLP


Neronha declined to comment on the potential legal merits of Centurion’s claims against the state in an interview Wednesday. But, Neronha said Centurion failed to close the deal by the state-imposed Oct. 31 deadline, freeing up other suitors to come in.
Yet Neronha also said, “I don’t think anyone in state government should be a cheerleader for any potential purchaser of the state hospitals.”
Callaci in response sought to differentiate between a prospective buyer jumping in of their own accord, and Charest’s courtship of a company that had not already expressed interest.
“The governor and the health department are actively undermining their own transaction,” Callaci said. “That’s a different kettle of fish.”
Even if Prime makes an offer — something Callaci remains skeptical will materialize — the application must still go through a rigorous state review by the AG’s office and Rhode Island Department of Health. In Centurion’s case, it took over a year and multiple failed applications before a proposal passed muster with state regulators.
“We don’t have any time left,” Callaci said.
And Neronha promised that a new proposal would be subject to the same “intense” scrutiny and negotiations his office gave to Centurion, with strict conditions to ensure that the buyer keeps the facilities running.
“I’m not going to hand them over on a silver platter,” Neronha said Wednesday. “I don’t trust anybody. I’m objectively skeptical as a regulator.”
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for Prospect’s Rhode Island subsidiary, said in an emailed response Tuesday that Prospect and the Centurion Foundation continue to work with state and private financing entities to close the transaction “at the earliest possible date.” 
Court filings indicate Centurion aims to close the deal by early or mid-December, relying on a bridge loan from Bank of America in lieu of investor-backed bond financing.
An update on the deal is scheduled for Nov. 18 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina is awarding $13.8 million to counties and communities to help rebuild critical business infrastructure after Helene, part of a state-funded program aimed at revitalizing commercial districts in the west.
The new round of funding will pay for 19 projects across the region, including three emergency projects. That includes restoring utilities like water, sewer and gas, as well as repairing roads, buildings and sidewalks.
Gov. Josh Stein called it a “much-needed shot in the arm to the Main Streets that businesses depend on” in a statement Wednesday.
“I’m proud of the work being done to restore critical infrastructure and help those communities recover,” Stein said.
The grant program, run by the NC Department of Commerce, totals $55 million. It was created by lawmakers as part of a Helene relief package passed in March, as Republicans skeptical of direct grants to businesses instead opted for other avenues to help revive them.
Nine other projects, totaling $7.3 million, were awarded funding through the program in July.
Stein has requested the Commerce division overseeing the grant program to modify the grant process, his office said, allowing cash-strapped local governments to access more of the money up front.
Among the projects funded by the new round of grants:

Almost $2.5 million to repair and rebuild the popular Biltmore Village region in Asheville, a tourist hotspot.
More than $2.7 million to repair sidewalks, ADA ramps, and other accessibility measures in Marshall.
Almost $1.8 million to Hendersonville to restore sidewalks and build new waterlines and fire hydrants.
More than $1.5 million to the town of Maggie Valley, which sought emergency funding to repair its sewer system.
$1 million for a new water main in Bryson City, also requested as emergency funding.
Over $1.2 million to the town of Hot Springs to restore ADA access and sidewalks.
$1 million to replace stormwater pipes in Black Mountain.

(Photo via Dave Bushaw campaign)An independent candidate, Dave Bushaw, announced he would join the race for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in 2026.
Bushaw, a 31-year-old Hawkeye resident, is campaigning for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican. Hinson is running for the open U.S. Senate seat, as Sen. Joni Ernst is not seeking another term in office.
While Bushaw has had experience in Democratic politics — he worked as an organizer for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in 2019 and 2020 in Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina — the candidate said he is running as an independent because “both parties walked away from the people who built this country.”

“There’s the Republican wing and the Democratic wing, but they are both part of the same bird that feeds the corporate class,” Bushaw said in a statement. “Politicians let corporate greed gut our main streets, poison our rivers, and turn neighbors against each other while they bootlick for donations and power. It’s time to take that power back and put it in the hands of the workers who keep this country alive.”
After working on Sanders’ campaign, Bushaw worked for United Today, Stronger Tomorrow, an organization focused on political organizing in rural communities to tackle issues like health care access and job losses. His campaign website also highlighted that he became one of the youngest self-made, first-generation independent farmland owners in the U.S. by starting a squash farm in Hawkeye called “Solidarity Fields” at age 19. He also has performed as a folk musician at labor union strikes throughout the country.
In a Wednesday video kicking off his campaign, Bushaw said he was running because politics has “turned into shouting matches and headlines” instead of being focused on addressing the needs of regular people.
“We deserve health care that doesn’t cripple our bank accounts, a job market that values workers over billionaires, and a government that wants to win the wars at home, not endless regime change war around the world,” Bushaw said.
Bushaw plans to hold his first campaign rally Nov. 22 in his hometown, West Union, at the Fayette County Fairgrounds.
There are several candidates running to become the nominees for both major parties — former state legislator Joe Mitchell, state Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, and state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, are running to become the GOP nominee.
State Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque; Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25, and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, are running as Democratic candidates.

Carmack/National Park Service)The state’s latest plan to kill bears in part of Western Alaska to try to boost a flagging caribou population has drawn a new legal challenge.
Environmental groups on Monday filed a lawsuit in state Superior Court that seeks to strike down the Alaska Board of Game’s July approval of a controversial predator control program in the part of the state used by the Mulchatna caribou herd.
The lawsuit, filed by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity, is the latest step in a legal and political battle over state efforts to increase the herd size. It names the board, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the department’s commissioner as defendants. 
The lawsuit argues that the revived program approved by the Board of Game suffers from many of the same flaws that were in the previous program. That program had been approved by the board in 2022 but was overturned by court rulings earlier in the year that resulted from a previous lawsuit filed by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance.
Two state judges found that the program, under which 186 brown bears, five black bears and 20 wolves have been killed since 2023, violated the elements of the Alaska constitution.
Monday’s lawsuit says the new predator control program is largely the same as the old one and it continues to violate the Alaska constitution’s requirement for sustained yield of natural resources. For Alaska, the principle of sustained yield holds that renewable resources should be managed so that they can exist indefinitely.
There are two ways that the sustained yield requirement is violated, according to the lawsuit.
The board, when it approved the predator control plan presented by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, “failed to take a hard look at brown and black bear population data” for the targeted area, thus failing to properly consider impacts to those populations, the lawsuit said.
And the plan has no end point, meaning there is no trigger for suspension of predator control if bear populations drop below a minimum threshold deemed necessary for their sustainability, the lawsuit said.
“The Board of Game gave the Alaska Department of Fish and Game the authority to aerially shoot any bears of any age across 40,000 square miles until 2028, with no population data or cap on the number of bears killed,” Nicole Schmitt, executive director with the Alaska Wildlife Alliance.
She noted that the southeast border of the targeted area is only 3 miles from Lake Clark National Preserve, 30 miles from Katmai National Park and 50 miles from McNeil and Brooks Falls, sites that are world-famous for the large numbers of brown bears that gather there to fish for salmon. Meanwhile, the western border reaches two national wildlife refuges, “which means this program threatens bears who move across vast stretches of public lands,” she said.
Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the program “a disgraceful misuse of public resources and a betrayal of the trust Alaskans place in their wildlife managers.”
“There’s no excuse for the state of Alaska to be gunning down bears from helicopters,” Freeman said in the statement.
The commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game defended the program, though he did not specifically address the claims in the new lawsuit.
“ADF&G is committed to all users of the herd in rebuilding this population, which has been identified as important for providing high levels of human consumption under state statute and regulation,” Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang said in a statement.
Vincent-Lang said “intensive management,” or IM, has shown to be helping the caribou herd. Intensive management is the term Alaska wildlife managers use for predator-control programs.
“There is strong evidence that neither disease nor nutrition are preventing this herd from recovering. Department predator removal efforts in the Mulchatna caribou herd IM program are administered to reduce wolf and bear populations in small, defined areas for short periods of time, to enhance caribou calf survival and to increase herd abundance,” Vincent-Lang said in his statement. “Predation has been isolated as the limiting factor preventing the herd from growing, and predator removal is increasing calf survival—we know that now—and we have seen increased calf survival as a result of our past IM efforts.”
The Mulchatna caribou herd crashed in recent decades, and there is heated debate about the cause.
The herd peaked at about 200,000 animals in 1997, when it provided up to 4,770 caribou for subsistence hunting in the region’s communities, according to the Department of Fish and Game. But the population crashed after then and is now estimated at about 16,000 animals, according to the department. Hunting has been closed in recent years.
State wildlife officials argue that predation by bears and wolves on caribou calves is the reason for the decline. The department has stated a goal of boosting the herd to a size ranging from 30,000 to 80,000 animals, enough to support resumption of hunting.
Backers of the Mulchatna predator control program have included the Alaska Federation of Natives, which passed a resolution in 2023 that supported the program because the organization says it is necessary to ensure food security in that part of the state.
But critics of the program, including some veteran Alaska wildlife biologists, argue that other factors caused the herd’s population crash. Among the cited factors is a change in habitat, driven by long-term warming, that makes the region less supportive of lichen-eating caribou and more favorable to moose and other animals dependent on woody plants. Migratory tundra caribou herds around the Arctic have suffered similar problems, with overall population declines of 65% in the past two to three decades, according to the 2024 Arctic Report Card released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The Board of Game and Department of Fish and Game have lost past court fights over Mulchatna predator control.
Aside from having judges rule that the earlier program was unconstitutional, one of the judges found in May that the department acted in bad faith by continuing to conduct aerial shooting this spring even after the program was declared legally void.

Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh must decide if language missing from the state Constitution’s directive on when and how to draw congressional district maps means lawmakers were allowed to redraw districts like they did in a September special session. 
For those challenging the new map, the omission means lawmakers overstepped their authority. 
Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing the challengers, said drafters of the constitution adopted in 1945 knew what they were doing when they left out the power to revise districts at will.
“We think that language is pretty clear on its face,” Hatfield said.
If the constitutional convention had intended to prevent mid-decade redistricting, the delegates would have included a prohibition, Louis Capozzi, solicitor general in Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office, told the judge Wednesday. 
Instead, he noted, they didn’t even discuss it.
“The General Assembly has the power to act unless the Missouri Constitution expressly takes a particular power away,” he said.
Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers into special session in September at the insistence of President Donald Trump to give Republicans seven instead of six of Missouri’s eight congressional seats.
The new Missouri map targets the Kansas-City based 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, to flip to the Republican Party.
Trump wants to preserve and expand the GOP’s slim majority in Congress, where they have a 219-213 edge in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats have countered with gerrymandering plans in states they control, with California on Nov. 5  approving a plan to deliver up to five seats to Democrats.
The Missouri Republican Party, which intervened in the case, argued that Limbaugh didn’t have the power to consider the challenge. The federal Constitution grants state legislatures exclusive power over the time, place and manner of congressional elections, Washington, D.C., attorney John Gore said, subject only to federal law.
“That means courts, including this court, do not have free reign to review and invalidate state legislative enactments on federal elections, including congressional redistricting plans,” Gore said.
At the end of Wednesday’s 45-minute trial, Limbaugh gave attorneys on both sides 10 days to file proposed judgments. No decision will be delivered until after those filings.
The case is one of six pending in various courts concerning the new map. 
One case, filed by the Missouri NAACP, challenged the authority of Kehoe to call lawmakers into a special session for redistricting. Limbaugh ruled against the NAACP but an appeal is certain.
The next case to be heard will be a Thursday trial before Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green over an effort to force a referendum on the map. The trial, postponed from Nov. 3, will be over whether a referendum petitioning effort can begin before legislation has been signed by the governor.
A federal trail scheduled for Nov. 25 will test whether a state referendum on a redistricting plan violates the U.S. Constitution.
Two other cases, filed in Jackson County, contest various aspects of the gerrymandered map, including whether a Kansas City voting district was inadvertently placed into two separate districts. 
The constitutional directive on redistricting mandates that Missouri lawmakers revise district lines after census results are delivered to the state. The provision mandates that the districts be as equal in population as possible and made up of compact, continuous territory.
The current district boundaries were set in 2022 after the 2020 census.
The provision creates an obligation to redistrict after a census and no obligation to do it at any other time, Capozzi said. But without an express prohibition, lawmakers are free to do so.
And, he added, the boundaries of congressional districts are a political question the courts should avoid.
“This court cannot wade into that political fight without an express warrant,” he said.
The case is more ordinary than Capozzi portrayed it, Hatfield said. He likened it to every other challenge to new legislation.
That means the courts must measure it against the prohibitions on legislative power, both expressly stated and interpreted. In the case of the silence on mid-decade congressional redistricting, he said, Limbaugh should look at the provisions governing how legislative districts are determined.
That provision allows districts to be “altered from time to time as public convenience may require. The omission of that language is a conscious choice made by the drafters of the constitution, he said.
“The state’s view seems to say that you need a ‘thou shalt not’ sentence in here,” Hatfield said. “That’s never been the law in Missouri.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_1113-scaled-e1762973502477-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 13:57:38.794940

Ron DeSantis’ delay in announcing special election dates to fill two vacancies in the Florida Legislature, voters in parts of Palm Beach and Hillsborough counties will not have representation in Tallahassee when the regular legislative session begins in January.
That situation could not occur under a bill filed in the Florida Senate on Wednesday.
The proposal (SB 460) by Democratic Sen. Tina Polsky, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, says that whenever there is a vacancy for which a special election is required, the governor would be required to fix the dates of a special primary and general election within 14 days after the vacancy occurs.
The bill also says that if a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the Senate or House less than 126 days before the first day of the regular legislative session, the governor must within five days set those election dates. The dates set must provide for at least two weeks between the special primary election and special general election and “must ensure that both elections are held before the first day of the regular legislative session to prevent a lapse in representation.”
The measure says that if the governor fails to set those election dates in the time proscribed, “any qualified elector” living in the affected district may file a petition in circuit court to set those election dates.
DeSantis selected then-state Sen. Jay Collins from Florida’s Senate District 14 to become his lieutenant governor on Aug. 12. He did not announce the special election dates to choose his successor until Oct. 24, some 73 days later.
The governor selected Rep. Mike Caruso, R-Palm Beach, to serve as the Palm Beach Clerk of the County Court on Aug. 18. He did not announce the special election dates for Caruso’s House District 87 seat until Oct. 24, 67 days after the seat became vacant.
In both cases, the primary elections are set for Jan. 13, 2026, the day the 2026 regular legislative starts. The special elections in both districts are scheduled for March 24, 2026. That’s more than a week after the session is scheduled to conclude on March 13.
The ACLU of Florida filed a lawsuit in late September regarding the governor’s failure at that point to announce election dates for the Senate District 14 seat.
“I’m not sure why the governor proves himself repeatedly unwilling to call timely special elections,” said Nicholas Warren, staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida, in a press release issued on Sept. 30. “His predecessors like Jeb Bush and Rick Scott always acted swiftly to ensure citizens retained their voice in government. Governor DeSantis’ refusal to follow their example is not just concerning, it’s also against the law.”
The civil liberties group filed a lawsuit on behalf of Santa Rosa and Brevard county voters in January, after state Rep. Joel Rudman and state Sen. Randy Fine vacated their seats to run for Congress. The lawsuit noted that DeSantis had not set special election dates more than six weeks after the lawmakers announced their resignations.
A House companion to Polsky’s measure has not yet been introduced.

(Getty Images)West Virginia public schools say they need around $252 million for school safety upgrades, including security cameras, weapon detection systems and resource officers.
Not every project will be funded due to funding at the local and state level.
Micah Whitlow
“There’s a big need out there for things,” said Micah Whitlow, director of the West Virginia Department of Education’s Office of School Facilities. Whitlow presented the West Virginia school safety and security report Wednesday to state school board members.
He explained that some of the requests for safety upgrades this year are out of counties’ abilities to pay for from their own school budgets. 
Local school systems spent $40.7 million on safety expenditures during the 2024-25 school year, the school safety report said.
Jackson County had the largest safety funding request for the current school year, seeking more than $55 million for projects. The district spent $446,192 in local funds on the projects last year. 
Marion County had the second highest request at $15 million. The West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind said they needed $1.5 million. 
Schools have made progress on installing safe school entries — also known as mantraps — that include a monitored single point of entry and exit with a system of doors and barriers to vet visitors. There are 401 schools with the mantraps, but 232 are still seeking around $52 million in funding to install their own. 
“In 2020, when all this started … 368 schools needed safe school entries,” Whitlow said. “There has been that gradual decline of that need due to counties, you know, taking a priority for safety and investing funds.”
Last year, state school officials said they needed $258 million for safety projects, but state and local funding fell short to accomplish many of the proposed projects. 
The 2025-26 funding requests included more than $30 million for prevention and resources officers — an annual recurring cost due to salaries and benefits. Schools also requested $30 million for security cameras to provide video covers in classrooms, outdoor areas, entries and more. 
The School Board Authority is currently mulling over how they’ll hand out $43.5 million in funding after 31 counties submitted their requests for projects, including some school safety upgrades like safe school entries. The requests submitted amounted to more than $170 million, and the SBA will make an announcement of approved projects in December. 
“It’s amazing how many counties [that] need help,” said state school board Vice President Victor Gabriel. “It’s a shame we don’t have money to grant them all. There’s some really worthwhile projects out there.”
State department of education leaders will present the school safety needs to lawmakers in the coming weeks ahead of the 2026 legislative session, when the Legislature will determine the level of public education funding and school safety funding.
Whitlow noted that some of the projected needs included a request from lawmakers about how much it would cost to put security cameras in all West Virginia schools.

Connecticut doesn’t have a law that caps rent increases, despite housing advocates’ attempts to lobby for one before the legislature.
Connecticut does require municipalities with a population of 25,000 or more to establish fair rent commissions. The commissions have the power to limit or reverse increases after a review of complaints filed by tenants, although landlords can appeal decisions in court.
Certain protected tenants who live in a municipality without a fair rent commission may bring action to the Superior Court.
A 2024 law also requires landlords to give tenants at least 45 days’ written notice of rent increases or for those with lease terms of one month or less, a notice that equals the length of the lease.
Residents rank the cost and availability of housing as one of the top issues facing the state, according to a recent YouGov poll, commissioned by the Connecticut Regional Plan Association.

(Photo by Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator)There have been some important developments in Louisiana higher education in recent weeks, including LSU firing its football coach, replacing its athletics director and hiring a new system president and chancellor. 
One you could have missed was the first meeting of the committee that will guide the University of New Orleans’ move from the University of Louisiana System to the LSU System. You might not have been aware because LSU neglected to follow the state’s Open Meetings Law and post the required public notice 24 hours before the group met on the UNO campus Nov. 5y. 
It wasn’t until Illuminator reporter Piper Hutchinson contacted LSU that the school posted the notice online around 4 p.m. the day before; that’s 17 hours before the meeting started , if you’re keeping track.
The only time public bodies, which include the UNO transition committee, can skirt the 24-hour notice rule is in the event of an emergency, according to attorney Scott Sternberg, who often represents the news media in cases involving open meetings, public records and other First Amendment concerns.
“The right to observe meetings of the government is in the Constitution. That means it’s one of our most important rights,” Sternberg said. “In theory, the meeting could be completely annulled based on the failure to notify.”
The meeting did take place, and it revealed LSU’s continued struggle to grasp the Open Meetings Law. 
Rico Alvendia, the LSU Board of Supervisors member who’s chairing the UNO transition committee, told the dozens of members gathered they should meet privately in assigned workgroups in the coming weeks to come up with recommendations for the full committee to consider. 
This, too, would be a violation of state law.
“A subgroup or a working group, or whatever you like, if it’s a division of a larger public body, that’s a committee” that must adhere to the Open Meetings Law, Sternberg said.
In attendance at the meeting was Trey Jones, LSU’s general counsel. The university’s top attorney told the Illuminator he didn’t consider the subcommittees subject to the law.
“It’s a little different,” Jones said. “We’re relying on expertise of people, and not so much a committee that’s gathering its own information in an open setting, voting on what to bring to this committee.”
“These work groups will come up and bring things that will either be rejected or accepted by the larger group,” he added.
That sounds just like a legislative committee, or the subcommittee of any policymaking public body that considers proposals and then advances them to the group as a whole for further deliberations. And as much as Jones might want to consider the UNO transition committee’s plans an informal spitballing session, state law doesn’t allow such informality.    
UNO and its future under the LSU System might not directly impact you, but there’s cause for concern when the state’s Open Meetings Law is so casually overlooked. LSU is easily one of the state’s most powerful institutions, with the governor hand-picking its board and routinely weighing in on leadership decisions.
Transparency should be paramount with so much at stake in terms of public resources and the school that helped build the New Orleans workforce.

(Photo courtesy of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles)After a lengthy development process, Virginians will now be able to use their smartphones at select locations to share their personal identification cards, the Department of Motor Vehicles announced on Wednesday morning.
With the debut of Virginia Mobile ID, Virginians may use it at Transportation Security Administration security checkpoints in airports, at select Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority stores and at Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) customer service centers.
Virginia adopted standards for electronic credentials years ago. What happened?

The new digital ID tool comes as smartphones infiltrate nearly every aspect of modern life, with people using them to pay for services, access vital information and easily share their personal credentials, including state IDs and driver’s licenses.
“Most of us rely heavily on our phones, which is why Virginians should have access to a safe, secure form of mobile identification on the devices they use all the time,” Secretary of Transportation W. Sheppard Miller III said in a statement.“The Virginia Mobile ID option protects your identity and privacy in the digital age, keeping you in control of what information you share.”
Over 250 TSA checkpoints nationwide, including several at airports in Virginia — Richmond (RIC), Reagan Washington National, Washington-Dulles, Norfolk, Newport News/Williamsburg, and Roanoke — will accept Virginia’s Mobile ID, which is available at no cost in the Apple Store and Google Play.
Virginia State Police, all DMV customer service centers, and nine Virginia ABC stores in the Richmond area will also accept the ID.
The agency is still working to expand the app to be used across the commonwealth at retailers, restaurants, and with local law-enforcement agencies. Virginia expects to roll out the Mobile ID program with digital wallets in the coming months.
In 2017, the lawmakers passed legislation creating the standards for issuing, reviewing and displaying electronic credentials after the DMV conducted a year-long pilot research program.
One of the chief concerns with the application has been privacy.
DMV, which has touted the app as “secure,” said in its releases that, instead of users handing over a full ID — or even a phone — Virginians can choose exactly which information to share and authorize each request, such as confirming they’re over 21 without disclosing their name and address. 
The agency said data is transmitted securely via encryption directly between a customer’s phone and electronic reader devices, and never stores or tracks user activity.
The agency is also the founding member of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators’ Digital Trust Service, a nationwide security protocol and intrastate clearinghouse for mobile ID. The agency said this ensures Virginia Mobile ID is one of the most secure digital credentials available. 
“The commonwealth has long been a leader in innovation and Virginia Mobile ID is the latest example of how we’re modernizing services for residents,” Gerald Lackey, DMV commissioner, said in a statement. “Over the next few months, we’ll continue expanding mobile ID acceptance with partners, while adding new functionality, such as digital wallet integration. Virginians are well positioned for a digital-first world with Virginia Mobile ID.”

The audit says existing information is inadequate to fully understand financial implications of decisions by agencies to lease or rent office space. In this Jan. 16, 2025, image, Proffitt speaks to a committee of the Kansas Legislature at the Capitol. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Department of Administration responded to a report from the Kansas Legislature’s auditors by promising to upgrade outdated systems for determining costs of operating state office buildings and to reform a flawed approach to setting rental rates for state agencies.
The state of Kansas owned or leased 4.1 million square feet of office space across the state in the fiscal year ending July 1, but the Legislature’s auditing division found the Department of Administration didn’t have detailed written policies guiding estimation of operating costs or setting of rates for renters, the auditor said.
State auditors said it was “critical” the agency blend state budget and accounting systems to produce firm data. The Department of Administration committed to improving its property management practices.
The audit also said Kansas didn’t have a “regimented, formal process where a single agency examines agencies’ needs and determines the best option for both square footage and leasing versus owning. Instead, agencies have a lot of discretion in determining what works best for them.”
Frank Burnam, deputy secretary for operations at the Department of Administration, said the audit requested by Sen. Rick Billinger, R-Goodland, was appreciated because it exposed shortcomings in property management.
“It really kind of helped open our eyes into some really old, antiquated ways of calculating and determining what these costs are,” he said.
Burnam said the Department of Administration would strive to set multiyear lease rates for state agencies rather than adjust rates annually. A flat rate would provide more consistency for state agencies and reflect methods common to commercial landlords.
 
78 agencies, 524 properties
In the report released to the Legislature’s joint auditing committee this week, analysts said the state leased or owned 4.1 million square feet of office space. Two-thirds was leased from private owners, while 32% was held by the state. Overall, agencies were bound by terms of 241 lease agreements.
The audit revealed 5% of the state offices were acquired through other means. Lansing Correctional Facility was built with a lease-purchase contract. The legislative, judicial and executive branches of state government occupy 189,000 square feet of space in the Capitol or Kansas Judicial Center, but none pay for office space. Those costs were covered with a “monumental building surcharge” of $3.30 per square foot assessed against state agencies leasing space elsewhere in Shawnee County.
The audit focused on 524 state properties affiliated with 78 state agencies. The report documented state agencies’ office space in 102 of 105 counties. The outliers, for purposes of this audit, were Elk, Stanton and Wichita counties. The report excluded property in hands of state universities, school districts and district courts.
Currently, the Department of Administration must approve state agency lease agreements. The secretary of administration must inform the Legislature’s joint building committee before approving leases of privately owned space with more than 10,000 square feet or for periods longer than two years.
The Legislature and Kansas governor have direct roles in deciding whether the state purchased or built office space.
“None of these processes or approvals require agencies to formally compare the advantages, disadvantages and costs of leasing office space to purchasing office space,” the audit said.
The audit said at least 106 of 241 state agency lease agreements for privately owned buildings were for periods of more than 10 years.
It would cost the state an estimated $16.5 million to terminate all state office leases as of July 2025, auditors said. The largest penalty for breaking leases — at a cost of  about $4 million — was for two Kansas Department of Revenue locations in Topeka, the report said.
Most state agencies said they had sufficient space for all employees if they were required to work from an office. Only 24 agencies among the 78 audited said they lacked space to accommodate every staff member. Deficient agencies included the Kansas Board of Cosmetology and Kansas Department of Education.
“We’re moving into an era of AI where less office work is going to be needed, as well as more people are working in the field or remotely,” said Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta.
State agencies reported 16 of 524 office space locations across the state had unused space. Four had been unoccupied for more than five years. Three had areas unfit for occupancy. For example, Kansas Neurological Institute had a building with a mold problem and leaking roof.
 
Leased or owned
In fiscal year 2025, the audit said, state agencies in Topeka reported leasing costs for privately owned buildings were less than state-owned buildings. Auditors said the potential benefit of ownership was muddled because “DOA data on the cost of state-owned office buildings wasn’t reliable.”
Adam Proffitt, secretary of the Department of Administration, said the agency was responsible for care of the entirety of state buildings, including space that wasn’t leasable. That could be responsible for driving up the cost of state-owned property in Shawnee County, he said.
He said the Department of Administration also was obligated to make debt payments on two buildings in the Capitol Complex, and those payments were baked into leases for state-owned property.
“To be clear, D of A is not disputing that many of the leases of private office space are lower than those of state-owned space,” Proffitt said.
One-fourth of rebuilt Docking State Office Building comprised office space. New tenants include the Kansas Highway Patrol, Kansas secretary of state, state Department of Commerce and the Department of Administration.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, said the Legislature ought to determine why the secretary of the Kansas Department of Agriculture had an office in Topeka and Manhattan.
“Little things like that are just kind of ridiculous,” Tyson said. “Especially as a taxpayer.”
In 2013, then-Gov. Sam Brownback moved the Department of Agriculture to a building adjacent to the Kansas State University campus. The department maintained administrative offices in Topeka.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Profitt-on-budget-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 13:57:38.794940

Free.,US House Dems say newly released Epstein emails show Trump knew about abuse,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dems-say-newly-released-epstein-emails-show-trump-knew-about-abuse,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Democrats investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein released emails Wednesday they say show President Donald Trump knew about the financier’s abuse of underage girls as far back as 2011.The three emails released by Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform were among 23,000 pages of documents turned over to the committee by Epstein’s estate, according to Democrats.In a 2011 correspondence with the now-convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein wrote that Trump “spent hours at my house” with a victim whose name is redacted from the email. In the same email, Epstein refers to Trump as the “dog that hasn’t barked.” In a 2015 email exchange between Epstein and journalist Michael Wolff, Wolff tells Epstein that he’s heard CNN will ask Trump about his relationship with the financier. The two have an exchange about how to hypothetically “craft an answer” for Trump. Wolff responds, “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable (public relations) and political currency.”In a January 2019 email, also to Wolff, Epstein referenced a victim’s name, redacted, as having been at Trump’s Florida estate and private club, Mar-a-Lago, and wrote “Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” Emails raise more questions, leading Dem saysHouse Oversight Committee Ranking Member Robert Garcia said in a statement Wednesday the emails ""raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.”“The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately. The Oversight Committee will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims,” Garcia continued.Within hours of the committee Democrats’ release of the emails, committee Republican leaders issued a brief press release linking to “an additional 20,000 pages of documents received from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein” contained on Google Drive and Dropbox clouds. The White House did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Congress investigates after FBI backtracksThe bipartisan committee investigation began shortly after the FBI released a July memo stating the Department of Justice would not be releasing any further information on the government’s sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.Epstein was found dead, apparently by suicide, in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell where he was awaiting federal trial.The FBI’s announcement that the agency would not release further details caused a firestorm of demands to release all investigative material, even among Trump’s supporters in Congress and far-right media influencers, including Megyn Kelly and the late Charlie Kirk. Trump campaigned on releasing what are often referred to as the “Epstein files.”A bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives is aiming to force a vote on the release of the files as soon as this week after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., swears in Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva. Grijalva has pledged to be the final signature needed on a discharge petition by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., that will compel a floor vote on a bill to release all Epstein investigation files.Massie and Khanna hosted a press conference on Capitol Hill in early September featuring several women who told stories of abuse by Epstein and Maxwell.Since the FBI memo, a magnifying glass has been fixed on Trump’s past relationship with Epstein. The president sued The Wall Street Journal for reporting on a 50th birthday card Trump allegedly gave to Epstein. The card featured a cryptic message and a doodle of a naked woman with Trump’s apparent signature mimicking pubic hair. The Journal also reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein case files. The context in which his name appeared is unclear. Trump has denied the reports.",,,,2025-11-12 12:56:58.763843

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)School districts have made some progress in addressing the national shortage of school bus drivers, but there still aren’t as many drivers as there were in 2019, according to a new study.
The number of drivers has increased by 2,300, or 1.1%, since last year, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group. But there are still 21,200 fewer bus drivers than there were in 2019, a decline of 9.5%.
The researchers link the employment gain to higher wages: Average hourly wages are up 4.2% in the past year, the largest jump since the COVID-19 pandemic.
During and after the pandemic, many bus drivers retired, left the workforce or in some cases, died. Districts across the country have had to scramble to find someone to take the wheel — be it substitute teachers, administrators or even parents.
The number of bus drivers decreased by 15% between September 2019 and September 2023, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Private school bus contractors now account for 38% of the nation’s pupil transportation services, according to the National School Transportation Association.
Other school transportation options, such as ride-hailing services, have helped fill the gap in some places. But roughly half of all U.S. K–12 students rely on a school bus to get to school.
The report warns that school district budgets are tightening as federal pandemic relief funds have expired, and notes that the Trump administration has delayed some federal K-12 funding in its bid to shrink and eventually eliminate the U.S. Department of Education.
The report points to  Maine, Missouri, and Vermont as states that are dealing with especially severe bus driver shortages. It also notes that a dearth of drivers has a particularly pronounced effect on students with disabilities, and that not having enough drivers can lead to inconsistent bus schedules and routes, which contributes to absenteeism and missed school meals.

The 2-1 vote in late October reverses rate caps the FCC adopted last year under a 2023 law that allows the agency to set limits on prison phone and video call rates. Critics say the rates are kept high by limited competition among major providers such as Securus Technologies and ViaPath.
Under the new interim rules, phone calls will cost up to $0.11 per minute in large prisons and $0.18 per minute in the smallest jails. Video calls will cost up to $0.23 per minute in large facilities and as much as $0.41 in small ones.
Only three states — Florida, Kentucky and Oklahoma — currently have rates above the new rates, meaning most prison systems across the country are already below the previously adopted 2024 rate caps.
The new 2025 rates will take effect 120 days after being published in the Federal Register.
In June, the FCC had abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing the 2024 rate caps after receiving complaints from local sheriffs and prison telecom companies. Republican attorneys general from 14 states also filed a lawsuit last year challenging the commission’s authority to limit how much prisons and jails can charge for phone calls, arguing that the rules deprived correctional facilities of needed funding.
Republican Commissioners Brendan Carr and Olivia Trusty, both appointed by President Donald Trump, supported the rollback. Carr argued the previous caps limited facilities’ ability to recover safety and security costs, such as monitoring calls, leading some to scale back or eliminate calling services altogether. Trusty said the 2024 rules “did not always strike the right balance,” and cited “unintended consequences” like service disruptions in some facilities.
At least one small jail — in Baxter County, Arkansas — ended phone services earlier this year in protest of the lower rate caps.
Democratic Commissioner Anna Gomez, appointed by President Joe Biden, voted against the order and called it “indefensible.” She said the decision gives monopoly telecom providers “the authority to increase the costs for families to maintain critical connections with their loved ones in prison.”
Advocates for incarcerated people condemned the vote.
“These changes are a betrayal of the families who entrusted the FCC to protect them from the notoriously predatory correctional telecom industry,” Bianca Tylek, the executive director of Worth Rises, said in a news release. Worth Rises is a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The FCC’s latest decision comes months after New York joined California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons. Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026.
At least two states — Maryland and Missouri — considered legislation this year to make prison and jail calls more affordable. Maryland’s proposal to make calls free in state prisons did not pass, but Missouri enacted a law in August capping phone call rates at no more than 12 cents per minute in correctional centers.

Seconds later, Avila had grabbed his two dogs, car keys, put on his boots and run downstairs, not knowing he was set to lose the place he had called home for more than 25 years.
The basement fire at 271 Wethersfield Ave. forced the evacuation of 17 adults and seven children, according to the American Red Cross. It was the third fire in October that left unhoused tenants and units affected across Hartford.
“We have been fighting for three years for them to take responsibility for fixing all the problems and to pay more attention to these apartments, this is just not fair,” said Avila, who works installing flooring.

He had come back from a night shift like the majority of the tenants that work long shifts or hold more than one job in the Barry Square building.
The fire was not an isolated case in Hartford, where 83 house fires have happened between January and October this year, according to Mario Oquendo Jr., district chief of the Hartford Fire Department.
Just next to the Wethersfield Avenue building there is a blighted building from a January fire, and around the corner, a burned house from a summer fire, where four people died.
In the days following the October fire, the 271 Wethersfield Ave. tenants were not able to return right away and claim the family belongings they had to leave behind when they escaped.
Avila hoped his video cassettes and photos, some of which he brought with him from Aguascalientes, Mexico, when he came to the U.S., were still there and would not be stolen if someone broke into the locked up burnt building.

Service requests
Tenants from 271 and 267 Wethersfield Ave., along with housing equity organizer from the organization Make the Road, Teresa Quintana, said they have organized to fight for better housing conditions for the last three years.
“Every Tuesday we would go into one of those garages in the back and they would start the meeting and talking and saying ‘this is happening’ and ‘we want this to change’,” Quintana recalls. “Then they would send letters to the landlord, and they would complain as a group to the city again, and again.”
Quintana said when she initially organized tenants to send complaints to the city about cockroaches, rats and roof leaks, the forms were in English, and most of the tenants spoke Spanish only.
“There weren’t any complaints before because the form wasn’t even in Spanish. If there is no language accessibility, obviously people might have started to complain more,” Quintana said.
The tenants rallied several times — in December 2023, January 2024 and February 2025 — calling out the mayor to hold the landlord accountable for hazardous living conditions and not having their basic services met like garbage disposal, heat and hot water. The last rally was on Nov. 3 demanding justice about the fire.
Avila, who is one of the tenants who has lived there the longest, says the living conditions worsened after the longtime landlord sold it to Alpha Capital Funds and then All is Good LLC. The property management company was Arlington Group LLC, and now is Mint Management Group LLC.
In total, the properties at 267 and 271 Wethersfield Ave. have 31 service requests for urgent and non-urgent maintenance issues. From heater and boiler failures, to roof leaks that freeze the stairs during the winter to door and window repairs.
Mint Management Group LLC said they responded to the maintenance requests.
“We had service issues and we addressed them, we sent our workers,” a representative of the company responded. “We feel so sorry for what happened, we feel bad for our tenants.”

Hartford’s public records show the management company, Mint Management Group LLC, has an incomplete rental license application. The direct legal landlord is Israel Wiznitzer, who also has an incomplete rental license application in Hartford.
Wiznitzer could not be reached for comment.
Cristian Corza-Godinez, spokesman for the City of Hartford, said an application is considered “complete” only upon the submittal of the application form with payment of the required fee for the license. If the fee is not paid, the application is considered “incomplete,” which means it’s not filed. Rental license applications are tracked through the city’s online software system. The owner is notified that the fee must be paid, as was done in the case of the owner of 267 Wethersfield Ave. on three occasions. A notice of violation for failure to apply for a rental license is the next step.
Sarah White, attorney for Connecticut Fair Housing Center, said the fines are placed on the building as a lien and can be prioritized over mortgages. The city could try to foreclose on the liens.
“The City of Hartford will continue to use every tool at our disposal to hold problematic landlords accountable for their actions, or lack thereof,” Corza-Godinez said in a statement. “Senior city officials have had ongoing conversations with the property owners of the affected building, and the City of Hartford’s Tenant Liaison has been on the ground having direct conversations with tenants to provide needed support. In a city where so many families rent their homes, Mayor Arulampalam and his administration will continue to push every landlord to meet their obligations to provide adequate housing for our residents.”
Owners who have not attempted to file an application have been issued notices of violation for any buildings with 10 or more units. Owners who applied incompletely will be receiving a notice of violation by Nov. 30, the city spokesman said.
“‘Are they waiting for our building to burn down?’ tenants told us last year, because for years we’ve been complaining about the way they’re maintaining this building, and it happened, it burned,” Quintana said.

The fallout
After the fire, the building was secured and labeled as unsafe. Tenants were told to not enter or it would be considered trespassing. But break-ins happened that weekend, according to neighbor Tangela Perry, who called the police.
Tenants were allowed to retrieve their belongings on Nov. 5, six days after the fire. A contractor, who declined to give his name, got hired by the management company to open up the building, which had wooden boards sealing off the entrances.
As tenants began to enter their apartments, they realized a lot of their family’s valuable belongings were gone. 
“All that, gone, that’s not replaceable,” said tenant Ronald Bozeman, referring to his parents’ jewelry.

When police arrived, the tenants reported their lost and stolen property.
“I used to be homeless. I used to couch surf. I worked so hard to get here. And nobody cares,” tenant Ryan Pirre said.
Those with no children expressed their emotions out loud more, compared to the those with children, who swallowed up their tears and just kept packing as the neighbors watched out for their sons and daughters playing in front of the apartment building. 
Avila was silent, as his daughter helped him pack his clothes. His video cassettes were still in a drawer, and a yellow envelope of his family photos laid on top of his bed.
“I wanted to cry, I felt that pain inside me, I wanted to cry, but nothing came out,” Avila said.
The tenants were told to retrieve their belongings from Wednesday, Nov. 5 until Friday, Nov 7. On Friday, Avila said he saw contractors demolishing parts of the building, while tenants were still moving out their belongings.
Mint Management LLC did not answer when asked for comment.

Displaced
Pirre lived at 271 Wethersfield Ave. for less than six months, and has had sleepless nights after the fire while staying in a motel with his girlfriend and three cats.
Through the Relocation Assistance Act, Pirre, like the rest of the unhoused tenants, have the right to relocation benefits from the city. They get emergency housing — like the motel Pirre was staying in for up to two weeks — temporary housing, storage, payment of moving expenses and up to $4,000 towards a new apartment.
The city’s resources might alleviate tenants’ immediate shelter concerns, but the trauma lingers.
“I woke up from a nightmare that the motel that I was in was burning and that I had to gather my cats again, that I had to get my girlfriend out of there,” Pirre said.

Days after the fire, Pirre was having a walk around Broad Street during his lunch break when he had a flashback of the fire in the middle of the day.
“There was another fire response happening at that exact moment, I just immediately had a super intense flashback of that moment of smelling wood burning and choking on the air and my eyes burning and thinking that I was going to die. I had to close my eyes, I had to just focus on my breathing,” Pirre recalls.
Avila says on the night of the fire he could not sleep due to chest pain and he thinks it’s because he inhaled smoke. He did not consider going to the hospital to get checked since he had asked for time off from his job, unpaid. All he could think about was his housing situation.
“I was still overwhelmed in my head thinking ‘well, I’ve lost my home and my memories,’ so I thought this chest pain would go away, and so far it has, thank God,” he said.

Quintana and Make the Road, along with the Connecticut Fair Housing Center, are meeting with the tenants regularly, to closely follow up their recovery efforts and ensure that their rights are respected.
Avila received the city’s notice that he can stay in a hotel for now and got the $4,000 of aid to get a new apartment, but says it’s not enough accountability.
“Whatever they can give us it’s useless if tomorrow there’s a fire in another building and a loss of life,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_WethersfieldAve_077-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 12:56:58.763843

Uthmeier stressed during a Brooksville press conference that Nathan Holmberg, accused of videoing the rape of five children under 12 in Hernando County — with more rapes suspected statewide — is an example of why the U.S. Supreme Court needs to reconsider the 2008 precedent at issue.

“[This is] nothing more than pure evil,” Uthmeier said, imploring Floridians who have information on Holmberg to contact his office. “Crimes like this against young children, where you take their innocence, you take their childhood away from them, these horrific acts deserve the ultimate form of justice.”
Holmberg was arrested on Oct. 20 after a “Good Samaritan” notified the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office that he had child pornography on his phone, according to county Sheriff Al Nienhuis. What authorities found was “one of the most heinous investigations,” Rita Peters — special counsel to the attorney general who’s worked in the sex crimes unit for more than 25 years — had ever seen.
Holmberg was indicted Monday by a Hernando grand jury on seven counts of sexual battery of a child under 12 years old, four counts of lewd and lascivious molestation of a child under 12 years old, three counts of lewd and lascivious conduct, and 10 counts of promoting a sexual performance by a child between December 2024 and Oct. 20, 2025 — the date he was arrested.
A nanny, babysitter, and worker at the local YMCA, Holmberg was also charged with 83 counts of possession of child pornography. He’s lived in Duval, Pasco, Pinellas, and Hernando counties over the past decade.
According to the partially redacted grand jury indictment, Holmberg took multiple videos of himself raping and coercing young children into sexual acts. The document paints a horrific picture of children between 3 and 10 years old wearing Jurassic Park, Minecraft, or Hello Kitty clothing as Holmberg molests them.
‘This is not an individual that can be rehabilitated’
Florida in 2023 passed landmark legislation expanding the state’s death penalty to include suspects who rape children younger than 12. It was the first law of its kind after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that executing child rapists was unconstitutional if the victim wasn’t killed.
That case, called Kennedy v. Louisiana, has been viewed as a massive roadblock for pro-death penalty advocates like Uthmeier, who’s made it his mission as attorney general to argue for severe penalties for child predators and to sue companies like Roblox and Snapchat for allegedly failing to prevent child molesters from communicating with kids.

“We believe that today’s Supreme Court should reevaluate and reinterpret the law to allow this form of justice. You have somebody that raped and sexually abused a three-year-old and filmed it. The evidence shows hundreds of files, photos, and videos of other child pornographic and abuse content,” Uthmeier said.
“Again, this is not an individual that can be rehabilitated, this is someone that needs to face the ultimate form of justice.”
Uthmeier in September led 15 states in asking U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to co-sign various state efforts to execute child rapists. Weeks after Uthmeier emailed his letter to Bondi, she joined President Donald Trump to announce planned expansions of the death penalty.
But these efforts haven’t been met with unanimous support. Maria DeLiberato, legal and policy director of Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, called Uthmeier’s efforts to overturn Kennedy v. Louisiana “unusual” and even harmful.
“They have lost sight of the fact that by seeking the death penalty in [child rape] cases, all they have accomplished is a guarantee for years and years of extensive and expensive litigation, an ongoing infliction of trauma to living child victims, and decades of uncertainty on appeal,” she said in a statement to the Phoenix. “The current punishment for these horrific allegations is already … a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.  
“It is also unusual for the attorney general himself to prosecute cases and use the resources of his office to do so when there is already a State Attorney’s Office with the necessary experience and funding to handle these types of complex prosecutions,” she added.
Florida’s child rape statute isn’t the only example of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ massive push to expand the death penalty. In 2023, DeSantis signed a law lowering the threshold for death penalty sentencing from a unanimous jury decision to an 8-4 supermajority. This year, he signed off on human trafficking as another crime worthy of execution and expanded the aggravated factors needed to recommend a death sentence.
Similarly, DeSantis has shattered Florida’s long-standing one-year record of eight executions set in 1984: in 2025 so far, he’s already scheduled 18 executions and conducted 15.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-12 17:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Legislature must act to further protect CT’s courts from ICE,"Peter Goselin, Chelsea Connery, and Sarah White",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/ctslegislature-must-act-to-further-protect-our-courts/,Connecticut’s lawmakers must recognize that barring arrests in courthouses has a long legal precedent.,"From the first days of President Trump’s second term in office, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have carried out raids in and around Connecticut courthouses. 
In August, ICE agents stormed a Stamford courthouse restroom to detain two immigrants who had come to court as victims of an armed robbery. At the same time, ICE detained 65 people, of whom less than half had any criminal charges or convictions, in the courthouse in Danbury. 
If members of the public cannot safely participate in legal proceedings, our access to justice is impaired. Recent new rules may help to limit disruptive and dangerous law enforcement actions in courthouses, but they do not go far enough to address the scope of the problem.
On September 16, Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins announced a new policy responding to disruptive efforts by ICE agents to detain people in Connecticut’s courthouses. The policy prohibits arrests in courthouses “except pursuant to a judicial warrant or order issued or signed by a judicial officer,” and prohibits law enforcement personnel from wearing masks. Although framed as applying to “law enforcement,” both provisions effectively limit ICE arrests in courthouses. ICE agents frequently rely on non-judicial “administrative” warrants to justify arrests, and are the only law enforcement agents – state or federal – to wear masks in the ordinary course of business.
Although the regulation responds to a seemingly new problem, it is grounded in a long history of English and American law. The policy of barring arrests on courthouse grounds was upheld in British courts in 18th century, and was endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 19th and early 20th century. Decisions prohibiting such arrests are rooted in a strong public interest in having people attend court proceedings, and in allowing courts to conduct their business without disruption.
At a time when there is a great deal of talk about immigrants “following the rules,” ICE activity at or in the vicinity of courthouses tells people that these are not safe places, even when the rules may require they appear in court. In addition to the obvious example of criminal defendants not attending trials – even when those trials may establish their innocence – the fear that keeps people out of courthouses means the absence of women bringing claims of domestic violence, of tenants challenging evictions, of plaintiffs seeking relief for injuries, and the unavailability of witnesses in all manner of proceedings.
A recent Supreme Court decision seemingly permits ICE to use racially-driven criteria like skin color and spoken language to determine if there is “reasonable cause” to believe someone is a non-citizen. As a result, ICE now freely stops and detains anyone who agents believe “looks like” someone who was not born in the U.S., whether the person is undocumented, has a green card, is seeking asylum – or turns out to be a U.S. citizen.
There are, however, practical steps that the legislature in special session can take to address these problems:

Strengthen the current language regarding judicial warrants. Require that such warrants be inspected by a judge before law enforcement can be admitted to a courthouse.


Increase use of remote proceedings. During the Covid-19 pandemic, people also had real reasons to fear going to court. Often the problem was solved by conducting hearings and even trials using remote videoconferencing. Courts need to make it easy for any litigant or their legal counsel to request remote proceedings.


Expand the mask ban and the warrant requirement. The new masking regulations announced by Chief Justice Mullins apply only “inside a courthouse,” but in Danbury people were accosted on the grounds of the courthouse and even inside the adjacent parking lot as they were coming and going from the courthouse. Especially in light of recent cases of ICE impersonators relying on masks to engage in criminal activities, state marshals should require that no one on courthouse grounds may wear a mask, and that warrants not be served on courthouse grounds unless or until inspected by a judge.


Ensure there is a mechanism for enforcement. When Chief Justice Mullins announced the new rules, he conceded that state marshals or other courthouse security personnel would not be able to prevent ICE agents that chose to ignore the new rules. While the question of state officers limiting the action of federal law enforcement in this very limited context is up for debate, there must be accountability. A measure adopted by the State of New York requires that court personnel make a report each time law enforcement conducts an arrest in the courthouse. Making such reports public and ensuring that ICE higher ups, the media, and the community aware of ICE agents’ activities is the first step toward accountability.

Connecticut’s lawmakers must recognize that barring arrests in courthouses has a long legal precedent. The proposed reforms would merely effectuate those precedents at a time when some federal law enforcement are determined to ignore them.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-12 17:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Expand funding for food assistance programs in CT,Maria G. Limon-Cerezo,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/12/expand-funding-for-food-assistance-programs-in-ct/,"Facing this winter without SNAP benefits will leave my family in a vulnerable position, making it difficult to ensure we have enough to eat.","My heart sank as I read the text message my parents asked me to translate for them. Although they understand some English, they wanted to make sure that they were reading the statement from the Department of Social Services correctly. 
Reading the text, The federal government announced that there will not be any new SNAP benefits in November, immediately triggered stress, fear, and a sense of vulnerability for both my parents and I.
The feeling of anxiety seemed familiar. I live with my parents and four siblings and we depend on SNAP and WIC for food security. Every winter, we always struggle to keep the fridge full as my dad is the only source of income in the family. His work in construction and home improvement slows down dramatically during the colder months, leaving us with less money to cover for basic needs. This winter, our access to food is even more important as we have recently been blessed with a young sibling. 


Facing this upcoming winter season without the SNAP benefits would leave us in an even more vulnerable position, making it incredibly difficult to ensure we have enough to eat or meet the additional needs of our growing family.
Since finding out that SNAP benefits will be cut, my mind has been racing with questions: How will we manage? What will we eat? Will we even eat? This lump in my throat has not gone away as I think about many other households that are in the exact same position as us. Just like my family, there are families that have been living paycheck-to-paycheck even before cuts to food-assistance programs were announced – in CT, about 391,000 people, roughly 10.6% of the state’s population, receive SNAP benefits each month. I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it can be for families to afford not just healthy meals but meals in general, especially during times of financial stress and recent food costs.

Maria G. Limon-Cerezo
It’s not just low income families with kids that are being affected by this. The elderly, especially those retired, people with disabilities, and people with chronic illnesses are part of this community as well.
Even brief periods without enough nutritious food can be life-threatening. Many individuals with diet-related conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease depend on SNAP benefits to afford the healthy foods they need to stay well. Because these benefits are now unavailable, these individuals will now have to turn to cheaper options which are usually highly processed options or will even have to skip meals. Both options are just as bad for their health.
Although food insecurity is present in every community, some parts of Connecticut have a higher rate than others. According to Feeding America, a non-profit organization, they’ve noticed that residents from Greater Bridgeport, South Central Connecticut, Naugatuck Valley, Capitol Region, and Southeastern Connecticut have food insecurity rates higher than the state average, while lower northeastern CT have significantly lower rates than the state average. Data also shows that Black/African American and Hispanic/Latine families have a higher rate for facing food insecurity than that of White families not just in Connecticut, but nationwide. Part of the reason includes uneven food access.
Because food banks expect increased demand in Connecticut, I think the state can consider a larger funding program until federal funds resume to expand distribution sites, increase mobile pantries, and partner with local stores to accept emergency vouchers. In fact, Governor Ned Lamont has already called a special legislative session to decide whether Connecticut will fill the gaps for SNAP recipients, proposing to use up to $500 million in reserve funds to ensure families continue receiving food assistance through the federal shutdown. 
However, Connecticut’s leaders should also take action on the federal level. While state efforts are essential to support residents during challenging times, it’s equally important for these leaders to use their platform to advocate for national change. They should push for the federal government to resume funding for food assistance programs, establish contingency plans to prevent future shutdown disruptions, and ensure that vital programs like SNAP remain protected for those who rely on them most.
Governor Lamont’s plan to hold a special legislative session and potentially use reserve funds shows that the state leaders recognize the urgency of this crisis. However, even before calling this session, he had already taken an initial step by allocating $3 million in emergency state funding to the nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare to bolster food-pantries across the state. 
While this is a meaningful gesture, this isn’t enough compared to what other state governors are offering. For instance, in Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin immediately declared a state of emergency in late October by launching the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance (VENA) to ensure food benefits would continue for residents suffering from the shutdown of federal support for programs like SNAP. This will allow the state to issue $37.5 million a week from the state surplus via existing EBT cards.
This government shutdown is no longer a political event. It is directly threatening the well-being of families like mine and many others who rely on these benefits for daily nourishment. Food is a basic necessity, it shouldn’t be a privilege.

Julie Bonney is a longtime, Kodiak Island-based representative of some of Alaska’s trawlers — a type of fishing boat that’s drawn increasing criticism over the years for accidental “bycatch” of salmon, halibut and other species. Last week, Bonney was returning from a trip off the island when Alaska state troopers seized her mobile phone and work laptop. The day before, investigators searched the offices of Bonney’s member-based business, the Alaska Groundfish Data Bank, and  seized all of its electronics.Bonney was not arrested and no charges have been filed. But troopers, over the weekend, confirmed an active investigation into allegations that “multiple seafood processors” had been illegally profiting from salmon and halibut bycatch — further fueling scrutiny of an industry that’s already under attack.
“I think everybody’s interested in what’s happening with trawl, essentially because of the hypocrisy,” said David Bayes, a longtime advocate and moderator of the 47,000-member “STOP Alaskan Trawler Bycatch” Facebook group, who flagged the investigation for reporters.
Everyday Alaskans, Bayes noted, can be charged with wanton waste for leaving a single salmon on a riverbank, while trawlers operating in the North Pacific and Bering Sea are legally allowed tens of millions of pounds of accidental harvests each year. The trawlers are typically targeting whitefish like pollock, which is processed into fish pies, filets, fish sticks and fish paste for markets in Asia, Europe and the United States.
The troopers investigation appears to center on processors, not the trawl vessels, as the vessels don’t get paid for their bycatch when it’s dropped off at processors’ plants.
Federal management officials say that processors subsequently sending the trawl bycatch to a meal plant would conflict with a federal regulation barring the fish from being “sold, purchased, bartered, or traded.”
The Kodiak meal plant’s use of the bycatch, industry officials say, was not a secret: Bonney had testified publicly about it last month at a meeting of a federal management board, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.
At the meeting, Bonney said that Kodiak processors have been sending bycatch not fit for charitable donation to the meal plant for more than three decades, under guidance from federal managers that explicitly allows the practice.

She said the amount of bycatch processed at the meal plant is a very small share of the plant’s total volume, less than 1%. Last year’s cap on the number of king salmon that could be taken as bycatch by trawlers in the central Gulf of Alaska, the area fished by the Kodiak fleet, was 18,316, while the total salmon harvest that year exceeded 9.5 million fish.
Federal officials only notified industry in August that the practice was no longer allowed, Bonney said.
Bonney, reached by phone Monday, declined to comment. In a note to membersobtained by Northern Journal, a colleague at the Alaska Groundfish Data Bank said the business “does not have anything to hide.”
Paddy O’Donnell, the skipper of a Kodiak-based trawler, said that law enforcement officials were taking a heavy-handed approach that singles out trawlers when processors may also have allowed bycatch from other types of vessels to be turned into fish meal.
“It’s like cocaine wars — but it’s not. It’s such a minute amount,” he said. “It is an industry-wide issue, and it’s to do with the processors and the reporting mechanism.”
A troopers spokesman, Austin McDaniel, said in an emailed statement that the search of Bonney’s business involved allegations that “large volumes” of commercial bycatch including halibut and salmon “were unlawfully entered into commerce by multiple seafood processors.”
State law and federal regulations ban the sale or commercial use of bycatch “to protect sensitive species, ensure sustainable management of Alaska’s fisheries, and preserve fairness within the commercial fishing industry,” he added.
McDaniel declined to say whether the investigation centered on the processing of bycatch into fish meal.
But a copy of the four-page search warrant obtained by Northern Journal said that the troopers were looking for records related to bycatch, “fishmeal operations, or coordination with processors and regulators,” as well those “showing Ms. Bonney’s personal involvement in shaping, editing, or endorsing compliance positions later used by (processing companies) to justify commercial activity” involving bycatch.
The warrant said troopers were searching for evidence of the crime of a “scheme to defraud,” a felony. It’s the second major fisheries related investigation in Kodiak this year, after a prominent commercial salmon fisherman and local school board member, Duncan Fields, and multiple family members were charged with illegal permit transfers in April.
Officials with Kodiak’s major processing companies either declined to comment or didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The business that operates the Kodiak meal plant, Kodiak Fishmeal Co., declined to comment on the specifics of the investigation through an Anchorage-based attorney, Michelle Nesbett. Nesbett said in an email that the company is “aware of the investigation and is cooperating fully with authorities.”
Kodiak Fishmeal Co. does not appear in state corporate registries, though in the past, regulators have described it as being cooperatively owned by several fish processing plants on the island.
Industry representatives said the desire to dispose of the bycatch as fish meal stems from convenience, not profit motive, given the relatively low market value of meal — typically less than a dollar a pound at wholesale prices.
O’Donnell, the trawl skipper, said that while the investigation plays out, vessels are now hauling their bycatch away from processing plants and throwing it back in the open ocean. The trawlers are required to dump the bycatch at least three miles offshore, which O’Donnell described as a time-consuming and inconvenient process.
While anti-bycatch advocates have been using the troopers investigation as an opportunity to question trawlers’ fishing practices, O’Donnell noted that, under a federal program, his boat’s harvests, and those of nearly all of the other Kodiak-based trawlers, are continuously recorded by onboard cameras.
“We have accountability,” he said.
Bayes, the bycatch critic, said that the trawlers “don’t get any pity from me” for having to return their unintended harvests to the waters of the North Pacific — adding that he thinks the fish are better off decomposing in the ocean environment than sold as meal to distant markets.
“They’re supposed to be doing everything they can to avoid it in the first place,” he said.

Digital white hearts float above her head. (Photo provided)Kwanita Allen was just 4 years old when she left home and walked to the neighbor’s house with a plea: “Can you help me find my mommy? She always leaves us.” 
This is the memory that sticks strongest with her: “Ask me anytime, any day, I am always going to remember. I’m never going to forget it,” said Allen, 25. “The parental bond is not one that you want severed or tampered with, especially early when you’re developing.” 
That night sent her on a life path she describes as “back and forth” and filled with uncertainty, as social workers became a regular part of her life. 
And now, the longest-ever federal government shutdown has thrust her into even more uncertainty. Allen has a disability and gets federal food assistance to buy groceries while she goes to college and lives in a Louisville subsidized housing unit at Family Scholar House.   
Her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit — $23 a month — has also been frozen during the ongoing federal government shutdown. Even though it’s not much, losing that “simple dusting — a little trickle” of help sent her to food banks in search of meat and pantry staples she can use to feed herself. 
“I’m not gonna resort to anything undemure, lose my dignity,” Allen said. But accessing food during this shutdown as someone who lives in the middle of the city, much less nutritious food, is a constant challenge, she said. “The fresh stuff that you would want to eat and that’s good for your body is nowhere around me.” 
Much of Louisville’s ZIP codes are in food deserts, meaning full grocery stores aren’t accessible, limiting access to fresh and nutritious food for some.

Sarah Brady, the president of Family Scholar House Works, the parent organization  of Family Scholar House, said the majority of residents in the nonprofit’s Section 8 housing have SNAP benefits. When the government shut down, Family Scholar House preemptively stocked the shelves of its campus food pantry to better feed the immediate community. 
Using federal, state and organizational grants and donor funding, Family Scholar House is “very much an educational program with a housing component,” Brady said. 
“We know that more often than not it’s not actually going to school or doing the school work that stops someone,” she said. “It’s life that gets in the way. It’s unstable housing and child care and transportation and food insecurity and all the things, whether you’re dropping out to take care of a family member, or to get an extra job to be able to provide for your family — whatever that may look like for each individual situation.” 
Because of that, residents have advocates they meet regularly to coach them through school, budgeting their SNAP benefit, managing health. Residents also have opportunities to learn about financial literacy, home ownership, cooking and much more. 
“It’s really an intentional program with a lot of wraparound services to meet the needs, but to also help them really, truly, overcome barriers that they’ve experienced and work through trauma that they may have experienced, rather than just putting a band aid on it,” Brady said. 
Most residents — around 97% — have experienced some level of trauma, Brady said. 
‘I lived that life’  
The neighbor Allen walked to for help at age 4 called Child Protective Services and she left home that night to live with her father. 
Even though she stayed with family, social workers were now a regular part of her life as she navigated neglect at an early age.

“People came to talk to you with their suits and their briefcases and their papers,” she recalled. “And they’re flipping their pens and asking you questions about the current home you’re living in… trying to weigh: is the other parent better?” 
She took turns living with her parents and their partners. She worked to find herself, participaing in ROTC in high school and, at 19, she joined the Army but soon realized there was “an internal problem” with her body. During basic training, she learned she had pinched nerves, sciatica and scoliosis when trying to run and do pushups through immense pain. 
She was eventually discharged over the disabilities and had to come up with a new plan for life.  
“It’s hard to know what you’re successful at, know what you can achieve, when all your whole life’s been back and forth,” Allen said. “You see others’ stability, and then you better have stability.” 
Allen is now studying at the Jefferson Community and Technical College in Louisville with hopes of being a human resources professional. She’s also a part-time advocate for foster-involved youth through several organizations because, she said, she wants people who grew up as  part of the child protective system “to know they’re not alone.” 
“I lived that life for real,” Allen said. “I fit those shoes at one time.” 
‘These benefits do help’ 
Once the government reopens, people could still see delays in getting food assistance: The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed a freeze on SNAP to continue. 
Even when the government shutdown ends, Allen said, there is work to do to end the stigma of getting food assistance and other help: “Defying the stigma of ‘we’re using this to be lazy and not work,’” she said. 
“These benefits do help people,” she said. “I didn’t just throw the food away. I didn’t just look at it. I made food with that — that is how I ate for the night. That’s important. Food is a pivotal thing.” 
There is “some stigma” still around needing public assistance, Brady with Family Scholar House said, but programs like hers are “a stepping stone” to a productive future. 
“Our graduates are buying homes; they’re doctors of nursing practice; they’re lawyers; they’re all of these different things, and they have to have help doing it,” she said. “So many of our participants are in a generational cycle of poverty and really being able to kind of have that courage to be the one that’s going to step up and break that cycle for your family is very hard.” 
Family Scholar House has five residential campuses providing housing for 279 families; 32 of its residents are young adults who have aged out of the foster care system. 
“Those people are all trying to do the right thing,” Brady said. “They’re all enrolled in some sort of postsecondary education or working or doing both, and they are just doing everything they can to survive and break that cycle for their family.”

You can read more about the section here.

There’s a tone many of us recognize in our bones. Not outrage. Not apathy. It’s that faded, sepia-toned feeling – the sense of standing just offstage while the rest of the country barrels past in red or blue. You care, but you don’t quite belong.
That’s where millions of Americans live. Nearly 80 million eligible adults didn’t vote in the last presidential election. These aren’t people who don’t care. Many simply don’t feel spoken for by either party or the culture at large.
What we hear again and again, here in Mississippi and beyond, is this: Most people genuinely want what’s best. They just disagree – sometimes fiercely – on what that looks like.
Philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre warned decades ago that our moral arguments have grown hollow because we’ve lost the shared frameworks that once gave them meaning. Words like freedom and justice still circulate, but we no longer agree on what they mean.

Psychologist Jonathan Haidt explains why: People weigh values differently. One person hears “choice” and thinks freedom. Another hears “choice” and worries about fairness. Both are moral positions — just spoken in different languages.
You see it on the ground here. At a recent Leland City Council meeting, one group argued that a family shouldn’t live in a collapsing house without running water. Safety and liability demanded action. Another group insisted removing the family would cause deeper harm, because even a dangerous house was still shelter. Both sides were trying to do the right thing. They just couldn’t agree on what “right” looked like.
You see it at the Capitol in Jackson. The school-choice debate pits parents’ desire for options against public schools’ plea for resources. Both sides want opportunity for children. But one defines it as freedom to choose, the other as fairness in access.
And you see it in Washington, where Congress once again failed its central duty of passing a budget. For nearly half a century, lawmakers have rarely met that deadline. The American people are rightly frustrated. But underneath the dysfunction is the same issue – a translation failure between competing visions of “best.”
Have we built our fences so high – political, cultural, even literal – that we can no longer see the beauty on the other side?
Here in Mississippi, that question matters. We know how high the stakes are. One in four of our children grows up in poverty. Our ACT averages lag the nation. Yet we also know what’s possible. The “Mississippi Miracle” in early literacy showed the nation that bold investment, bipartisan policy and shared commitment can move the needle for kids.
We don’t need perfect agreement to do it again. But we do need recognition that our neighbors, even the ones we spar with, are usually trying to do the right thing. Moral humility – not certainty – may be the only way forward.
Mississippi has a chance to lead by example. That means demanding transparency and results in every school, whether public, private or charter. It means protecting both individual rights and community responsibilities. And it means refusing to let ideological corners dictate the fate of children who need every adult at the table.
We’re not enemies. We’re just holding different maps. And maybe, if we stop mistaking translation failure for moral failure, we’ll realize we’re all still steering toward what’s best.

Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican, speaking at a hearing in the House Education Policy and Administration Committee, which he chaired, Nov. 5, 2025. (Screenshot/New Hampshire General Court)Republican Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a longtime advocate for school choice and the chairman of the Education Policy and Administration Committee, has resigned from the New Hampshire House, according to the clerk’s office.
Cordelli, of Tuftonboro, was included in an updated list posted by House Clerk Paul Smith Wednesday that names representatives who have resigned or died since the November 2024 election.
The reason for his resignation was not immediately clear. 
Since becoming a representative in 2013, Cordelli has been a prolific sponsor of legislation to expand alternatives to public education. He was one of the earliest and loudest proponents of New Hampshire’s education freedom account program, which passed in 2021 after years of efforts by Cordelli to get support from then-Gov. Chris Sununu and fellow Republican lawmakers.
He was the face of many efforts to impose tighter state control over the content taught at public schools. That included bills to give parents greater power to challenge books and materials deemed obscene.
And Cordelli had appeared to be leading many of those efforts into the 2026 session. Earlier this month, he pushed forward an amendment intended to revive a bill vetoed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte that would allow for easier removal of books from schools.
He was also the prime author of legislation presented last week that would allow the State Board of Education to take control of school districts determined to be in a financial crisis or to be violating state rules. Presenting the bill last week, Cordelli cited the ongoing fiscal crisis in the Claremont School District as the impetus for that legislation, which would allow the board to appoint an administrator to take over a school district for up to a year.
Frequently sporting a yellow scarf to symbolize the school choice movement, Cordelli was a regular presence on the House floor in support of education freedom accounts, charter schools, and homeschooled students.
Speaking in favor of a bill to expand the education freedom account program in February 2024, Cordelli encapsulated that lifelong view. 
“School choice programs have the best form of accountability,” he said. “Parents can walk when they’re not happy with their kids’ education. In public schools, what happens if the school is failing? They get more money.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Glenn-Cordelli-1024x534.png,,,2025-11-12 12:01:17.757759

The Tennessee Department of Human Services said in a news release that SNAP recipients who were expected to receive their payment during the first 12 days of November would receive that partial payment Wednesday. 
Recipients who receive their payments later in the month will also receive 65% of their benefit. The department news release said if they are directed to provide the full payment at a later date officials will. 
As the federal government shutdown dragged into November, President Donald Trump’s administration decided to withhold all SNAP payments. The program to help feed the state’s poorest residents covers about 700,000 Tennesseans and costs $145 million a month. 
The SNAP funding freeze led to a surge in demand for local food banks and impacted residents all across the state. 
On Sunday, the U.S. Senate passed a funding bill that is expected to end the 54-day government shutdown. The U.S. House will take up the funding bill Wednesday.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/The Minnesota Reformer)A provision in the federal government’s shutdown-ending spending package would be a massive setback to Minnesota’s hemp-derived THC industry if it were to pass.
Although the federal government isn’t likely to start kicking down doors seizing low-dose THC edibles and drinks, a new federal law against hemp-derived THC products would create new logistical hurdles for the burgeoning industry and could cripple what has become a $140 million retail segment that’s even found its way inside Target liquor stores.
The provision was championed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, who sparred with Sen. Rand Paul — his Kentucky GOP colleague — over the section that reverses the inadvertent legalization of hemp-derived THC in the 2018 Farm Bill.
In an effort to encourage more industrial hemp for commercial use, the 2018 Farm Bill took hemp off of the controlled-substance list and defined hemp to be any cannabis plant or product with 0.3% or less of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the psychoactive drug from the plant.
Turns out, that’s enough to make products to get people high.
Along with a 2022 law from the Minnesota Legislature, the 2018 bill created a legal gray area for intoxicating hemp-derived THC products and paved the way for Minnesota’s THC beverage and edibles industry.
McConnell led the 2018 hemp effort and now wants to close the “loophole” that’s allowed for a hemp-derived THC industry to flourish as part of his agriculture policy legacy before retiring next year, Politico reported. The new prohibition introduces a cap of 0.4mg of THC per container, effectively banning intoxicating THC drinks and edibles, which, even at the lowest doses, have at least 2mg of THC.
A coalition of 39 attorneys general, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, wrote a letter to key members of Congress in which they urged a rollback of the 2018 law: “Clear direction from Congress is needed to shut down this industry before it metastasizes further into an even greater threat to public safety than it already is.”
The industry currently has little federal regulation, leading to states adopting a patchwork of laws on hemp-derived products. In 2022, Minnesota passed a bill permitting the manufacture, distribution and sale of 5mg drinks and edibles to adults over 21, making it the “leader in launching the THC beverage revolution,” said Jason Tarasek, a cannabis lawyer at Vicente LLP. Among other safety regulations, the products can’t be marketed to children, and Minnesota retailers must obtain a license to sell it.
Paul objected to McConnell’s outright hemp ban, calling it “the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I’ve seen in a long, long time.” Most senators sided with McConnell, however — on Monday, the U.S. Senate voted 76-24 to set aside Paul’s amendment to reverse the provision, passing the hemp ban provision, along with the rest of the government funding bill, to the House to vote on as soon as Wednesday.
The provision, if it passes, will go into effect in a year, giving suppliers a chance to sell off their product.
Hemp-derived THC products are sold in liquor stores, breweries and other retail shops, making them a popular choice for consumers who don’t want to buy on the black market or venture into dispensaries now selling recreational weed.
“People who would never rip a bong are more comfortable with the low dosage,” Tarasek said.
Steven Brown is the CEO of Nothing But Hemp, the largest low-dose THC hemp supplier in the state, according to the company’s website. Brown said that his customer base for his physical retail stores, who are mainly 55 years or older, “don’t want to step into a dispensary.”
“They want to walk in and have a normal retail experience, like going to a liquor store or going into a hemp shop,” Brown said.
The federal hemp ban, which reverts hemp to the same federal status as cannabis, would effectively shut down the industry if it passes and holds up over time. Even if the federal government largely left states alone when it comes to regulating hemp, as it does with cannabis currently, the ban would create problems that would make the hemp industry virtually unviable, business owners said.
The Minnesota low-dose hemp business would become more like its cousin the cannabis industry, which is legal in two dozen states but remains federally illegal, creating a raft of business complications.
For one, liquor stores and breweries that sell THC products would have to pay significantly higher taxes, thanks to a section in the federal tax code that forbids businesses from selling illegal substances and also getting tax deductions on their business expenses. They’d also be unable to work with credit card companies or many banks, limitations which have forced cannabis dispensaries to largely use cash.
“There will be a number of breweries that will close their doors,” said Bob Galligan of the Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild.
Also, since hemp-derived THC comes from immature cannabis plants with more non-THC biomass, it’s less efficient to produce compared to cannabis. Federal legalization made hemp less of a headache to deal with compared to higher-potency weed, Galligan said, but a federal ban on hemp would reverse that calculation.
“The THC category we started two and a half years ago, it’s grown to be approaching 15% of our overall business,” said Jon Halper, owner of Top Ten Liquors, which Halper said is one of the top two hemp-derived THC retailers in Minnesota. Halper attributes Top Ten’s sales growth this year to those THC sales.
Halper said he would have to pull out of selling THC drinks and edibles if the ban goes through, and expects virtually all liquor stores to do the same.
“Most of the brands are going to go out of business because they’re not going to have places to sell,” Halper said. “The industry will just crumble overnight.”
Five alcohol trade organizations sent a letter echoing Ellison and the other 38 attorneys general, though a slew of alcohol wholesalers followed that letter with their own denouncing a prohibition, calling instead for federal regulation. For the most part, alcohol retailers and wholesalers support the hemp industry, but alcohol producers are more split, said Halper.
Ellison seemed unaware of the possibly industry-ending impact of federal prohibition.
“Even before Minnesota legalized cannabis, our state legalized the sale of certain edibles containing THC derived from hemp – as long as those edibles follow important consumer protection and quality-control standards,” Ellison said in a Substack post. “I support this law, and I am not seeking to restrict the sale of products that follow the law in any way.”
But a federal prohibition on hemp would indeed severely restrict the sale of hemp products that are legal in Minnesota, industry experts said.
They aren’t all doom-and-gloom yet, however, holding out for the possibility of a potent political backlash.
The provision “may incentivize reform because there’s a huge nationwide industry that this is going to kill,” Tarasek said. “When there’s that much money and that much consumer interest in these products, I just don’t think they’re going to go quietly.”
Brown added: “We’re still in the fight.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5588-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 12:01:17.757759

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)If South Dakota is awarded the $1 billion it’s seeking from a new federal rural health fund, half of that money will be used to modernize telehealth and data-sharing efforts.
All 50 states applied to the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes. 
According to KFF, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas in South Dakota over the next decade will decrease by a projected $487 million, due largely to new work requirements in the federal law that will cause some people to lose coverage.
Half of the Rural Health Transformation Program — $25 billion — will be distributed equally to states with approved applications, regardless of each state’s proportion of rural hospitals or population. That means South Dakota will receive at least $500 million, if approved.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The remaining half will be allocated based on the number of rural residents and rural health facilities in a state, as well as the state’s spending plans and policies, among other factors. Applications will be approved by the end of the year.
A key component of South Dakota’s application is a $500 million health infrastructure modernization proposal, which would include creation of a “South Dakota Health Data Atlas.” It would allow health care systems throughout the state to access health data in one “single, accessible platform.” The atlas would address telecommunications needs, equipment, emergency preparedness and cybersecurity concerns.
“The Rural Data Atlas will enable outcome tracking at the community level, allowing providers and health departments to identify gaps, target interventions and measure impact,” the proposal said. 
The modernization effort, including grants for providers, would expand health providers’ use of electronic health records and telehealth platforms in the state.
About 77% of the state’s critical access hospitals are in eastern South Dakota, with western communities facing up to 120 miles one-way to reach care. Because of that, the application focuses heavily on regionalization, prevention, and technology and self-monitoring efforts.
In addition to the modernization effort, South Dakota’s application includes the following proposals.
Sustainability grants
$125 million to fund grants incentivizing South Dakota health care providers to explore regional assessments and partnerships to “strengthen coordination and sustainability.” Providers could also use the grants to improve professional and management services that could impact a facility’s bottom line.
Such partnerships will “drive sustainable improvements” and “allow hospitals and clinics to coordinate services, offer complementary care, and achieve measurable quality gains and strengthen financial stability,” the proposal said.
Emergency Medical Services regionalization
$64 million to incentivize the creation of regional emergency medical service hubs to reduce response times and offer professional development and improved technology. The state has already dedicated millions of dollars toward technology upgrades for emergency medical services, and issued a report on emergency medical service sustainability recommendations in recent years.
South Dakota officials hope funding for the effort will improve emergency response times and increase the emergency medical services workforce by 15% over the next two years.
New Medicaid payment model
$62.6 million to support a new Medicaid payment model that would provide more predictable revenue to health care systems, reward quality and allow facilities to maintain comprehensive services in rural areas of the state.
Recruit rural health professionals
$62.5 million to provide recruitment incentives, such as sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance and rural service stipends, to remove barriers and make rural health care positions more competitive. The program would include five-year sign-on commitments for the incentives and expand apprenticeship programs. State officials hope to recruit 500 rural professionals by 2030.
Certified community behavioral health clinics
South Dakota does not have any certified community behavioral health clinics in the state, which provide mental health and substance use services to anyone who seeks them, regardless of insurance or their ability to pay. 
Using $56.4 million, the state would establish at least one health clinic in each of the state’s behavioral health regions to improve access to care statewide. The initiative would also establish one mobile crisis team and one crisis stabilization facility per region to reduce emergency room visits and jail holds.
Chronic disease management
$45 million to improve chronic disease management across the state. That would include funding rural health care providers, pharmacies and schools to implement chronic disease management and interventions. It would also include improving remote patient monitoring technology use, such as implementing a blood pressure monitoring program and management workshops throughout the state, and offering more resources and support to caregivers in the state.
Establish regional maternal and infant health hubs
$24 million to analyze maternal health gaps — service shortages, social services and supports, workforce needs, and regulatory and payment barriers — and then fund three health care entities to create regional maternal health hubs. The hubs would use a combination of telehealth and remote monitoring technologies in addition to in-person visits to address transportation and accessibility issues in rural and tribal areas of the state.
Create a health care training and resource hub
$4.7 million to provide physicians, nurses, community health workers, emergency medical service providers, doulas and other health care workers with online training and events. Some training would be specific to rural needs — including behavioral health, telehealth, chronic disease prevention, and maternal and child health.
Strengthen community health worker numbers
$3.5 million to support the growth of community health workers in the state’s health care system, including helping with Medicaid claims and creating Medicare billing pathways for the providers. South Dakota has 180 certified community health workers, who help patients navigate health care systems due to language or cultural barriers, and the state hopes to increase that to 300 by 2030.

Democrat Jordan Wood has switched from running to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to instead vie for Democrat U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s now-open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
After Golden announced he would not be seeking reelection last week, Wood confirmed to Maine Morning Star on Wednesday that he will instead run in that election. Wood, a former congressional aide who spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., currently lives in Bristol, which is not located in the 2nd Congressional District he’s now running to represent. He grew up in CD2, in Lewiston and Gardiner. 
On the Democratic side, Wood joins Maine State Auditor Matt Dunlap, who had launched a primary bid against Golden before the representative left the race. Little-known Louis Sigel, a former secretary for the Kennebec County Democratic Committee, is also running. Former Gov. Paul LePage is expected to be the Republican nominee, with no others yet running in that primary.
As a candidate for Senate, Wood had been campaigning across the state pitching himself as the one to replace Collins, but he did not garner nearly as much attention as Graham Platner, the oyster farmer and military veteran who made a splashy campaign launch in August. Wood called for Platner to drop out after reporting revealed controversial comments he’d made on Reddit in the past and his now-covered tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol. 
Before returning to Maine in 2021, Wood had worked as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California. He co-founded and previously served as executive director of democracyFIRST, a pro-democracy organization dedicated to combating growing threats to the free and fair administration and certification of elections. Wood also previously served as vice president of End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Campaign Act.

The Tower Hill Hillers defeated the St. Mark’s Spartans, 3-0, November 10, to earn their third state championship title in the last four years. 
 
NEWARK — Tower Hill was a point away from earning its second consecutive state championship as the ball crossed over the net and onto the Hillers’ side of the court. Through the final moments of set three, Tower Hill seemed focused on getting the ball to the left side of its attack. The side where junior Sydney Fischer resided.  
The final play of the Hillers’ victory started with a pass from senior Lily Leung to setter Parker Lewicki who set up Fischer drifting from the far left toward the middle of the court. Fischer leaped and swung her right arm hitting the ball with a fury that resulted in her 15th and final kill of the game, along with a state championship trophy. 
Fischer scored three of the Hillers’ final five points in their 25-21 third set victory helping Tower Hill defeat St. Mark’s, 3-0, at the Bob Carpenter Center, Monday night.
“I just kind of like remember, like, this is what all the work’s for. This is what I’ve been working towards all season and it’s just like that adrenaline rush,” Fischer said postgame of her closing performance. “[It’s a] do it for your team kind of thing, like play for something bigger.”
Fischer and sophomore Cadence Davis were a dynamic duo on the outside pacing the team with 15 kills each in the championship match, but it was the play of the Hillers’ middles that provided the duo with significant support. The middle trio of Danielle Soleye, Kennedy Haskins and Madison Squire combined for 14 kills scoring points off quick tips at the middle of the net.  
“That’s what we talked about the whole time. We talked about support not just being words of support, but actions of support where, you know, we’re making good decisions,” Tower Hill head coach Michael Sachs said postgame. “Those things are huge, and I think because they look at it as supporting their teammates, I think they focus on it more and were really successful.” 
The Hillers were successful all season winning all but one regular season game. The lone loss was to Garnet Valley High School in Pennsylvania. Against in-state competition Tower Hill was undefeated. The team carried their strong regular season performance into the postseason sweeping every opponent they faced. 
The Spartans provided a strong challenge for the Hillers in the championship game never trailing by more than six points in any set. Sachs complimented the Spartans ability to execute their system and the abilities of the Spartans’ middles to attack their defense with tips.
“Their middles do a really nice job tipping,” said Sachs. “We were preparing for those tips and they still scored a lot with us on those tips, but that was a lot of what it was, was they just did their system well.”
Following the game, Sachs said the championship win was a fulfilling experience because of the players ability to step up and embrace new roles before and during the season. The ability for the team to come together was aided by veteran leaders like libero Lily Leung whose experience helped ease the transition for her younger teammates.
“I think that really being there for your team and like telling them that ‘Hey, I’ve been there too, everyone has been through that’ just really helps out and allows everyone to come together,” Leung said.
As for what she’ll remember from this championship season …

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board, announced the latest effort in a Wednesday press release. Hansen said the move was prompted by “recent acts of political violence in nearby states and across the country” but listed no specific incidents motivating the decision.

Just this year, there have been multiple incidents of violence against state lawmakers across the U.S., including a fatal shooting of a Minnesota legislator, and a fire-bombing at the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion.
“The state Capitol is the people’s house,” Hansen said in the release. “We are dedicated to ensuring that all Nebraskans can enjoy it safely and participate fully in our political process.”
Nebraska’s Capitol is secured by in-house security officers through the Nebraska State Patrol, as well as cameras throughout the building. Hansen did not specify what other measures the Legislature is interested in implementing.
Other government buildings in Nebraska, including courthouses and local government offices, use metal detectors and offer fewer public entrances compared to the Capitol.
Hansen said the Legislature has been working with Capitol security and the other two branches of Nebraska state government also housed in the Capitol to determine what additional security measures are warranted.
Those conversations are ongoing, he said.
Hansen’s press release did not specify the estimated cost of such security measures. Budget constraints are poised to be a large focus of the 2026 session, as lawmakers are tasked with filling a projected budget hole that currently stands at an estimated $451 million.
Although any building-wide security changes approved by lawmakers during the 2026 session would not be implemented until at least 2027, Hansen said, the Legislature may take independent steps to enhance the security of legislative proceedings before then.
Hansen said the public should be prepared for possible security-related changes to legislative procedures in the upcoming session, scheduled to begin Jan. 7.

“No matter how well-intentioned or long-overdue, the result of the 126th General Assembly’s increase in in-district compensation without either limiting language in the proviso or delaying implementation of the increase to the seating of the 127th General Assembly is to increase its own compensation, which our state constitution expressly prohibits,” the opinion reads.
All five justices signed onto the eight-page order.
The state constitution makes it clear that legislators can’t raise their own salary, justices wrote. Instead, any salary increase must go into effect after an election, in this case at least January 2027.
The constitution says nothing about reimbursements to cover official expenses. But the budget clause included nothing limiting how legislators could spend the funds, which are separate from the $10,400 annual salary legislators receive.
In passing the budget clause, senators argued they needed a raise to keep up with inflation causing other expenses to rise. Justices wrote that legislators have every right to increase the amount they can receive to reimburse official costs but added the clause didn’t do that.
“It cannot be denied that, over the past century, legislative service has evolved considerably from what it once was, essentially requiring year-round service both in and outside of the legislative session,” the opinion reads. “The increased demands of modern legislative service naturally could lead the General Assembly to appropriate a greater amount of public funds to reimburse legislators for official expenses incurred in carrying out their official duties.”
Sen. Wes Climer, a Rock Hill Republican, filed the lawsuit soon after the legislative session ended. He was one of 44 Republicans to opt out of the raise.
“I think this shows that Sen. Climer showed tremendous courage in bringing this lawsuit and held his fellow legislators’ feet to the fire on this obviously illegal act,” his attorney and former Sen. Dick Harpootlian said.

(Photo by Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas turned in a 60-page application last week in hopes of receiving a share of  $50 billion in federal money designed to transform rural health. 
Nearly one-third of Kansans live in rural communities, and the state’s Rural Health Transformation Plan aims to improve health in those areas. 
Federal government officials originally touted the $50 billion as support for rural hospitals that are set to lose billions of dollars after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut Medicaid and other federal health spending. But the program evolved into a more general focus on rural health.
The Kansas plan was developed in two months after the federal government set a tight timeline for submissions to receive a portion of $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. 
Of that amount, $25 billion will be distributed evenly among the states selected and the remaining $25 billion will be allocated based on submitted plans, said Kate Sapra, deputy secretary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of Rural Health Transformation. The money will be paid out over five budget periods, from federal fiscal year 2026 through federal fiscal year 2030. 
Sapra spoke at a September meeting to the team Gov. Laura Kelly appointed to develop the Kansas application, called the Kansas Rural Health Innovation Alliance. The coalition of government, nonprofit and private organizations, including the Kansas Hospital Association, the Association of Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas and the Kansas Association of Local Health Departments.
The Kansas plan focuses on improving health delivery systems, encouraging innovative care models and using innovative technologies, according to the 60-page application submitted last week.
Martie Ross, director of PYA Center for Rural Health Advancement, Overland Park, told the group at its October meeting that they had condensed a yearlong process into six weeks. 
“If I had a piece of advice for Congress, … I would have said please give us at least six months and some funds to develop this application so it’s truly reflective of state needs,” she said. “Instead we have a very short timeframe to submit the final application.” 
Ross outlined complexities of the application process and what would happen between the Nov. 5 deadline to turn it in and the federal government’s Dec. 31 deadline to award the dollars. She said the program is not a grant, but a cooperative agreement. 
“It is a negotiation between CMS and the state as to what will be within the transformation plan and what will come out,” she said. They “certainly appreciate CMS is balancing the demands of 50 applications. Our application does not stand alone on its merits. It always will stand in comparison to other applications.” 
 
The plan
In Kansas’ application, the coalition focused on the following priorities, outlined in a news release from Kelly: 

Expand prevention programs to reduce chronic disease rates, including increasing access to preventive screenings and behavioral health services.
Increase local access to primary care for rural Kansans
Build a sustainable rural health workforce to support greater access to primary care, dental and behavioral health providers and to ease health shortages. 
Increase to 100% the number of rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in accountable care relationships by 2031.
Use data and technology to help rural providers expand telehealth, remote monitoring and other technologies, as well as support data sharing and analysis of aggregated patient and outcome data.

Metrics are attached to each part of the plan and Ross said that if the state isn’t meeting its metrics at different points during the five-year process, CMS can withhold funds. That money would then be redistributed to states doing better, and Ross said it is important that Kansas tracks its progress well. 
The cost of collecting and tracking data is included in the administrative plan, she said. 
The proposal includes a breakdown of each of the main areas with specifics, such as embedding behavioral health providers into rural hospitals to provide services and expand access to PACE, a health care option for older Kansans who meet certain criteria. 
“At present, 34% of PACE-eligible Kansans (about 4,300 rural residents) do not have access to a PACE program,” the application said. “The state will partner with two successful PACE providers in the state to expand program availability in rural areas, one by expanding an existing program and another by establishing a new one.”
 
Political input
Kansas Republicans wanted to have input on the Rural Health Transformation Plan during a special session, but they were unable to get enough Republicans to sign a petition to hold the session. In a news release, House Speaker Dan Hawkins lamented the situation. 
“Whatever rural healthcare dollars that Santa Kelly gifts to her favored ‘children’ around the state won’t be able to be returned,” he said. “Those who refused to sign a petition played right into the Governor’s hands by giving her free rein without oversight on hundreds of millions of dollars. Sad.”
The main reason for the session was redistricting Kansas’ congressional districts, but several GOP lawmakers resisted the move.
The state’s federal delegation, led by U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, wrote a letter in support of the Kansas plan. Others signing on included U.S. representatives Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Sharice Davids. 
“Rural health care providers across Kansas recognize the urgent need for transformation,” the delegation wrote. “Yet, with many providers operating under persistent negative margins, they face significant barriers to making the critical investments necessary for regional collaboration, clinical integration, and modern technology solutions.”
The lawmakers said the Kansas plan will empower rural care providers and support initiatives to improve rural health.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P5162163-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

(Screenshot via campaign video)A Kentucky racehorse trainer has  joined the heated political race for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat, saying he’s not beholden to the Democratic Party or Republican President Donald Trump.
Dale Romans, a longtime Louisville trainer who has had numerous horses start the Kentucky Derby, announced his candidacy Wednesday morning. A press release from his campaign said he was joining the race “to stand up for working people across the state and fix the challenges facing our country like harmful tariffs and dangerous health care cuts – instead of waging exhausting partisan fights that get us nowhere and only divide the nation.” 
A campaign video from Romans focuses on his horse training experience and his relationship with his family. 
“I’ve been in Kentucky my entire life, and I think I know what Kentucky needs in Washington — an independent Democrat that can go to Washington, D.C., and vote for what’s right for the people of Kentucky,” Romans says in the video. 
Romans argues in the video that he would be someone not beholden to the Democratic Party and not a “puppet” for President Donald Trump, like a “Republican freshman senator would have to be.” 
Romans joins a crowded field of U.S. Senate candidates hoping to succeed longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who is not seeking reelection in 2026. Other Democrats who have announced campaigns include former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, former Secret Service agent Logan Forsythe, former CIA officer Joel Willett and Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson.

Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen prepare for a press conference following a vote on Capitol Hill on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images)I spend as little time as possible thinking about the game of politics, but the gambit was doomed from the beginning.
For the better part of a year, Democrats had been stumbling around in search of a hill to die on but couldn’t commit as a party. How do you pick just one thing to save from a democracy on fire? But by the end of September, they had firmly settled on the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits as a deserving place for their big stand. 
Millions would suffer, financially and bodily, without the health care subsidies, congressional Democrats argued, and so as costly as a government shutdown would be for the nation the Republicans had left them with no choice. This would be the GOP’s government shutdown, not theirs, they said. But the truth is that it was always the Democrats’ shutdown, which became clear this week when it took just eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus — including New Hampshire’s own Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — to bring it to an end. And what did they come away with for their record-setting efforts, other than relief from the pain of the shutdown itself? A vow from Senate Republicans that there would be a December vote on extending the tax credits.
In a statement Sunday far more defiant than contrite, Hassan said, “Congress has one month to engage in serious, bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts for health insurance.” Meanwhile, a clear-eyed Senate colleague, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said, “Even if it got 100 votes in the Senate, it’s not going to go anywhere in the House and the president certainly would not sign it.”
Only one of those statements is delusional, and yet it’s the one that carried the day. The Charlie Brown-ing of the Democratic Party continues.
The aftermath of Democrats’ “never mind” moment, meanwhile, has been equally predictable: Shaheen, Hassan, and the rest of the sacrificial octet have hit the airwaves to tell their side of things and offer political cover to any and all who desire it. With a wink and nod, friends, family, and colleagues have been invited to publicly feel all of their feelings of disappointment, but only in an “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here” kind of way.
If that sounds cynical, I really don’t mean to. That’s the game within the game, and always has been. The problem for Democrats is that they’re the only ones still playing.
The most important and fundamental question a society can ask itself is, “What do we owe to each other?” Traditionally, the Republican response has been “nothing” — especially when it comes to civil rights, economic equality, and a social safety net — while the Democratic role has been to clamor for some flavor of “everything.” The idea, at least theoretically, was that policy could never land on “nothing” or “everything” but rather in some amorphous middle that reflected both the ruling party’s power in the moment and the public’s appetite (or lack thereof) for progress. 
Republicans didn’t really mean we owe each other nothing any more than Democrats believed we owe each other everything, and those performances helped create the illusion of stability in the center.
But now when congressional Republicans answer “nothing,” that’s precisely what they mean. No harbor, no help, no empathy, no truth. By all appearances, Democrats seem to be waiting in vain for a return to rules they recognize — and a counteroffer that isn’t coming.
That’s why the gambit was doomed from the jump. Did Democrats really believe that Republicans in the era of Donald Trump, who above all want a government so small that it’s functionally non-existent, would fold during a soft launch of their ultimate fantasy?
On the other hand, if Democrats knew Republicans wouldn’t fold, 40-plus days of pain seems like an awfully steep price to pay just for increased public awareness of how bad things will get due to the expiring tax credits. Especially when the party of “nothing means nothing” has a thousand more manufactured crises waiting in the queue to help a reeling electorate forget the details of their broad misery.
Shaheen said she took her stand for the people and ended it for the same, applying the highest principle of public service to both her defiance and her capitulation. But in the end, nobody was served. We don’t ask our leaders to take us to the fringes of discomfort and suffering only to retreat. We ask them to lead us up to and through the pain, and only after they have clearly explained the purpose and likely cost of the full sacrifice.
Nobody thinks it’s easy to be a Democrat in Washington these days, and I wouldn’t dream of criticizing a politician for choosing empathy in this cruel age. But the only thing you accomplish with a half-hearted and ultimately empty stand is the dissipation of hope, in all its modern scarcity.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shaheenhassan-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

Wes Moore (D) is is setting up a campaign slate to back Democratic candidates — potentially primary challengers to incumbent lawmakers — who will support his agenda in Annapolis.  (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s Democratic governor is looking for a few Moore lawmakers.
Wes Moore, the first-term Democratic governor, announced Wednesday the creation of the “Leave No One Behind” slate. The campaign committee will be focused on backing the governor’s agenda.
“Today we take the first step toward creating a well-funded, well-organized effort to ensure we are electing leaders up and down the ballot dedicated to creating a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said in a statement. “Together we will create a team I am eager to help elect and work with to carry out the mission we came here to do: make this Maryland’s decade.”
Moore’s press release described the slate as an “initiative geared toward electing leaders up and down the ballot in Maryland’s 2026 Democratic primary and general election cycle.”
Such a campaign slate could be used to back challengers to incumbent Democrats.
It is unclear which races the campaign might focus on.
“After a resounding 2022 victory, the Moore-Miller Campaign knows 2026 is more important than ever and is preparing to invest and organize the best legislative slate possible to ensure victory in November and beyond. In the coming months, the Moore-Miller Campaign will announce endorsements and investments in key primary and general election races across Maryland,” according to the Moore campaign statement.

Moore has suffered a number of policy initiative setbacks, including a nuclear power bill that failed to advance in the Democrat-controlled legislature. He also struggled to get lawmakers to make changes to an increasingly expensive K-12 education reform plan known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.
The governor also saw lawmakers pare down what he considered an ambitious housing and jobs bill in the last legislative session, when his demand for a bill allowing the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores was rebuffed. The bill, sponsored by lawmakers, was not officially part of his legislative agenda, but he gave his support to the legislation, with didn’t get out of committee in the House or Senate.
Additionally, after Moore vetoed legislation this year to create a reparations study commission — a body Moore called redundant — a number of Democratic lawmakers were vocal about their desire to override his veto.
The announcement of the slate also comes as Moore is pushing for the possible redrawing of the state’s eight congressional districts. It faces a tough fight in the Senate, where a majority of Democrats, led by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), oppose the midcycle redistricting. Moore would need to convince 24 of the the 34 Democrats in the chamber to break with Ferguson for redistricting to have any hope.
Moore’s efforts are not unique. Other executives have used their position to target legislators.
In 2018, at a time when Gov. Larry Hogan was seeking re-election and an expansion of Republican seats in the Senate, he endorsed the primary opponent of Sen. Steve Waugh, a first-term Southern Maryland Republican who voted to override one of Hogan’s vetoes. Waugh’s vote was unnecessary given the super-majority Democrats enjoyed in the Senate.
Hogan was successful in replacing Waugh with current Sen. Jack Bailey.
Similarly, Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening was known to speak with legislators about issues in his office where they might coincidentally spy maps showing redistricted versions of their districts, some incarnations more advantageous to the legislator than others. But Glendening also had the advantage of being a lame duck in the final months of his term.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_4303-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

Tasha Gallup knew college could change her future—but her family didn’t think it was possible. With guidance and determination, Tasha found a path to college and specialized in sports medicine. Building the career of her dreams, she ultimately became a physician assistant.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Turning “We can’t afford that” into “I did it”: Tas[...]","Tasha Gallup and colleague Dr. Chris Vorys covering a Plymouth State University hockey game.
Tasha Gallup says that in high school, she was athletic, hardworking, and constantly thinking about what came next. She always knew that college would be the thing that would change her future for the better. “I had enough awareness to see that as hard as my parents worked, they were struggling,” she recalled. “I saw differences in families. I knew I was going to have to do something to earn my own successes. I realized that college was probably going to be the thing that helped me build the skills and knowledge to have a life where I could provide for and sustain myself.”
“If I set my mind to something, that was the hill I was going to die on.”
Sports were a big part of Tasha’s life at Spaulding High School. She played lacrosse for four years and was named a Vermont Senior All-Star when she graduated in 2000. That connection kindled her interest in a career that involved athletics. “I was always interested in sports medicine,” she said. “I thought athletic training was interesting, and I wanted to blend athletics with academics. I didn’t think I had the chops for med school, but I wanted to do something in that direction.” She was determined to figure out how to make it happen.
“We Can’t Afford That”
When she first told her mother she wanted to go to college, the response was painful. “She said, ‘We can’t afford that. It’s not going to work.’ I was dashed but I was heated. I wanted to do it, so I was going to do it.”
Tasha met with Clark Amadon, a counselor working in VSAC’s Talent Search program at the time. Clark began helping her figure out what might be possible. “I told Clark the truth. I said my parents couldn’t afford it. I was ready for him to say goodbye. Instead, he said, ‘Okay, if your parents can’t do this, there are other options. There are steps along the way.’ And I started to see it could be attainable.”
She remembers that first meeting at their kitchen table in Graniteville like it was yesterday. “Clark came to our house. He’s a tall man and there wasn’t a lot of space in our duplex…I remember him sitting at the table, and he had a laptop to help us with the documents and FAFSA. It was 1998 and laptops weren’t an everyday thing. My parents were nervous but gracious and they accepted the support and were willing to hear him out.” 
With Clark’s guidance, Tasha began to see all that might be possible for her.
Making it to Castleton
Tasha applied and was accepted to several Vermont schools. She eventually selected Castleton State College (now Vermont State University Castleton). 
When her financial aid package arrived, she was excited and apprehensive. She remembers, “it was so exciting to see that financial aid package. It felt like a true success when I had the realization that my goal of getting to college, being there, was going to happen.” 
She also recalls what it felt like to sign that first promissory note. “I took it so seriously when I signed that note. That meant a lot. My mom was nervous. She said, ‘This is for real. You have money on the line. If you’re going to do this, do this.’ I was committed. I had to get myself into a career field that could substantiate the obligation of what that loan meant.”
Learning beyond the classroom 
Tasha says that there’s no doubt, college was difficult. “I knew I wasn’t a star student. I was working hard but I was still so average. I remember my first paper in college—I got an F. I didn’t have the grammar skills I needed for success in college. I sat down with my professor because I knew I had to take responsibility for it. She showed me why the errors were errors. She said, ‘This is a comma splice.’ I said, ‘a what?’ She explained it. I knew that I had to work at it.”
Tasha began to set up structure in her days and week, and strong boundaries to make sure she had time to study, go to the library, participate in study groups, and meet with her professors when she needed help. Slowly, it started to pay off. 
In her junior year of school, her parents divorced. “Things were stressful and I needed to work more. I had four or five part-time jobs plus full-time school.” She ended up staying at Castleton for a fifth year in order to finish, taking a lighter course load those last few years to be able to balance work and school. 
“The dedication to the goal had never wavered,” she said. “I needed to take that extra time. I also knew that a bump didn’t mean the journey was over.”
Tasha proudly graduated with her Bachelor’s in Athletic Training in 2005. 
Building a career in sports medicine
After college, Tasha took on several jobs while saving up for the expense of taking her Athletic Trainer certification exam. “I worked at Dartmouth doing EKGs and exercise stress testing while studying and saving for my exam,” she said. She developed a mantra to help her stay grounded and focused: “The capability is mine to have. It’s the effort which I wish to put into it.”
After passing her exam, she spent the next seven years as an Athletic Trainer at a regional high school helping approximately 300 athletes across 26 varsity sports. Tasha notes that while it was a wonderful step in meeting her dream, she started to get the itch to go further. “I was seeing all these injuries and wanting to have more of a hand in the workup and diagnosis—I wanted to do more and be more involved in injury management.” Inspired to take the next step, Tasha decided to pursue a graduate degree that would enable her to become a Physician Assistant. 
A new chapter, despite an initial rejection
Tasha knew there were resources like VSAC that could help her. She paved the path to grad school and took the prerequisite classes she needed to apply to a Physician Assistant program while working full-time. “I burned the candle at both ends to get those credits covered,” she said.
But her first application to graduate school at Franklin Pierce University was denied. “I was so disappointed,” she remembers. She got on the waitlist the second time she applied, then got an unexpected phone call three weeks before classes started. “I got in, and I was so excited,” she remembers. But she had to move quickly to figure out financial aid, housing, and more. “I had put in the work to get this opportunity. I was not going to lose it.”
Tasha earned her Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies from Franklin Pierce University in 2017 and began working in orthopedic medicine. She got a job at a small hospital in New Hampshire as an orthopedic PA, splitting her time between surgery and seeing patients in the office. In addition to providing surgical and non-surgical orthopedic care to the patients of her community, she also stayed connected to her roots in sports medicine. Tasha worked with the Athletic Training Staff and was a part of the sports medicine team for the athletes of Plymouth State University, truly coming full circle in her dream of helping athletes manage injuries. 
Family, change, and perspective
Bristol, New Hampshire is home today for Tasha and her husband, Scott. Their nephews, ages 11 and 13, moved in with them last year. The change at home led to a change at work for Tasha. “I started practicing in family medicine, continuing with non-operative orthopedics. It has better family hours and I’m not on call,” she says.
She still misses parts of her earlier work. “I miss the rush of athletics and surgery where you are the calm and stabilization in the middle of a big storm. It was so rewarding. But when my nephews moved in, I was ready to move on.”
Looking back, she is clear that the help she got from VSAC mattered. “Clark helped me understand the steps I needed to take to secure financial aid. He came to the house, sat down with my parents, and helped us with the paperwork. Having that person who could explain it and believed I could do it—that changed everything.”

Darryl Bruce Fawcett, an Alaska Native man, was 28 years old when he went missing in 1999. His remains were found by divers in the Gastineau Channel in 2004. In July, with the help of a tool that analyzes DNA from bones, officials said they were able to compare a sample with a family member’s DNA and identify Fawcett.

“It is pretty rare, especially (with) that amount of time to have passed,” said Juneau Deputy Chief Krag Campbell, in August. “So I’m just happy that the family was able to get some closure on this.”
The forensic method is not new, but the Alaska Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory was able to adopt it with new federal grant funding, said crime lab chief David Kanaris. Forensic scientists are able to extract DNA from bones or teeth, which can be compared to DNA of a missing person or relative to make an identification. 
Previously, bone samples would be sent out-of-state for testing, usually to the University of North Texas, Kanaris said. The state may continue that practice as needed. “We saw real value in bringing on an ability to do most of the work here in Alaska, where we can,” he said. 
Cheryl Duda, a forensic scientist and DNA technical leader at the crime lab, said this forensic method is one of many that investigators use when unidentified remains are recovered. 
“For many years now, our laboratory has been able to do testing on a very wide variety of body tissues like blood, saliva, hair roots and skin cells, but all of those are very soft tissue types,” she said. “What is different about this technology that we’re bringing online is it’s a method to extract DNA from bones.”
Duda said that first, any unidentified remains reported to the state go through the Alaska State Medical Examiner’s Office, which determines first if they are human or animal. If deemed human, and a bone or tooth is recoverable, the agency will send a sample to the crime lab for analysis. The DNA is then entered into a national DNA database, the Combined DNA Index System, commonly called CODIS, where investigators can search for a match.
The database can compare the sample with samples of known missing persons, family members, or other samples that law enforcement has collected from crimes or that have been submitted by the public.   
“That’s the big first step for us, is generating this profile in the hopes of getting that match or that association in state, so that we can report those results,” Duda said. 
Jennifer Foster is a forensic scientist and supervisor at the crime lab, and said that the next step requires coordination across agencies. State employees work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that governs CODIS, other forensic labs, and local and state law enforcement departments conducting investigations. “So there’s a lot of communication,” she said. 
Officials at the crime lab say they’re working on a list of remains to be tested from the Alaska Medical Examiner’s Office, and cases are prioritized as they come into the lab. Once DNA samples are entered into the national database, the search continues. 
“So that profile routinely searches every night,” Duda said. “It does missing persons searches monthly. Relatives of missing person searches monthly. So as long as it doesn’t need to be removed for whatever reason, it stays in there and will search.”
Austin McDaniel, director of communications for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, said the state has analyzed three more cases since August, but no identifications have been made.
McDaniel said each case of unidentified remains is prioritized as it comes in through the Medical Examiner’s office, and investigators pursue and coordinate leads for identification. He said the new tool won’t necessarily unlock the state’s cold cases.
“If pulling DNA from bone fragments would have been helpful before, you know, either the crime lab or the medical examiner could have sent that out to other labs to have it completed. So I wouldn’t say there’s, like, this huge backlog of cases that just haven’t ever been worked,” he said.
There are currently 60 unidentified persons cases open in Alaska, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons Database, which goes back to 1968. The most recent unidentified remains on that list are bones found in a creek on Aug. 24 in Anchorage.
McDaniel said new DNA samples also get shared with the national database by the public through commercial at-home genetic testing, which can be shared with law enforcement. “That’s usually a box people can check, something like that might happen. Or maybe we go through and have family members reach out to us and offer familial DNA samples that can be compared against,” he said.
McDaniel said local law enforcement investigators can request the DNA analysis as they pursue leads. “An investigator from any number of agencies, not just the Troopers, as they’re trying to go through and maybe work on some of these cases they might go through to reach out to a family member proactively that they suspect might be related to the decedent, and see they can collect a voluntary sample from from them,” he said. 
Kanaris, as head of the crime lab, acknowledged these are sensitive cases, especially as Alaska grapples with a crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people. Alaska Native residents are disproportionately victims of violent crime. At least 27% of the 1,268 known cases on the state’s Missing Persons Clearinghouse database, managed by the Alaska Department of Public Safety, involve Alaska Native people. 
“We have worked with the tribal liaisons, understanding that a lot of these bones may come from Alaska Native remains,” Kanaris said. “And so we want to handle these samples as sensitively as we can and be as culturally aware as we can.”
He said another benefit of having this DNA analysis tool in the state’s crime lab, is handling cases more promptly. 
“They’re going to involve less transit time. The bones are going to stay in state, and they will, hopefully, be able to be returned to the families for closure as soon as possible. That would be one of the benefits of this,” he said. 
“I’d like to see us be able to work as many of the samples, not just with bones, but across the board, with forensic science samples in Alaska, at the Alaska crime lab,” he said. “So I think this is a big step forward for us.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC07250-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 09:56:36.922742

After a rural California hospital shut down its maternity ward in 2022, pregnant women in Plumas County had to travel at least 70 miles to give birth. It was among dozens of California communities that lost labor and delivery services in the past decade. 
That may change by next year, though, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two new laws that seek to mitigate California’s maternity care deserts, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
Because of rising costs, staffing issues and declining birth rates, Plumas District Hospital in Quincy closed its maternity ward three years ago. Since then, patients giving birth must travel for hours either north to Susanville; south to Truckee through winding mountain roads; or even farther east to Nevada, where the hospitals are larger.
But in October Newsom signed a bill to create a 10-year pilot program allowing hospitals, including Plumas, to establish standby maternity units that operate only when needed instead of 24/7. He also signed another measure lifting some licensing requirements for birth centers to receive state approval. Typically run by midwives, birth centers accept low-risk pregnancies. At least 20 birth centers have closed in California over the last three years. 
Because of the new legislation, the hospital aims to open a standby maternity ward by next year. It also plans to open a birth center after facility leaders saw a growing demand for it: A community midwife delivered more babies at people’s homes in 2022 than the hospital did in its maternity ward, according to the hospital’s director of business development.
Lori Link, a certified nurse midwife with the hospital, said many of her current patients ask about when the birth center will open — evidence to her that the hospital’s maternity care plans are warranted because the community wants it. 

Link: “I think this is a testimony to the power of listening to women.”

Let’s dive into some California environmental news:

Colorado River talks: California and six other Western states along the Colorado River faced a federal deadline Tuesday in their negotiations over how to portion water from the overtapped river. Despite two years of talks, the states remain deadlocked over how much they must scale back their water usage. Current river management guidelines expire in 2026, and federal officials have threatened to step in if states fail to reach an agreement. The federal administration under President Donald Trump has yet to specify what it might do if it needs to intervene. Read more from CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.


CA at climate conference: Gov. Newsom on Monday slammed the Trump administration’s absence at the United Nations’ climate conference in Brazil as “rather jaw dropping.” The governor, along with other state officials and legislators, led a delegation at the conference on behalf of California, symbolically standing in for the U.S. government. California officials say attending the conference is valuable because it helps build international relationships, informs policy and enables the state to join agreements with other regional governments. But critics argue California’s presence is performative and fails to represent local interests. Read more from CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde and Alejandro Lazo.




On the scene at UC Berkeley clash

The U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday that it is investigating UC Berkeley after protestors clashed outside a campus event held by Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that seeks to promote conservative values on college campuses. UC Berkeley was the organization’s final stop of its tour, as well as its first event at a California college campus since its co-founder, Charlie Kirk, was fatally shot in September.
Ella Carter-Klauschie and Chrissa Olson of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network were on the ground, reporting that while most of the speeches during the event focused on Kirk and criticizing the campus protests, demonstrators outside chanted “Fascists out of Berkeley,” “Trump must go now,” and “F—k Charlie Kirk.” Students collided with police, who wore riot gear and held batons and projectile weapons, leading to at least four arrests.

Speaking of the UC: The UC’s 26-member Board of Regents sets policies for the UC system and all its campuses, including on tuition increases. But currently, only one of the two student positions on the board has voting power.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom may be playing a “climate warrior” at the U.N. climate talks, but in recent months he has tiptoed away from the decarbonization programs he had previously championed.
Legislators claim to speak for victims without ever asking them what they actually think — but a new University of San Francisco survey, which reflects the real concerns of victims, brings some hope for change, writes Jess Nichol, one of the sisters of the late Polly Klaas and an advocate with Californians for Safety and Justice.

A study will collect survivors' thoughts.","Guest Commentary written by

Jess Nichol 
Jess Nichol is one of the sisters of the late Polly Klaas and an advocate with Californians for Safety and Justice


When I was 12 years old, my sister, Polly Klaas, was kidnapped from our bedroom and murdered. In the aftermath, I watched lawmakers use grieving families — ours included — to sell the public on legislative policies that had already been written. 
Polly’s name became synonymous with fear. And California’s Three Strikes law swept through the legislature.
Here’s what legislators weren’t doing: asking what would help us heal, what would make us feel safer, or what kind of system we actually wanted. 
They were looking for pain they could weaponize. And it worked. Politicians simply assumed they knew what victims wanted, and they used our grief to push an agenda that had little to do with actual safety or healing.
I’ve spent years watching how survivor voices get co-opted — how our pain becomes a tool for policies that don’t serve us. Polly’s story became shorthand for “tough on crime,” and was used to justify mass incarceration, even though research shows victims overwhelmingly prefer rehabilitation and community investment over longer prison sentences. 
The gap between what we’re told victims want and what we actually need has felt impossible to close. That’s why I’m so moved by what’s happening right now in California.
For the first time, researchers at the University of San Francisco are surveying crime victims, survivors and their family members who have participated in parole hearings for someone who harmed them or their loved one. 
The survey asks simple but radical questions: What was your experience actually like? What did you need that you didn’t get? What would have helped?
This might not sound revolutionary, but it is. For generations, legislators have claimed to speak for victims while passing laws without ever asking us what we actually think. 
What would have made a difference
This survey flips that script. It was co-designed with victims and survivors over several months, ensuring that the questions reflect our real concerns — not what policymakers assume we care about. 
It asks about what support we received (or didn’t), how we were treated by the system, what resources would have made a difference and what reforms we believe would help others walking this difficult path.
It matters enormously that victims and survivors are leading this process, not as symbolic voices brought in after decisions are made, but as co-creators. 
The survey is open through November 30th. The findings will be shared with policymakers, advocates and community leaders to ensure victim and survivor voices guide future reforms. 
I know firsthand how rare this is. When Polly died in 1993, grief counselors and victim advocates would have helped our family immensely — but those services barely existed. 
Instead, we got media scrutiny and political theater. Her story was used to justify laws that primarily incarcerated people of color for low-level crimes — the very opposite of the justice and safety those laws promised. 
If someone had asked us what we needed then, we would have said, time to grieve, mental health support and a system that recognized us as victims in need of care, not props for a political agenda.
Our experience matters — not as a talking point — but as truth that can shape what comes next.
I’ve learned through my own healing journey that real change happens through connection, understanding, and genuine accountability — not through punishment, shame, or control. 
The same is true for policy. When we create laws based on what victims and survivors experience and need, rather than on fear or political calculation, we build systems that serve healing and safety instead of systems that perpetuate harm.
For so long, I’ve carried the weight of knowing that my sister’s story was used to build systems that don’t work — that harm communities, that don’t make us safer and that don’t reflect what victims actually need. 
This survey represents something different: a chance to build policy grounded in truth rather than fear, in healing rather than retribution, in the voices of those who’ve lived through violence rather than those who exploit it.
That feels like hope. And right now, we could all use a little more of that.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725-Polly-Klaas-NC-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

Steven Horsford at the No Kings rally in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)The Senate resolution that reopens the federal government without extending health care subsidies, but allows some Republicans to sue the government over the Jan. 6 investigation, is “betrayal of a bill,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford.  
Horsford, who spoke virtually Monday night to the NAACP Las Vegas chapter, said he wouldn’t support the resolution to reopen the government “as proposed and written” because it didn’t restore subsidies to the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums or reverse Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration bill passed this summer.
The House, which hasn’t been in session since mid-September, is expected to reconvene Wednesday. 
The measure to end the longest government shutdown in American history doesn’t address the health care policy concerns raised by Democrats, Horsford said.
But it does add language that allows eight Republican senators who have their phone records seized during an investigation by Jack Smith, the former special counsel who was looking into the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to sue the government for up to $500,000. 
Horsford expected the Republican-led House “to rush the process” to get the bill over the finish line before more people learn of the additional provisions. 
“More details about what’s in the bill and what’s not in the bill are going to become more evident,” he said. “People are already upset and pissed with what the Senate has done. When you really drill down on what’s in there and what’s not, that’s going to make more people say, ‘what are we doing?’”
Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto were among the eight Democratic Senators who broke with the majority of their caucus Monday to vote for a continuing resolution to reopen the government through Jan. 30. 
Their votes have been criticized by a broad coalition of fellow Democratic lawmakers, progressive organizers, and even the centrist group Third Way. 
Cortez Masto, along with U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, had voted consistently with Senate Republicans on a continuing resolution from the beginning. 
Rosen had held out on voting on the resolution without a commitment from Republicans to extend health care subsidies. Less than two weeks into the shutdown, Rosen said to take Republicans at their word now when they say “‘trust me,’ when they violated that trust every single time, it’s a little naive on our part.”
She relented on Monday.
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike.
Without changes, Horsford said an estimated 28,000 people in Nevada lose their health insurance with “another 100,000 seeing their rates double to the point they can’t really afford it anymore.” 
“It’s not even a permanent funding bill and does nothing to address the Republican-caused health care crisis,” Horsford said of the resolution coming to the House. 
The resolution would only fund parts of the government through the end of January. 
Because of several additions to the bill, the measure has to go through a full House process. 
“We better be offered opportunities to bring amendments both in the rules committee and on the floor and to debate before the American people why we were able to move this bill but not something to address the health care crisis,” Horsford said.
The bill is likely to pass —  President Donald Trump, who wields enormous power over the House Republican majority, has praised the bill, saying “the deal is very good.” 
“I didn’t go to Congress to cut health care,” Horsford said. “Republicans control the House, the Senate, and White House. That means if they want to pass a bipartisan bill that cuts health care, that takes away food from needy families … they can do it without me.”
Horsford was joined at the NAACP event by state Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal, who said she was “mad as hell” about the agreement the faction of Senate Democrats reached with Republicans. 
Neal said federal workers she has heard from are puzzled about why the Democrats caved to pressure. 
“If they were going to give in, then they could have done that on day four,” Neal said, referencing frustration of federal workers, adding they believe “There was no reason for us to go 40 days without getting paid if you weren’t going to hold the line.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/horsfordNK-1024x663.jpg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

(Hoover Dam photo: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation)Nevada and six other Colorado River states failed to reach a broad agreement Tuesday on how to share the river’s dwindling water supply, missing a federally-imposed deadline after days of intense closed-door negotiations.
Despite missing the deadline, the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation indicated states would be given additional time to continue negotiations after making “collective progress.”
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” said a joint statement from the seven states, the Interior Department and the Bureau of Reclamation.
The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – initially gave states until Nov. 11 to submit a preliminary agreement for a plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines set to expire at the end of 2026. 
The initial timeline also called for states to share a final consensus-based plan by mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer of 2026 with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum previously indicated that the federal government would intervene in the Colorado River water negotiations if the seven basin states couldn’t reach their own agreement.
The Department of the Interior did not respond to questions about a new deadline after states missed Tuesday’s or whether the agency would intervene.
Representatives from the Lower Basin states — Nevada, Arizona, and California — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — attempted to hammer out an agreement over a two-day meeting in Phoenix but could not reach a deal to manage the drought-stricken river.
In a joint statement the seven states and federal water managers said they “recognize the serious and ongoing challenges facing the Colorado River.”
Prolonged drought driven by climate change has put immense pressure on the overtapped Colorado River which sustains agriculture in the West and provides water for 40 million people across seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes and parts of northern Mexico. 
“Through continued cooperation and coordinated action, there is a shared commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of the Colorado River system,” the joint statement said.
‘Getting down to the wire,’ conservation groups try to pump up Colorado River negotiations

State negotiators for both the Upper and Lower Basin have said they would prefer a seven-state agreement than the alternative river management options proposed by the federal government last year.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he believes there is still a path to a seven-state consensus, despite states failure to meet the federal deadline Tuesday.
“While the Basin States did not finalize an agreement today on post-2026 Colorado River operations, our commitment to a state-led path remains,”  Cox said Tuesday afternoon on the social media site X.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
The Lower Basin – Nevada, Arizona, and California – want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under the current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts during shortages.
That disagreement prompted lawmakers in Arizona on Tuesday to call for stronger federal intervention in shaping post-2026 Colorado River operating guidelines. 
In a letter to Interior Secretary Burgum on Tuesday, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and legislative leaders asked the federal government to include water supply reductions for Upper Basin states in any new guidelines they consider.
“This extreme negotiating posture – four of the seven Basin States refusing to participate in any sharing of water shortages – has led to a fundamental impasse that is preventing the successful development of a 7-State consensus plan for management of the Colorado River,” wrote Hobbs in the letter. 
Lower Basin states have offered to conserve 1.5 million acre-feet of Colorado River water each year under post-2026 operating guidelines on the condition that Upper Basin states share cuts if further reductions are needed during dry years. Arizona would bear the brunt of those reductions. 
“The existing Colorado River operating guidelines are near expiration, and a meager runoff season has left the reservoirs depleted once again and one bad winter away from reaching critical lows,” reads the Arizona letter.
‘Rip off the Band Aid’
The Bureau of Reclamation will still need to go through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process so they can assess the environmental impact of the plan before issuing a final decision on new guidelines for the river’s management. 
The agency plans to release draft post-2026 operating guidelines in December detailing options for how to manage the Colorado River, followed by an open public comment period. 
After two years of state negotiations, some conservation groups also urged the Bureau of Reclamation to move on to the public NEPA process without a state consensus plan.
“Rip off the Band Aid, and let the public get to work. The states don’t deserve the kid-glove treatment any longer,” said Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
John Weisheit, the conservation director of Living Rivers, echoed calls for the federal government to step up.
“It is clear that negotiators cannot hash out a meaningful management regime to deal with the dwindling reservoir levels that we will likely see in the coming years,” Weisheit said. “The federal government’s deference to the states has got to stop.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/53087352100_8c77cde5dc_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

(Courtesy of Lizzy Hayes)For 35 years, Charles and Linda Gill have run a family farm in Bowdoinham. While initially focused on cut flowers and herbs, they shifted to growing hemp after regulated production was legalized. The hemp-derived products they produce, such as topicals for muscle pain and gummies to assist with sleep, are each accompanied with a handwritten note from Linda when sold at farmers markets, wholesale or shipped across the country. 
“We are not in the business of these intoxicating hemp products on the market, which are the ones that are screwing it up for everybody,” Charles Gill said. “They’re abusing the system.” 
Charles Gill is referring to companies exploiting a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp production, which he thinks should be closed, as do many other hemp farmers in Maine. But they say the way the federal government has proposed to do so would not just prevent exploitation — it would decimate the industry. 
“All our current products would be banned,” Charles Gill said. “It would pretty much put us out of business.”
A provision tucked into the deal to reopen the federal government would drastically lower the allowable threshold for legal THC products. After passing the U.S. Senate on Monday, it now awaits the approval of the U.S. House of Representatives. White House officials have said President Donald Trump supports the language. 
Hemp provision in federal shutdown legislation would nullify Maine law

While hemp and marijuana both come from cannabis, hemp contains less THC, which is the compound that makes people high. Since the 2018 bill, it has been legal to sell hemp-derived THC products as long as they contain less than 0.3% THC by dry weight. This made it possible to take legal amounts of THC from hemp and turn it into intoxicating substances — the loophole that there is growing pressure to address. 
The proposal in the pending appropriations bill would prohibit hemp products from having more than .4 milligrams of total THC per container and ban these products for “personal or household use.”  
According to a summary of the bill put together by the staff of Senate Appropriations Chair U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the language would prevent “the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.”
The new limits would also override Maine law, which limits THC to three milligrams per serving. 
There is widespread understanding in Maine, and across the country, that regulations are needed for intoxicating hemp products, which are frequently designed to mimic the design of popular snacks, candies and sodas, making them attractive to children. 
In contrast to cannabis products, hemp-derived THC products still remain largely unregulated, though earlier this year Maine passed a law that includes packaging requirements for intoxicating products that can now only be sold to people over the age of 21. 
Lizzy Hayes, an organic hemp farmer in Cornville who worked on that legislation, said, “that’s more common sense” than how the federal government could alternatively regulate these products.
Hayes, whose farm Panorama Seeds doesn’t produce hemp for intoxicating products, said under the proposed limits “that would mean that a whole package of CBD oil, which you wouldn’t be able to produce under these rules anyway, would never be an effective therapeutic dose.” 
Pointing to established and preliminary findings about CBD’s beneficial effects, Hayes said the passage of the federal changes would hurt Mainers who have come to rely on the products. 
Charles Gill similarly drew a distinction between intoxicating products and the type of products he sells. 
“If you ate a whole jar of vanilla extract, you’d get drunk too, but that’s not the intent,” he said. “My worry is that if they say that [essentially] no THC can be in CBD products, it becomes a very different product.” 
Nyeela Hueholt of Rooted Heart Remedies, a registered hemp farm in Buxton, said Congress should focus on how some companies are exploiting the current limits rather than the limits themselves. 
“The chemical processing to change a non-psychoactive constituent into a psychoactive constituent — that being illegal would be understandable,” Huebolt said. “But to put us all under this umbrella… to go back just because some people are abusing it, doesn’t make any sense.” 
As the federal government considers the provision, the state is also grappling with regulations on hemp, medical cannabis and recreational cannabis, the latter of which has greater restrictions and high taxes. 
In the state budget passed this year, the cannabis sales tax was increased — from 10% to 14% — a change that will take effect on January 1. 
When the Maine Legislature returns shortly after, lawmakers will again consider a proposal from last session that would add testing and tracking requirements for medical cannabis, which isn’t required to be tested for contaminants and potency like adult-use cannabis.

Technicians from different Utah, Arizona and federal offices inspected over 288,500 boats and performed 6,509 decontaminations of quagga mussels and other aquatic invasive species like Eurasian watermilfoil since the start of 2025, according to a release from the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.

That’s an increase from the 6,383 boats decontaminated in 2024. But the state is overall happy with boaters’ compliance to keep invasive species from spreading in the state, said Lt. Bruce Johnson, from the Utah Department of Natural Resources Law Enforcement Aquatic Invasive Species Statewide Operations.
“We really appreciate everyone’s efforts,” Johnson said. “And while the boating season is winding down for the year, make sure to plan ahead for next year and be sure to take the mandatory education course, pay the required fees, and display the necessary decals on your watercraft, so you can be ready for another great boating season next year.” 
Currently, the only waterbody infested with quagga mussels in the state is Lake Powell, the division said in the release, however, contamination was also found in other waterbodies in Utah coming from infested reservoirs outside the state.
Idaho state officials say they haven’t found viable quagga mussels since latest treatment

The state highlighted that quagga mussels can have different negative impacts. They can plug water lines. If they get into water delivery systems, it can cost millions of dollars a year to remove and result in higher utility bills. They also remove plankton from the water, hurting fish species, damage boats’ engines and stink when they die in large numbers.
That’s why all boaters in the state are required to take a mussel awareness online course each year, and clean, drain and dry their boats before launching in other waters. Those with motorized watercrafts have to pay an enrollment fee, and get a decontamination certification if their last launch was outside the state or at a mussel-infested waterbody.
“During the winter season, there aren’t many available watercraft inspection staff at the stations across the state,” Johnson said. “So we ask boaters going to Lake Powell — or to neighboring states’ mussel-infested waterbodies — to please either have their watercraft decontaminated at that location before leaving, or to call us ahead of time if they are going to need a decontamination before their next launch.”

SB 23, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, would apply a special primary election to legislative and congressional districts if they are changed by the Legislature or a judge. 
Under the bill, any district affected by U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco’s order for new district lines would hold a special primary election before the end of August. There would be no special general election for the affected districts. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The primary election for the 2026 midterms is on May 19. Districts affected by the bill would only have their primaries in August. A message seeking comment was left with Gudger’s office on Tuesday. The Legislature begins its 2026 regular session on Jan. 13. 
Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled in August that Alabama’s Senate maps violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. 
Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively.
After multiple check-ins with Manasco and lawyers with both sides, Gov. Kay Ivey said in September that she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a similar case in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana, in which the justices are considering whether majority-minority districts are constitutional. A ruling is expected by next summer.
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the special master, recommended two maps to remedy the VRA violation.
The special master recommended three maps, ranking two as what he thought was best. Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen objected to all three recommendations, with one being “the least bad of several bad options.”
“Each of the proposed plans was drawn with a racial target,” Allen wrote in an Oct. 31 court filing. 
Allen and other state Republican leaders have consistently said that the redistricting process is racial gerrymandering on principle. In August, GOP Chairman John Wahl said the litigation is “racist by nature.” 
The map that Allen said was the “least bad” is the same map the special master, Richard Allen, said was the weakest remedy to Manasco’s ruling. Manasco ordered a second district in Montgomery that had a 50% Black voting age population, or something close to it. 
“The special master puts forward Remedial Plan 3 because, while it weakly remedies the Section Two violation, the comparison of Remedial Plan 3 to Remedial Plans 1 and 2 demonstrates the impact of modifying a third district (District 30) on the effectiveness of the remedy,” the special master wrote in his October recommendation.
The plaintiffs in the case requested that Remedial Plan 2 be adopted, according to an Oct. 31 filing. The plaintiffs said that Remedial Plan 2 is unimpeachable of racial gerrymandering and is the best remedy to Manasco’s ruling. 
Deuel Ross, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said Tuesday he had not reviewed Gudger’s legislation as of Tuesday afternoon.
“Plaintiffs object to Plan 3 both because only White candidates stand any chance of winning in Senate District 26 and because Black-preferred candidates (regardless of race) win less than 50% of the time,” the plaintiffs wrote in the filing. “Under Plan 3, Black candidates in SD26 won only three (23%) of the 13 analyzed elections and none of these wins occurred after 2018. Report at 19. Even including those wins, Black candidates lose by an average margin of over 7%.”
Should the U.S. Supreme Court rule for Louisiana in the Callais case, Alabama’s 2nd and 7th congressional districts — represented by Democratic U.S. reps. Shomari Figures of Mobile and Terri Sewell of Birmingham — could be placed in jeopardy. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling of a lower court panel, which included Manasco, that Alabama’s congressional maps denied Black voters a proper say in their governance, and ordered new ones drawn.

The special master’s plans

Remedial Plan 1 reallocates South Montgomery in Senate District 26 to Senate District 25, leaving a tail of the south-western portion of Montgomery County in District 26. The northern part of the district is extended into Elmore County, which is currently in Senate District 30 represented by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville.
Remedial Plan 1 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 49.7% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 20% in Senate District 30. 
The second map, Remedial Plan 2, completely reallocates the southern portion of District 26 to District 25. It also extends northward into District 30, but not as far. 
Remedial Plan 2 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 53.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 48.3% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 19.1% in Senate District 30.
Remedial Plan 3 extends Senate District 25 into southern Montgomery and extends Senate District 26 into Elmore County, which is currently in District 25. 
Remedial Plan 3 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.1% in Senate District 25 and 66.1% to 43.9% in Senate District 26.

Photo provided by Scott Greer.If you explore the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor, go upstairs, and find the Opera Room, you might see a quilt. It is a work by Toby Millman, a University of Michigan faculty member and alum, and was commissioned by the University of Michigan Arts Initiative. It is part of a larger exhibit called Visual History of the Unions.
The exhibit was supposed to open on October 16, with the various pieces displayed in high traffic areas on the ground floor. Instead, the quilt and most of the other artworks in the exhibition are in an obscure room that opened on Nov 6 for six weeks only.
Why?
Well, the title of the appliqué quilt is a tipoff: “Tahrir Coalition- March 28, 2024.” It shows a group of students gathered in the Union, with Palestinian flags, protesting the genocide being conducted in Gaza with the support of the US. It is unclear who made the decision to delay, relocate, and shorten the timeframe for the exhibition. It could have been a staff member in charge of the University of Michigan Unions, or some higher level administrator. But relocated it was.
The story of that quilt is telling. Regardless of what you think about Israel or international law or student activists, or appliqué quilt art, it is a story of obedience in advance by administrators. Of looking around for people who might stifle free speech at the U of M, and giving them what they want before they ask for it. And therefore of the moral collapse, in historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat’s words, that enables the loss of a democracy.
That’s an awfully heavy message to fold into a quilt, no?
Well, the quilt is only an issue because a university administrator decided to make it an issue. And, as likely as not, that decision was taken out of fear of outside forces.
The evidence is in a genuinely shocking new report. The American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association just released their research on the weaponization of civil rights law to stifle speech and debate on campus.
It’s amazing. It documents a surge of civil rights investigations since 2023, overwhelmingly focused on speech rather than traditional civil rights complaints such as sexual or racial discrimination.

Discriminating-Against-Dissent_0 
These actions are in response to reports that make it clear that criticism of Israeli policy, rather than anti-semitism, is the focus: “All but one of the 102 antisemitism complaint letters we have analyzed focus on speech critical of Israel; of these, 79% contain allegations of antisemitism that simply describe criticisms of Israel or Zionism with no reference to Jews or Judaism; at least 50% of complaints consist solely of such criticism.”
It is legitimate to debate the relationship of Judaism and Zionism, but this is a bare-knuckle fight, not a debate about identity and ideology.
And, finally, efforts to chill campus discussion of the Middle East are part of a broader political agenda. The report finds that 78% of complaints were from right-wing advocacy organizations, including some with no campus presence, and at least 24% of investigations were opened based on complaints by actors with no connection to the school. In fact, at least 15 investigations were opened based on “complaints from a single conservative activist with no relation to any of the schools investigated!”
The fear on American college campuses is being driven from the outside. Outside agitators are at work all right, but they are overwhelmingly on the side of repression and coordination with the Trump administration.
Professor Jean Hong of the University of Michigan, at the annual Davis, Market and Nickerson lecture in honor of the fight for free speech at Michigan, spoke to the way fear works in a university. Discussing her experience as a professor in Hong Kong during the Chinese Communist crackdown on free speech there, a time when once free speakers rapidly learned the art of self-censorship, she noted that the university didn’t impose it. Outside forces in government and their allies in society did the work.
But unlike the people of Hong Kong, we do not face the full power of the People’s Republic of China. A conservative activist who files fifteen complaints is a far cry from the youth wing of the Chinese Communist Party. The threat to American democracy is a increasingly unpopular president with a thin electoral victory who has been repeatedly  repudiated by both the overwhelming majority of federal courts – and the voters who had elections this month.
Put another way, there are far more people who like American democracy than people who are willing to sacrifice it. If every little action taken by anti-democratic forces and those they cow is challenged, then over time they will be overwhelmed.
Americans often imagine that you lose your democracy when there are tanks in the streets and colonels in mirrored sunglasses taking over the TV studio. But democracies are more likely to die in subtler and superficially legal ways these days, as anti-democratic political forces take advantage of others’ weakness, careerism, and fear, and chip away at our rights.
Democracy, and a university, can die not in a coup, but one quilt at a time.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Families of Black homicide victims in the United States are more likely than any other group to seek financial assistance through state victim compensation programs — and they are the most likely to be denied, according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Race and Justice.
Researchers analyzed nearly 60,000 homicide-related compensation claims filed in 18 states between 2015 and 2023. They found that nearly one-third of all the denials were based on “contributory misconduct,” a discretionary policy in which officials, often relying on police reports and assessments, can deny compensation if they judge that the victim’s behavior or alleged criminal involvement contributed to their death.
Families of Black victims submitted about 46% of all claims for compensation, but made up 57% of denials attributed to contributory misconduct. The researchers note that this may reflect subjective judgments and racial biases, which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic or Latino families.
Even after controlling for gender, state and year of application, the researchers found that families of Black and American Indian victims had lower compensation approval rates — about 82% — compared with roughly 87% for white victims and nearly 91% for Asian victims. Families of male victims and those of younger victims aged 18 to 24 were also less likely to receive compensation.
Crime victims may get fewer services as federal aid drops. States weigh how to help.

Victims of crime often face a maze of legal and administrative barriers, making it hard to secure compensation or other support.
State-based crime victim compensation programs are often at least partially funded by the federal 1984 Victims of Crime Act or VOCA, which uses federal criminal fines and forfeitures — not taxpayer dollars — to support victims of violent crime. These funds are allocated to states by Congress.
These programs provide financial relief to individuals and families affected by violent crimes, including homicide. Compensation can cover expenses such as counseling, funeral costs, emergency assistance and lost wages. But the amount of funding available to states has plummeted by billions of dollars in recent years. In response, some states have stepped in to fund crime victim programs with state dollars. 
In August, 21 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to tie victims’ compensation to its immigration agenda. The administration sought to withhold funds from states that refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice quietly released its state-by-state VOCA fund allocations for fiscal year 2025. Collectively, the states and Washington, D.C. received $1.25 billion in support.
The researchers warn that barriers to accessing support may worsen financial and emotional hardships for grieving families and reinforce broader inequalities. They call for changes such as limiting denials based on contributory misconduct, expanding administrative support for applicants and standardizing data collection across states to better monitor disparities.

New California laws are bringing maternity care closer to home,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/11/plumas-maternity-birth-center/,"Three years after closing its maternity ward, a new state law will help a rural Northern California hospital bring birth services back to the community.","In summary
Three years after closing its maternity ward, a new state law will help a rural Northern California hospital bring birth services back to the community.


At 3:30 on a July morning, Emily Meyers’ water broke. Her son was coming five weeks early. Meyers and her husband jumped in the car and raced from their home in Greenville, population 387, to Reno, Nev. where they had planned to deliver. It was a two-hour drive along mostly narrow, two-lane highways shared with logging trucks. 
They didn’t make it in time. Their son, Grant, was born in the car 13 minutes from the hospital to two stunned parents.
Along the way they had passed two other hospitals — Plumas District Hospital in Quincy and Eastern Plumas Health Care in Portola — neither of which have maternity wards. Meyers’ husband had asked if she wanted to stop at either one, but she told him to keep driving. 
“At that point I didn’t know how intense things were going to be,” Meyers said. “I didn’t feel like I could stop in the little towns if something was wrong.”
Meyers’ frantic experience exemplifies the challenges that have become commonplace for pregnant patients in rural California: Dozens of hospitals have stopped delivering babies across the state, leaving many families with no option other than to drive for hours and hope for the best.
But in the remote Sierra Nevada community where Meyers lives, hospital executives have a plan to change things. 
Plumas District Hospital, one of the hospitals Meyers sped past during labor, closed its maternity ward in 2022 after costs grew and birth rates declined. This year, it helped pass two state laws that give rural hospitals the ability to reimagine birth services. 
One of the laws, authored by Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, creates a 10-year pilot program allowing hospitals such as Plumas District Hospital to create “standby” maternity units that operate only when needed, rather than offering standard 24/7 service. 
The unit must have the ability to do surgical deliveries, blood transfusions, resuscitation and life-support measures. The California Department of Public Health will monitor and evaluate safety outcomes with the new model.
A related law relaxes some of the licensing requirements for birth centers, which are typically run by midwives and accept low-risk pregnancies. 
“Expecting moms and their families in rural California deserve better,” said McGuire, a Democrat from Santa Rosa whose district stretches north to the Oregon border, in a statement to CalMatters.
Dr. Robert Moore, chief medical officer for Partnership HealthPlan, a health insurer that covers the state’s northernmost counties, said it’s not realistic for some rural hospitals to offer maternity care 24 hours a day. The numerous closures prove that. Emergency maternity services are better than none at all, he added.
“It’s not acceptable for someone to travel two hours to the nearest hospital. The outcomes are not worth it,” Moore said. “We owe it to the rural areas of the state to fix it.”
A new birth center for Plumas County 
Next year, as a result of the legislation, Plumas District Hospital plans to open a birth center and standby maternity ward. Women who qualify and do not want an epidural will be able to give birth locally. The hospital’s on-call obstetrics team will be available to take transfers from the birth center should any complications arise that require a doctor.
Darren Beatty, chief operating and government affairs officer for the hospital, said maternity care is part of what makes a rural community vibrant, and it’s why facility leadership pushed hard to change state law over the past few years.
“We’re experiencing multiple threats in and outside of health care to maintain(ing) a rural lifestyle,” Beatty said. “We need to do our part so that Quincy can be an outlier and not continue to shrink and go away like many rural communities have.”
Nearly 60 hospitals have stopped labor and delivery services since 2012 in rural and urban areas alike, according to a CalMatters database. But in rural areas, when a hospital stops delivering babies, it is often the last option left to a community. The closest hospitals to Plumas with maternity wards are a 70-mile drive north to Susanville or south to Truckee through winding mountain roads. Many families, like the Meyers family, choose to go east to Nevada where the hospitals are farther but larger.
The Plumas District Hospital chose to open a birth center because families in the county want something different: Home births have trended upward since 2020. 
A community midwife delivered more babies at people’s homes in 2022 than the hospital did in its labor and delivery ward, said Tiffany Leonhardt, director of business development.
“That was just really a huge eye opener to us,” Leonhardt said. “There’s so many women in our community who, number one, they want it, and number two, they actually qualify for it — it’s safe for them.”
Emily Meyers said if those resources had been in place three months ago, she would have elected to give birth locally at the birth center. She and her husband likely also would have stopped at the Plumas District Hospital emergency room in Quincy. 
“A birthing center that’s 30 minutes from my house — that would be a huge relief,” Meyers said. “It was very miserable to be in labor in the car for an hour and a half. It would be nice if there were a few more options for people, and it would give me more peace of mind knowing there was more care available.”
Rural hospitals struggle to maintain labor and delivery
In 2022, the last year that Plumas District Hospital operated a maternity ward, it delivered 64 babies, barely more than one per week. When the number of births drops below 200, that’s usually a sign of trouble, Moore, with Partnership Health Plan, said.
Low volume is a common problem in rural California and one that comes with a hefty price tag. Maternity wards are often the second most expensive hospital units to run after the emergency room because they require around-the-clock staffing, and without enough births there’s no revenue to cover the service.
Plumas’ hospital also struggled with staffing issues. As a rural hospital, it needed nurses who could work in multiple areas of the hospital when women weren’t in labor; modern training has encouraged most medical professionals to specialize in a single area. 
Open nursing positions with sign-on and housing bonuses would go months without applicants, hospital leaders said. Temporary traveling nurses hired to fill on the maternity ward were unwilling to work in other areas of the hospital.
“We couldn’t throw enough money at it,” Beatty said. “We were willing to spend whatever it took to get the staffing we needed, but that wasn’t the problem.” 
Still, hospital leaders vowed to bring some birth services back to the area after closing the maternity ward. 
Plumas District Hospital kept its 24-hour operating room open and retained anesthesiologists, obstetricians and respiratory therapists on staff. Typically, when a rural hospital ends labor and delivery, it stops related services; but doctors and midwives have continued prenatal care and follow-up with moms who deliver in other cities. 
“Obstetrics really forces an organization to be very, very excellent across the board,” Beatty said. 
Birth centers gain popularity
Emily Meyers’ sister-in-law, Mary Ann Meyers, remembers when Plumas District Hospital closed its maternity ward. She had been planning on delivering her first child there in 2021 when the Dixie Fire swept through the region, burning nearly 1 million acres. The hospital was spared, but she transferred her care to a hospital in Nevada instead because of the smoke. Months later, Plumas District Hospital shut the doors to its maternity ward.
That loss complicated the birth of her second child. Mary Ann drove five hours round trip between Greenville and Reno for those prenatal appointments. 
Then, the same July day that Emily gave birth, Mary Ann found herself in labor with her third child, speeding to the same hospital. Her water broke at 2:30 a.m. She and her husband drove to Reno and had just checked into a hotel when they got a call saying Emily had delivered in the car and was also in Reno – in the Sierra Medical Center emergency room.
Mary Ann started feeling stronger contractions herself, so she and her husband rushed over to Sierra Medical too. By the time she made it up four flights of stairs to the maternity ward, Mary Ann was 9 centimeters dilated and nearly ready to push.
“We made it but I am definitely worried about next time,” Mary Ann Meyers said. “It went from zero to 100 in 40 minutes.”
Moms in the area will be excited about the new birth center, Mary Ann said. Many of her friends want natural births. Though she delivered in a hospital, she did it without an epidural.
Planned out-of-hospital births in California increased by 30% over the past decade even as birth rates overall declined, according to data from the Medical Board of California.
“If there is an emergency it’s still a little risky, but it’s good to know that there are people who are capable and knowledgeable if you need help,” Mary Ann Myers said.
Lori Link, a certified nurse midwife with Plumas District Hospital, said the plan is for obstetrics staff to routinely spend time at larger institutions, to keep up their skills. 
Link, too, is optimistic about the future of maternity care in Plumas. Many of her current patients ask about the birth center and when it will open. The plan wouldn’t be sustainable if the community didn’t want it, she said. 
“I think this is a testimony to the power of listening to women,” Link said.

The Charter Schools Program (CSP) grant was awarded before the government shutdown and will be used to support charter schools through sub-grants. APCSC said on Facebook that Alabama was one of six states to receive the grant.
“We support both our traditional schools and our charter schools. But what’s important here is giving choice to parents for what best fits the needs of their students. So we’re looking at options and choices, and we’re looking forward to giving them those things,” Searcy said.
According to the U.S. Department of Education’s website, CSP funds may be used to create new charter schools; replicate existing ones or spread information about charter schools. The department’s website states that there are also additional funds that can be used by charter schools to find facilities, reward charter schools that form “exemplary” collaborations with traditional schools and invest in national initiatives that support charter schools.
The U.S. Department of Education said on its website that the CSP grants total $500 million, making them the biggest investment in the program’s history. 
Searcy told commissioners during the Monday work session that 23 subgrants will be given to charter schools. 
In Alabama, replication is the process an existing charter school goes through to establish another facility not on the current campus that replicates the vision, mission, grade level, academic program or instructional model. Expansion is defined as a charter school opening another school not on the campus or approved school area without replication, or when an existing school expands its program beyond the grade levels outlined in the school’s charter contract on the same campus or approved school area.
“We will have seven new charter schools. Those grants will be three years. That will mean a planning year, an implementation year and an operating year,” Searcy told commissioners. “We will have four replication charter schools over a two-year period of time. We also have four expansion school opportunities. Those grants will last over two years and we will have eight conversion charter schools over a two year period.”
Searcy said at the meeting APCSC will work with a third-party consultant annually to evaluate sub grantee applications, conduct peer reviews and review new charter school applications.
The grant will also be used to hire personnel to support the charter schools in Alabama including a project director, a community communications specialist, an assistant finance manager and four part time roles.
The federal government shutdown has halted the award process for the commission, Searcy said.
“The availability of the grant is determined by when the government goes back. At this point, we know that we have received our G5 [Technical Review Form], we will be able to draw down the money, we have worked with enough of the people that are not furloughed to know that we have gotten that underway. That was not an issue. We’re hoping that the government shutdown will cease soon so that we can get back to the timeline of our charter school grant,” Searcy said.
Searcy told commissioners the grant would help improve the existing charter schools and allow new ones to come into the state.
“We were all on board with making this grant work for our charter schools and for our future charter schools. No one wanted this grant for extra pay. We wanted this grant because it was the right thing for Alabama,” she said.
Amanda Inabinett, APCSC’s Alabama State Department of Education liaison, said at the meeting she’s glad the grant was secured and is anticipating the government’s reopening.
“We worked really hard for this grant, and I’m just so glad to see it come to fruition. I won’t lie, It was a little scary, it was a little intimidating, but I think that we’re ready for it, and we’re really ready to get all the folks on board with us. So we’re just all waiting for that moment when they say the government’s open back up,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-12 08:56:37.108056

The move, some say, illustrates the cultural divide between urban and rural residents of the state.  
Commissioner Tommy Caviglia, who represents sportsmen on the nine-member Wildlife Commission, said at Saturday’s commission meeting in Washoe County that he opposed sanctioning the events, where the person who slaughters the most coyotes wins cash and prizes. 
Until now, coyote killing contests in Nevada have been unregulated – neither prohibited nor sanctioned by the state. Ranching and hunting enthusiasts contend that the wanton killing reduces the population, lessening the volume of coyotes preying on cattle and mule deer. 
But studies indicate populations are higher where coyotes are hunted because of a reproductive response triggered by decreased competition for food, resulting in larger litters born to younger mothers. 
The regulation passed Saturday requires that participants have a Nevada hunting or trapping permit, and establishes the season from Sept. 1 to March 31. 
“I do think it’s in poor taste. This is a polarizing subject. I don’t believe this language provides any benefit,” Cavigilia said, adding the controversy over killing contests is “U.S. wide. This issue is not going to go away. By defining it in a regulation, I believe we’re just pouring gasoline on the issue.”
Killing contests have been banned in most western states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington. Nevada competitions are routinely organized and advertised in those states.
Efforts to regulate killing contests in Colorado and Washington failed, with both states banning the contests outright in 2020. 
The rules “are theater,” wildlife advocate Stephanie Myers said during public comment. “They make it look like the Commission is doing something, while, in reality, they do nothing to stop these brutal contests with sordid prizes.”
Former Republican State Sen. Warren Hardy, now a lobbyist representing Humane World for Animals, called the vote “an offensive” response to Humane World’s campaign for a ban. The commission’s sanction of the contests on the heels of its rejection of a ban, he said, “sets an unprecedented precedent” and tells Nevadans “don’t bring your issues forward if we disagree with them, because if you do, there’s going to be a cost, and we’re going to do the opposite of what you asked.”
Hardy says he intends to “try to get the legislative commission to reject that insulting regulation and then back to the drawing board.” Legislative action, he says, “is likely our only recourse.”
One Nevada? 
Two of Nevada’s most populous municipalities, Clark County and the City of Reno, have passed resolutions to stop the contests. The commission, however, has held firm, despite threats of legislative action, or in the alternative, an overhaul of the commission. 
Activists argue hunting and ranching interests have a stranglehold on the commission, and by extension, on Nevada wildlife. 
“It is telling that the prescribed solutions to managing wildlife regularly imposed by this commission invariably involve the death, destruction and permanent removal of wildlife species and vegetation such as pinion juniper,” commented Boulder City resident Fred Voltz. “The ‘killing is conservation’ concept so often invoked has not served our state, its wildlife, or the majority of Nevadans who do not have an irrational bloodlust and need for domination and submission of wildlife species.”
The Wildlife Commission is made up of nine members who are appointed by the governor. The commission must have five “sportsmen,” i.e. hunters, fishermen or trappers who have purchased a license in three of the past four years, one rancher, one farmer, one conservationist, and one member of the public. 
It is the “the least democratic of all state boards or commissions which provide oversight to a public resource,” Don Molde, who battled the commission for decades until his death in July, said in 2021. “In fact, I’m not sure there is another that is so tilted.”  
Hardy suggests the Legislature “should also take a look at whether the board is representative of the full state. We are certainly not stopping the fight.”
Despite the outcome of the commission’s vote, activists were encouraged that three commissioners voted against regulation – Caviglia and newest members Liz Munn, who represents conservation, and Wyatt Mesna, who represents ranching interests. In the past, only the conservation representative has voted in line with activists’ interests. 
Those interests extend beyond killing contests to include the state’s recreational bear hunt, the mountain lion hunt, leghold trapping, “and most of all, the undemocratic composition” of the Wildlife Commission, Myers wrote in an email to supporters following the meeting.  
“Tommy Caviglia was right. We are not going away,” she said. “Our numbers will swell as more residents become aware of our issues.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dead-coyotes-1024x863.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

(Photo by Jason Getz-Pool/Getty Images)Attorney John Eastman, whose residence in Santa Fe prompted protests following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, is one of the 77 people President Donald Trump pardoned recently. That pardon protects them from any criminal legal consequences for their alleged roles in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
According to media reports and federal prosecutors, Eastman was one of two lawyers behind the effort to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of the 2020 election and to orchestrate slates of fake electors in several states to subvert the results naming former President Joe Biden as the election winner. 
Trump’s pardon attorney, Ed Martin, posted the undated list including Eastman on social media on Sunday evening. The proclamation from Trump offers an unconditional pardon to those named for conduct related to the fake electors, “as well as for any conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities in the 2020 Presidential Election.”
Jack Smith, special counsel for the Justice Department during Biden’s term, identified Eastman, along with fellow pardon recipients Rudy Giuliani and Sydney Powell, as unindicted co-conspirators in an indictment against Trump for the president’s efforts to stay in office after losing the election to Biden. 
The pardons have no immediate effect, because, as is the case with Eastman, none of the pardon recipients has been federally indicted. But the pardons preclude future presidents from bringing federal criminal cases against Eastman and others on the list, according to Politico. 
Leading up to the indictment against Trump in which Eastman was named, federal agents seized Eastman’s cell phone after confronting him in a Santa Fe restaurant parking lot, which Eastman later sued over. 
Eastman did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiries via email and phone call Tuesday.
Despite Trump’s pardon, Eastman is facing criminal charges in Arizona and Georgia for his alleged part in recruiting and organizing fake electors. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases, according to local news reports. 
After entering a not guilty plea at a court in Arizona last May, he told reporters that, “I had zero communications with the electors in Arizona [and] zero involvement in any of the election litigation in Arizona or legislative hearings,” the Associated Press reported. “And I am confident that with the laws faithfully applied, I will be fully exonerated at the end of this process.”
While the pardon does not affect local prosecutors’ cases, those cases are largely stalled, according to the Associated Press.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1938433171-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

Wendell Jones, D-Greenville, in House chambers on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024, in Columbia, S.C. (File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — As the longest federal government shutdown in history nears an end, a state representative who’s running for governor says South Carolina lawmakers need to ensure a future congressional stalemate doesn’t again threaten families’ ability to put food on the table.
The federal government usually provides 100% of the funding for grocery benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
But Rep. Jermaine Johnson plans to file a bill ahead of the upcoming legislative session to automatically provide temporary state funding to cover the food benefits for South Carolinians in any future government shutdown or pause for any other reason.
“I was one of those kids who relied on food stamps to eat,” the Hopkins Democrat said. “I know exactly what these families are facing because I lived it. That’s why I am filing a bill to make sure South Carolina families never go hungry because Washington has failed them once again.”
The draft legislation provided to the SC Daily Gazette establishes what Johnson is calling the South Carolina Nutritional Bridge Fund, which the state Department of Social Services would administer.
In the case that the U.S. Department of Agriculture announces a disruption to the SNAP program, the state agency would work through an outside contractor to load families’ normal monthly benefits onto existing debit cards using the bridge money. This would allow families to continue using their cards to buy groceries until federal funding resumes.


The bill calls for $100 million to be set aside in the budget annually until the fund reaches a balance of $500 million.
By comparison, South Carolina residents currently receive about $105 million in SNAP benefits each month. That’s across more than 260,000 households, according to DSS data.
Under the proposal, only residents already enrolled in SNAP at the time of a shutdown would continue to receive benefits through the fund.
If the account begins running low or doesn’t have enough to fully fund benefits, the state would divide the money proportionately among recipients until depleted.
The government shutdown that began Oct. 1 resulted in a suspension of food benefits for November. In South Carolina, SNAP benefits go out to recipients on a staggered schedule over the first 19 days of each month, according to a chart provided to the Gazette.
That means anyone due their monthly allotment — which last month averaged about $190 per person — between Nov. 1 and Nov. 12 has already missed out.
With the halt looming, Gov. Henry McMaster on Oct. 28 activated the One SC Fund, the state’s disaster relief fund, to collect donations and distribute them to food banks as a way to help fill the gap. But even with a record number of people donating to the fund, the aid has been a fraction of the normal benefits through SNAP.
South Carolina has a surplus of tax collections, as well as reserves, that could be tapped to help fill the gap. But only the Legislature has the authority to spend that money. And legislators aren’t scheduled to return to Columbia until mid-January.
Sen. Deon Tedder, D-Charleston, asked McMaster to force the Legislature back, but under the rules governing the off-session, he lacks that authority too. Only the chambers’ leaders can call a special session. But even if they did, a debate on how much to spend from which account — or whether to spend anything since the USDA made clear it would not reimburse states — could drag on for weeks.
It was also unclear how DSS would distribute any state money. The state’s contract with a third-party vendor covers transfers from the federal government to benefit cards. Handling state money could require a different contract.
Johnson’s bill seeks to eliminate all of those hurdles with a law that automatically triggers a transfer. It would also give DSS the authority to make any changes needed to keep the money flowing.
At least four Democrats in the state House plan to sign on as co-sponsors. Johnson plans to submit his bill when pre-filing opens Dec. 16.
But pre-filing a bill doesn’t give it any special advantage in the session that starts Jan. 13. Johnson didn’t say whether he’s gotten support, or how he hopes to get it, from Republicans who hold a supermajority in both chambers.
“D.C. dysfunction should never decide whether a child in South Carolina eats,” Johnson said. “If Washington has lost its moral compass, South Carolina will use its own. We will take care of our own and make sure no family goes hungry because politicians in Washington refuse to do their jobs.”
The longest government shutdown in history — a record set last week — is expected to end this week. But it remains unclear when full November SNAP benefits will flow.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_4632-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

For the first time in a while, there was real collaboration.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov. John Rodgers: A year of balance, progress and putting Vermonters first.","This commentary is by John Rodgers, lieutenant governor of Vermont.


As I wrap up my first year as Vermont’s lieutenant governor, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about where we’ve been — and where we’re headed. It’s no secret that folks are feeling squeezed these days. Whether it’s the cost of housing, heating fuel, health care or just keeping up with everyday expenses, Vermont’s affordability crisis is real, and it’s affecting people in every corner of our state.
But here’s the good news: this year, we proved that when Montpelier is balanced — when no one party can simply bulldoze the other — we can actually roll up our sleeves and get things done. For the first time in a while, there was real collaboration.
We passed important housing and infrastructure bills that will help get more homes built, improve local roads and water systems, and start tackling the cost drivers behind so many of our challenges. We also got the train moving on long-overdue education reform. None of it was easy, but the progress we made shows what’s possible when people from different parties sit down, listen to each other and find common ground. That’s the Vermont way.
It’s easy to get discouraged watching what’s happening in Washington, D.C. The partisanship, the gridlock, the finger-pointing — it’s enough to make anyone lose faith.
But Vermont isn’t Washington. We don’t have to act like them. We can still lead with respect, with decency and with the understanding that there’s more that unites us than divides us.
It’s going to take all of us working together to get Vermont back on track. That is why I have an open-door policy in my office and spend so much time traveling around the state listening to Vermonters. I know the best ideas come from working Vermonters. We can’t view running for office as a means to grow a career, rather it must be for the purpose of serving.
As a farmer, small business owner and community servant, I’ve seen a lot. But that doesn’t mean I do not have more to learn from you.
Over the next few weeks, I’ll be traveling around the state, visiting communities big and small and talking with Vermonters about what’s working — and what’s not. I want to hear directly from you about what a nonpartisan Montpelier can do better.
Gov. Phil Scott has set a great example of steady, practical leadership that puts people first, not politics. My goal is to keep building on that — to keep finding ways to make Vermont more affordable and more livable for everyone, no matter your class, income level, ZIP code or political stripe.
At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: a Vermont where our kids can grow up, our seniors can retire with dignity and families don’t have to move away just to make ends meet. That’s what drives me every day.
We may not agree on everything, but if we keep talking, keep listening and keep working together — I believe we can get there. Because that’s what Vermonters do best.

(Photo by Erick Doxey/InvestigateWest)When Camerina Zorrozua learned in April that Washington had slashed its state funding of her Spokane-based legal aid organization, she frantically called state Rep. Tarra Simmons.
“I was so alarmed, and I asked her straight up, ‘What happened?’” said Zorrozua, the legal director and co-founder of The Way to Justice.
Simmons, the first formerly incarcerated lawmaker in Washington, has vowed to fight for other formerly incarcerated people and was the state representative who Zorrozua thought would have fought hardest against the cuts. 
In 2021, Simmons, D-Bremerton, helped secure state funding to help hundreds of thousands of people vacate drug-related convictions from their criminal records, after the Washington Supreme Court deemed the state’s felony drug possession law to be unconstitutional in a ruling known as State v. Blake. In 2023, Simmons was able to vacate her own felony convictions. In media reports, she said it felt like she had been liberated from an “invisible prison.”

But the state Legislature’s decision in April to slash funding was a blow to organizations like The Way to Justice that have been key in providing legal support to those eligible to vacate their cases. And Simmons didn’t offer Zorrozua much of an explanation. 
“She made it seem like she didn’t know,” Zorrozua said. 
In fact, emails obtained by InvestigateWest show that, behind the scenes, Simmons supported the cuts, telling her colleagues that the state was nearly done with its work despite state data showing that only 38% of all the unconstitutional convictions had been vacated as of July 2025.
“My position about Blake legal funding is that it is wasteful regardless of which organization gets it,” Simmons wrote in an email to other lawmakers, including the chair and vice chairs of the House appropriations committee, where budget recommendations are made.
“In a time where we are in a budget shortfall and making decisions about cutting services to our most vulnerable people in WA, I do not believe community outreach to try and find class members four years after the case is a priority,” she wrote.
The emails, which state lawmakers have historically fought to be exempt from public disclosure, give a peek into the decision-making that left the impacted legal aid organizations and the state agency that doles out the funds confused and scrambling. The Office of Civil Legal Aid was originally allocated around $5 million in both the draft House and Senate biannual budgets to support its Blake-related civil legal aid efforts, but in the waning days of the legislative session, the funding disappeared from the final budget.
In State v. Blake, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the state’s simple drug possession law was unconstitutional because it lacked language related to criminal intent, effectively criminalizing even “innocent and passive possession” of drugs in violation of a person’s due process rights. The historic decision not only made Washington’s law void but also made an estimated 330,000 past misdemeanor and felony convictions dating as far back as 1971 eligible to be wiped from a person’s criminal record. The state also must refund any financial costs stemming from the convictions. The number of eligible cases is considered a significant undercount because Washington’s court system makes it difficult to gather historical conviction data.
Simmons told InvestigateWest that it wasn’t her intention to harm legal aid organizations, but given the extremely tight state budget, difficult decisions had to be made. “I’ve always fought for my community,” she said. “But my community also needs things like housing and food.”

But others have argued that the cuts were less about cost savings and more about her ongoing personal conflict with one of the state-supported legal aid organizations, Civil Survival. She served as its executive director from 2015 until she was fired from the organization in July 2024 following two separate third-party investigations that found repeated violations of the organization’s policies, according to an open letter from its Board of Directors. When the budget cuts were made, Simmons was simultaneously suing the organization, which had received around $800,000 in 2023 and 2024 to support its Blake-related work, according to state contracts. The 2023 contract was signed by Simmons.
“Those funds weren’t wasteful when she was at the organization,” said Virla Spencer, the co-founder and CEO of The Way to Justice, referring to Simmons’ time at Civil Survival. “So make it make sense.”
 Still a long way to go

On April 14, Washington state Sen. Drew Hansen sent an email to two budget analysts asking if cutting the Blake funding to the civil legal aid organizations would “do great damage.” It was two weeks before the budget was set to be finalized, during a time when every program was facing scrutiny as lawmakers scrambled to address a projected $16 billion budget shortfall.
Hansen, D-Bainbridge Island, wrote in the email that Simmons had shared with him that most of the state’s Blake-related work was “done” and that they were reaching the point of diminishing returns. Hansen, a lawyer, helped Simmons vacate her criminal record in 2023.
“I actually think my colleague may be on to something here (like, do we really need to do ‘outreach’ at the magnitudes that we’re currently doing),” Hansen wrote in an email to a budget analyst in April. “But I don’t have any expertise in this area and it’s hard for me to evaluate.”
While Simmons claimed to her fellow lawmakers that the Blake work was nearly complete, state data tells a different story.

Only 29% of eligible cases in superior courts; 10% of cases in district courts; and 36% of cases in municipal courts have been successfully vacated as of July 2025, according to a data analysis compiled by the Washington Office of Public Defense using Washington State Patrol data. The team estimates it will take another six years to vacate the remaining cases. 
In Kitsap County, which Hansen and Simmons represent, 57% of cases in Superior Court, 18% of cases in the municipal court, and 2% in the District Court have been vacated. There are approximately 6,117 cases left in the county eligible to be vacated.
Simmons told InvestigateWest that she thinks the cases that are left are for people who have either moved out of state or died, which is why she felt like the funds should be allocated elsewhere. When directed to the state data showing that only 38% of eligible cases have been vacated as of July 2025, Simmons said she still stood by her assessment. 
“Seniors need food, kids need food, Medicaid is being cut, and undocumented citizens need civil legal aid,” she said. “It just does not seem like that is the top priority.”
While some courts have been proactive in identifying and vacating eligible Blake cases, others have left it up to the individuals to navigate the convoluted system and initiate the process independently. The state has been working to streamline the process and provide more support to local courts tasked with identifying and vacating their eligible cases, but there’s still a long way to go.
The process, which has to be initiated at the court where the conviction was given, involves three distinct steps: resentencing cases that involve more than just a possession charge; vacating eligible cases off a person’s criminal record; and filing a refund request with the state’s Blake Refund Bureau once a vacate is issued, which can be anywhere from a few dollars to thousands.
Civil legal aid and reentry organizations have been critical in helping to get the word out about the historic ruling and guiding people through the legal process. According to previous state contracts, the state funding historically doled out by the state’s Office of Civil Legal Aid was specifically to fund legal services, public education campaigns and targeted services for people impacted by President Richard Nixon’s “war on drugs,” which helped fuel mass incarceration and disproportionately targeted communities of color. 
While the funding to the Office of Civil Legal Aid was cut this year, two other state agencies are still receiving funding related to Blake: the Office of Public Defense, to support counties proactively working through their Blake cases; and the Administrative Office of the Courts, which provides refunds for any legal financial obligations paid as a result of the unconstitutional conviction.
Zorrozua, from The Way to Justice, said she’s grateful for the work Rep. Simmons has done around criminal justice reforms, like helping to pass the New Hope Act, which makes it easier for a person to vacate their criminal record to improve access to housing and employment.
But Simmons is “way off base here” about Blake funding, she said.
Outreach is a critical component of Blake work, Zorrozua said. They’ve planned pop-up events, vaccination clinics and tabling at community events where they can meet people outside of a court setting to build trust.
“She’s forgetting about all of her brothers and sisters who have been through the carceral process, who don’t have the privilege to have private counsel come in and clear their records,” Zorrozua said.

In late October, Zorrozua said she assisted a man with immigration status issues who had a Blake-eligible conviction on his record. Removing the unconstitutional conviction from his record would “make a huge difference” in whether or not he wins his immigration case, she added. Since the budget cuts, the Way to Justice has had to start charging clients for its services. 
“I don’t want to wait for our clients to die to close the Blake file,” she stressed. “They are entitled to relief. They were entitled to relief years ago.”
Zorrozua said it feels as if Simmons has a short-term memory.
“Because I remember when I went into one of her campaign events, this used to be what Tarra ran on, justice for impacted communities,” she said. “She’s saying she’s focusing on immigration, housing and employment. And it’s like, how the hell don’t you see the connections between those things?”
 ‘Personal conflict’

In the email to her fellow lawmakers at the end of the 2025 legislative session, Simmons acknowledged she had a “personal conflict” with Civil Survival but stressed to her peers that she wasn’t advocating for the funding to be cut specifically from her former organization, but to all of the organizations.
Simmons was fired in 2024 from Civil Survival for repeatedly mistreating staff and violating policies, according to a statement published by the organization’s staff, and for threatening to cut off critical funding.
She later sued the organization for discrimination and wrongful termination, alleging that she didn’t receive the disability accommodations she’d requested for post-traumatic stress disorder. They reached a settlement in September 2025 for an undisclosed amount. “I got a large amount of money because they harmed me,” she said. “It’s been a very painful thing.”
Corey Guilmette, the co-executive director at Civil Survival, told InvestigateWest that they chose to settle the case with Simmons to protect the formerly incarcerated members of their staff from having to testify in court.
“We are dedicated to helping our community heal and continuing litigation that would force not only directly impacted staff members, but community members, including people in prison, to confront their trauma in a courtroom, did not advance that mission,” he said. 
Guilmette said the state funding cuts caused them to lay off staff attorneys. 
“We pretty much have to turn away two-thirds of clients, because if we say yes to any more than that, we know that we won’t be able to serve people adequately,” he said.

In the run-up to the 2020 election, all 20 Democratic presidential candidates promised voters they’d pursue bold changes to health care, such as a government-run insurance plan or expanding Medicare to cover every American.
Fast-forward to the congressional stalemate that has closed the federal government for more than a month. Democrats, entrenched on one side of the legislative battle, staked their political future on merely preserving parts of the Affordable Care Act — a far cry from the systemic health policy changes that party members once described as crucial for tackling the high price of care.
Democrats succeeded in focusing national attention on rising health insurance costs, vowing to hold up funding for the federal government until a deal could be made to extend the more generous tax subsidies that have cut premiums for Obamacare plans. Their doggedness could help them win votes in midterm elections next year.
But health care prices are rocketing, costly high-deductible plans are proliferating, and 4 in 10 adults have some form of health care debt. As health costs reach a crisis point, a yawning gulf exists between voters’ desire for more aggressive action and the political urgency in Washington for sweeping change.
“There isn’t a lot of eagerness among politicians,” said Jonathan Gruber, an economist who played a key role in drafting the ACA. “Why aren’t they being more bold? Probably scars from the ACA fights. But health care is a winning issue. The truth is we need universal coverage and price regulation.”
Voters rank lowering health care costs as a top priority, above housing, jobs, immigration, and crime, according to a September poll by Hart Research Associates for Families USA, a consumer health advocacy group.
And costs are climbing. Premiums for job-based health insurance rose 6% in 2025 to an average of $26,993 a year for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers released Oct. 22 by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. For all the attention given to grocery, gas, and energy prices, health premiums and deductibles in recent years have risen faster than overall inflation and wages.
Democratic headwinds
The appetite for big, bold ideas to drive down such high costs has waned in part because Democrats lack political leverage, according to economists, political strategists, and health care advocates. They’ve also been burned before for backing significant changes.
After the ACA was enacted in 2010, for example, a backlash over the law — and its mandate that most everyone have insurance — helped Republicans win the House and gain seats in the Senate. In 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton backed the public option, a proposed government-run plan that would compete against commercial insurance. She lost to Donald Trump.
Democrats are also outnumbered in Congress. Sweeping changes to health care, such as the creation of Medicaid and Medicare and passage of the ACA, historically have occurred when one party has controlled both Congress and the presidency. Republicans currently have all that muscle. So for now, Democrats are fighting to preserve the status quo while portraying Republicans as a threat to Americans’ insurance coverage.
If the ACA subsidies aren’t extended, many of the roughly 24 million people who buy coverage on the health law’s marketplaces will see their premiums more than double next year, according to KFF. A KFF Health Tracking Poll released Nov. 6 found that three-quarters of the public supported extending them.
“There’s no doubt people believe the current system needs reform,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “Protecting people from premium increases is part of that. You don’t win the future by losing the present.”
Even bipartisan legislative proposals aimed at lowering health costs have fizzled in an environment defined by political threats and partisan social media attacks.
Bills that would have improved health care price transparency and reined in companies that manage prescription drug benefits gained traction in late 2024 as part of a spending package. Then Elon Musk, who was serving as a senior adviser to President-elect Trump, took to his social media platform, X, to rally opposition, deriding the budget bill for what he asserted was excessive government spending.
GOP leaders dropped the health provisions, prompting Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to say on X that Musk “tweeted to kill” the bipartisan health policies that Congress had hammered out.
But Democrats’ focus on health care has cut both ways. Their messaging amid efforts to save the ACA from repeal and to preserve the law’s protections for those with preexisting conditions helped the party take back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. “I still have PTSD from the experience,” Republican Mike Johnson, now the House speaker, said recently.
And voters want relief. Six in 10 Americans are extremely or very worried about health care costs rising next year, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.
Hagen Wenzek, 56, is among them. The chief executive of GI Digital, a high-tech startup, felt a pain in his calf in late summer and asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT what it might be. It suggested he could have deep-vein thrombosis, or a blood clot. He went to the emergency room and obtained an ultrasound that confirmed the diagnosis, so doctors monitored him and gave him blood thinners.
His insurance was billed $7,422, and Wenzek got a bill for $890. The average cost of an ultrasound is about $400 without insurance, according to GoodRx, a digital health platform.
“The hospital is making thousands for a procedure that costs $500. It’s kind of ridiculous,” said Wenzek, of Sleepy Hollow, New York. “I have a $40 copay just to go see a doctor for anything, and I’m on a startup budget.”
‘Defending the Status Quo’
The lack of bolder ideas to tackle spiraling costs could also work against Democrats, some critics say. Comedian and political commentator Jon Stewart, in an episode of his podcast in October, accused Democrats of committing “malpractice” by not presenting ideas to fix what people hate about the health care system. Instead, he said, they’re shutting the government down to protect a system that voters already believe is failing them.
“Once again, the Democrats are in a position of defending the status quo of policies that most people in the United States think suck,” he said. “Meanwhile, on the same day, Trump rolls out TrumpRx. Hey, I’ll just threaten Pfizer with 100% tariffs and then just open up a prescription drug outside of the middle managers and sell directly to the public at a discount.”
TrumpRx, which is intended to help patients find lower-priced drugs, and pledges by Big Pharma to lower drug prices could help the GOP with voters, though Democrats are also hammering Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the bill the president signed into law in July that reduces Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over a decade.
Republicans are promising fixes, using the shutdown to try to leverage voter frustration. Vice President JD Vance said on Newsmax in October that “we do have a plan, actually,” in reference to a question about health care reform. (Trump has promised repeatedly that he would produce a plan to replace the ACA but never has.)
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on CNBC in October that Trump wants to overhaul the ACA and “give people health insurance that is higher-quality and more affordable.”
The White House did not respond to an email requesting comment from Vance.
“It’s not that Democrats are focusing on tax credits to the exclusion of bigger, bolder reforms,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA. “If you can get the conversation on health care, if we can prevent premiums from spiking, then we can focus on why health care costs so darn much to begin with.”
But some Democrats say voters are hurting and want bigger and bolder ideas now. Earlier this year, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on the podcast “Fast Politics” that the party needs to offer more on health care in the next election.
“I’ll tell you what people are going to expect,” he said. “They’re not going to expect us to tinker around the edge with the ACA. They’re going to expect universal health care.”
For now, at least, there are more innovative ideas in states. Oregon has established a governing board to set up a single-payer health system in which the state would take on health care financing — eliminating private insurance, premiums, and all deductibles for all residents as soon as 2027. The question is whether it will work. Vermont abandoned a similar effort in 2014.
“With the political environment we’re in, there isn’t currently an appetite for big reform, but we know it needs to happen,” said Mona Shah, the senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health advocacy group. “Across party lines, people want government intervention in health care and people want universal coverage. The pain point that people are feeling, the public sentiment is where we were at before the ACA.”

(Getty Images)Parents of autistic children — and ABA therapy providers — may soon encounter new usage limits, reimbursement rates and other changes as Indiana attempts to slow rising Medicaid spending.
About 20 recommendations, released Wednesday morning by a state-backed panel, could shape upcoming service shifts for thousands of Hoosiers.
“There will still be growth, just not as much, and it still protects the current ABA access for children and families who need it,” said Eric Miller, the deputy secretary and chief of staff for the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.

Miller was among the nearly two-dozen state leaders, health professionals and others charged with evaluating “cost containment” strategies that “minimize” the negative impact on enrollees. Gov. Mike Braun directed FSSA to organize the working group in a February executive order.
Applied behavior analysis, or ABA, therapy is often used to improve communication and learning skills in children and young adults with autism or other developmental disorders.
Its popularity has surged in recent years. More than 8,000 Hoosiers rely on Medicaid to pay for ABA therapy, with most of them between three and eight years of age.
“This is something that’s very valuable — but at the same time, we know it’s unsustainable, the current cost trajectory,” said Miller. His agency, FSSA, administers the state’s Medicaid program.
Two of Miller’s own children have benefitted from ABA therapy.
Other recommendations are meant to boost quality and improve oversight, in response to a revealing federal audit.
Program updates on the way — again
Indiana’s Medicaid program began covering ABA services in 2016, spending about $21 million over the following year.
Expenditures peaked at $611 million in 2023, and dropped slightly to $445 million in 2024, after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration set lower reimbursement rates.
His FSSA also moved to limit services.


A Medicaid State Plan Amendment, which was set to take effect April 1, would’ve capped treatment to 30 hours weekly for three years — retroactively. That would have cut off about half of the children using the service immediately.
Braun’s administration pulled that proposal.
“The governor decided this was cruel and unusual punishment, and we weren’t going to do that,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said.
The agency filed another State Plan Amendment, with a July 1 effective date, that would’ve raised weekly limits for enrollees with higher needs — and applied prospectively. But it’s also getting scrapped.
FSSA plans to use Wednesday’s findings to draw up a new slate of changes.
Without intervention, costs could reach an estimated $825 million in 2029. Officials say that the state can’t afford that.

“The working group and the whole package of recommendations … is projected to reduce that annual growth rate (to) around 7%-8% instead of 13%,” Miller said.
There’s no dollar amount in anticipated savings available yet, however.
“We don’t make these choices in a vacuum, right? We provide services to 1.8 million people,” Roob said.
The agency plans to bring an ABA proposal — and a new Medicaid revenue forecast — to the State Budget Committee in December.
It could submit an updated State Plan Amendment to the federal government by the end of the year. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must approve the modifications for them to take effect.
Key usage, rate changes
The working group recommended doing away with weekly limits and tiers of care on “comprehensive” ABA therapy, opting to instead pose a “lifetime” allocation of 4,000 hours.
That is fewer hours than the previous proposals would’ve allowed over a three-year period, but it is more flexible, Miller emphasized — and it’s not retroactive.
Once that cap is hit, enrollees would be eligible for up to 15 hours of “targeted” therapy per week.
Cuts to reimbursement rates for one-on-one therapy are likely, although the group didn’t agree on a specific number or range to endorse in the report.
“FSSA may reduce current rates for individual ABA therapy as deemed necessary to stay within the agency’s appropriated budget,” the recommendation reads.
Rates for group therapy, however, may be raised.

The state’s “significantly” lower reimbursement has driven low utilization, the working group found.
Hiking rates to “financially viable” levels would promote “one-on-one therapy time for children with the most significant needs, while providing a cost-effective, appropriate ‘step-down’ option for others.”
Decisions on rates are expected closer to FSSA’s presentation before the State Budget Committee next month, according to Miller.
Parents could also be required to get involved in their children’s therapy. The working group recommended nine to 18 hours of coaching or training per six-month authorization period.
“This therapy is usually done (outside) the home, which means the parent … can choose to be less engaged,” Roob said. “If the taxpayer’s spending that much money on helping this child, we believe that parent or caregiver needs to be engaged.”

Other recommendations seek to help children transition out of comprehensive care, when appropriate, and move on to lower-intensity or alternative forms of support.
“It’s (about) what’s next for the child … once they graduate (from) ABA therapy,” Miller said.
He recalled transition planning beginning “almost immediately” for his children, like if they’d continue being home-schooled or move on to public or private schools. Therapy activities can change depending on those goals, Miller noted.
FSSA has been following cohorts of enrollees who began therapy in 2020, according to the report, and found “no observable decline” in average weekly hours after three years of care.
Accreditation, location changes for providers
Indiana has more than ABA 320 therapy locations, per the report. The number of providers shot up by 25% between just 2023 and 2025.
The state currently doesn’t require any accreditation or licensure for ABA therapy organizations to bill Medicaid — or have any other limits on provider growth.
The working group agreed that should change.
“We really saw that there was an increased need for that oversight to ensure that the growing number of providers really are providing high-quality ABA therapy,” Miller said.
The report suggested requirements cover quality, service ratios and outcomes monitoring; risk management and patient safety; and more.
Story continues below.
EO 25-31 ABA Working Group Recommendations Final
 
The state could use an existing accreditation body like the Autism Commission on Quality, or an external vendor. Miller said there have been “pre-conversations” with ACQ.
“What I would say is, over the next month or two, we’d be putting the details out there, and then it’s probably like a yearlong process, because we’ve got to go through all the providers,” he added.
The working group also took aim at areas with overly high concentrations of ABA sites in hopes of encouraging expansion in underserved communities.
Sites are mostly in urban locations in central and northern Indiana, with “noticeably fewer” providers southwest.
Under one recommendation, FSSA would request federal approval to temporarily block new providers or sites in designated counties from billing to Medicaid. The six-month moratorium could be extended.
The agency would “evaluate the implications” to avoid unwanted consequences, like providers establishing sites in neighboring counties that serve the same areas or starting in-home ABA services.
In the meantime, FSSA would create “incentives” for providers to expand to areas with fewer options. It’s unclear what form those strategies might take, however.
“To be determined,” FSSA spokesman Marcus Barlow wrote.
Other strategies
Private insurers took some heat in the report, too.
“Evidence suggests that, in general, private insurers pay below Medicaid rates for ABA,” working group members wrote. They asserted that’s creating “perverse incentives” for providers to prefer Medicaid-covered children. And, Medicaid has to pay the difference between the private and public rates for those who have both insurance types.
Braun’s administration should consider supporting legislation to require group health insurers to adopt a rate schedule above Medicaid rates, they recommended. Group plans are purchased by employers from state-regulated insurance carriers. However, 70% of Hoosiers with private insurance have employer-funded plans, which are regulated at the federal level.
The working group additionally recommended that Indiana beef up its third-party liability processes, which the Medicaid program uses to identify and collect payments from other responsible parties — like private insurance companies. The report emphasized that those insurers are the primary payer when coverage exists, with Medicaid being the “payer of last resort.”
Under another recommendation, FSSA would work with schools on their responsibilities. When ABA is medically necessary, Medicaid or private insurance funds it, but when the therapy is a behavioral support, schools fund it. State rules and federal law guarantee disabled children the right to a free and appropriate public education.
Does the state’s Open Door law apply to the ABA working group?

The report calls for FSSA to create a dedicated program office within the agency, which could implement many of the suggested strategies.
Right now, a trio of divisions hold ABA-related responsibilities, according to the report. One is the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning.
“Their job is to pay claims,” Roob said. “A claim comes in; they pay it, right? That’s what they’re told to do, right? They’re not told to be managing a program. They’re paying a claim.”
The new entity would have staff with clinical expertise, too.
There’s no set timeline. Miller said FSSA would start “as soon as we can find a qualified person” and build it out from there.
Several of the recommendations the program office could handle focus on improving service quality and fighting waste, fraud and abuse.
In a 2024 report, the U.S. Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General audited Indiana’s 2019 and 2020 ABA payments and found $56 million in improper payments and an additional $78 million in potentially improper payments. It recommended that Indiana refund more than $39 million to the federal government.
The audit cited problems with documentation, diagnostic evaluations, staff credentials, referrals and more. Cheaper group work was charged as more expensive individual therapies, or billed time included non-therapeutic activities like meal and bathroom breaks, for example.
FSSA is auditing the claims identified in the federal report and requiring refunds of any identified overpayments, according to the working group. The agency also initiated a program integrity review of Medicaid claims paid for ABA therapy from 2022 through 2025, and when it’s done, will make providers refund overpayments and go through compliance training.

I just love seeing their smiling, hopeful faces, watching them grow and learn, and welcoming the trust and love they bring to us every day.
At the same time, working in this field can be challenging. Babies and young children require a great deal of love and care, informed by expertise in early childhood development. Low pay is challenging for providers, and high costs are challenging for families.
But some states are looking for answers — and I believe mine has found one. New Mexico is now expanding its free, high-quality child care program so that all families can access it. It’s the first of its kind in the nation — and I hope other states will follow.
As of November 1, all families in the state are eligible for universal, no-cost child care. New facilities will be built, existing child care centers can apply for funds to improve their facilities, and child care providers will receive pay boosts.
Prior to this, our no-cost child care was available only to families with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty line, and there were cost-prohibitive copay structures. This meant that we had to turn away many needy families.
When parents and caretakers can’t get child care, they lose work, educational opportunities, and enrichment opportunities for their kids. Or when families scrape to afford the exorbitant cost of child care, the rest of their budget — such as food, housing, healthcare, and educational expenses — suffers.
The purpose of this new, no-cost, universal child care program is many-fold: to improve early childhood education outcomes; to support parents’ ability to work; to provide child care workers with a livable wage; to increase the number and quality of child care centers; and to reduce the cost burden to families and strengthen communities.
Families will save an average of $12,000 per year with this program. That’s life-changing money for most working families. The universal program is funded by surplus revenues from New Mexico’s oil and gas industry and a portion of the Land Grant Permanent Fund — and the funds are paid directly to child care facilities.
I’ve been a teacher in the child care space for 25 years — and I’ve witnessed firsthand the problems this new program is meant to address.
I feel heartbroken each time we have to turn away a family who is desperate for care but can’t afford it. I see the positive impact our child care programs have on children, including lifelong benefits for their physical and emotional well-being and for their future educational and workforce attainment.
Former students who are now adults regularly reach out to me and thank me for all the care they remember receiving. I’m humbled by each act of thoughtfulness from these now successful adults. Recently, one family for whom I taught all five of their children invited me to be the guest of honor at a graduation for one of the adult children. I can’t put into words how special and appreciated that made me feel.
Child care centers are pillars of the community, providing an excellent start in life for our children, freeing up parents and caretakers to earn a living, and strengthening the economy and well-being of our communities. It’s a travesty that child care is prohibitively expensive — and that child care workers are woefully underpaid in the rest of the country.
Taking care of our children and setting them up for success is the best thing we can do for our families, our communities, and our nation. My hope is that all states will follow New Mexico’s lead and enact a similar, no-cost universal child care program for all families.

(Courtesy photo)Six Hoosier school communities sought to pass referendums in the most recent election. Five succeeded, and one fell short. Yet just a few weeks earlier, postcards went out to constituents all across Indiana in which state representatives touted the 5% increase in K-12 funding last session as the “highest funding level to date for Hoosier students.” 
In addition, the postcards claimed that the latest educational results prove that Indiana is leading the way by “putting students first.” To be clear, adding even one penny to last year’s budget would also produce “the highest funding level to date.” While we at the Indiana Coalition for Public Education celebrate the successes of our public schools and the hard work of educators and students, we urge Hoosiers to look beyond the glossy postcard for a fuller picture. 
While the highest dollar amount for K-12 education funding may have emerged from last session, it is not the highest level of funding we have seen. Ball State University Economist Michael Hicks has written that currently, when adjusted for inflation, “in K-12 we are spending $100 less per student each year today than in 2010.” Also, in 2024, the Education Data Initiative reported that Indiana ranks 37th of 50 states in education spending per pupil. 
Fewer Resources, more subsidies 
Alongside the lack of budget support for public schools, bills passed last session are poised to reduce public education funding. A property tax overhaul, SEA1, will cut the revenue that public schools rely upon for transportation, capital projects, and referendums. Another new law will require public school districts to share their property taxes with charter schools — publicly funded, privately run entities — further draining resources. While Indiana struggles to pay teachers a competitive salary during a teacher shortage, these priorities do not add up. 
Last session, lawmakers lifted the income cap on Indiana’s largest voucher program, making millionaires and billionaires eligible to receive taxpayer-funded subsidies for their private school tuition payments. More students are now getting a smaller piece of a shrinking education pie. Last school year alone, nearly a half billion dollars went to voucher schools, which legally don’t have to account for where the money goes. 
Literacy is foundational to all learning, and early childhood education is foundational to all educational outcomes. Yet, while our legislature gave K-12 vouchers to the wealthiest Hoosier children for their private school tuition, they simultaneously took away vouchers for child care and slashed access to state-funded preschool for many of our most vulnerable kids. 
Accountability for public school funding
While we celebrate the progress of Hoosier students and the dedication that got them back to pre-pandemic-level scores on the IREAD test, we should recognize the impact of outside dollars poured into improving reading. Much of the touted gains in literacy were made possible thanks to the $2.9 billion distributed to Indiana by the federal government to help in recovery from the pandemic and learning “loss.” Additionally, students benefited from generous private funds from the Lilly Endowment for literacy. Money does matter. 
The aforementioned postcard also highlighted Indiana as ranking third in a Parent Power category by an organization promoting “school choice.” Hoosier parents overwhelmingly choose to send their children to public schools. Parents know the value of strong public schools. It is time for them to use their voices, their power, to ensure that the state funds and supports the public schools every child deserves. It is time to ask why we must vote locally to tax ourselves through referendums when the state fails to meet its constitutional obligation to ensure our public schools have what they need—while opportunity gaps widen for Hoosier kids. 
We celebrate the recent rise in test scores, as well as the magic that happens every day in our public schools. Yet, we also look to the future with concern and hope. Public schools are the heart of our communities — places that unite us across all backgrounds, accept all students, and empower our kids to become contributing members of our society. True commitment to “putting students first” means fully investing in our public schools so that every Hoosier child can thrive.

(Photo by Getty Images)Chuck Johnson raises timely issues in his Reformer commentary, “Time to rethink human services as Trump administration dumps costs on counties.”
Minnesota’s human service system is facing a crisis, and policy makers should seize the opportunity to rethink state and county roles.  
The state-supervised, county-delivered structure we rely on today was developed nearly a century ago, in the era of pen and paper, when the most practical way to apply for public assistance was to walk into a county office and fill out forms in person. 
But the world has changed dramatically. 
Today, Minnesotans expect services that are simple, fast and accessible online — anytime, from anywhere. The county office is no longer as convenient as the phone in our pocket. It is time to rethink how we structure and deliver human services across the state.
Human services programs touch nearly every Minnesotan at some point in life. 
The system supports parents caring for young children; adults struggling with mental health or substance use; seniors who need help remaining in their homes; people with disabilities who want to live independently; and families seeking food or housing stability during difficult times. 
These are not abstract programs. They support our neighbors, our co-workers, and often our own families. A well-functioning system strengthens families and communities and reduces long-term public costs. 
But when the system is confusing, slow, or fragmented, the consequences can be profound both for the Minnesotans seeking help and for the public resources that sustain them.
The core challenge of the state-county system is the disconnect between the Legislature, state agencies and county governments. 
The Legislature writes the laws. 
State agencies interpret, manage, and supervise them. 
Counties are responsible for delivering the services directly to residents. 
Over time, layers of well-intentioned rules and safeguards have accumulated, often in response to specific concerns or headlines. Each layer adds complexity — with new forms, verification steps, or reporting requirements. The result is a system that is difficult for residents to navigate and expensive to administer. County staff who want to help people instead spend hours verifying paperwork, chasing documentation, and ensuring compliance with sometimes contradictory requirements. 
Historically, the Legislature and state agencies did not feel the urgency to invest in better county technology or streamlined administrative processes, perhaps because by virtue of their roles they do not see the day-to-day inefficiencies that seep into the county budgets. We believe that is changing, as evidenced by the $40 million investment in updating one system last year — but there are many more systems that need the same attention.
For example, counties have estimated that just four areas of inefficiency — duplicate data entry, manual renewals, inefficient programming, and manual notices sent to clients because of system errors — cost more than $23 million per year in staff time.
Compounding the challenge, Minnesota counties are facing a tsunami of new “cost shares” from both federal and state governments, and we are struggling to stay afloat. This method of reducing state and federal budgets does not reduce the overall cost of the programs. It just shifts the cost down to property taxes instead of state and federal taxes. 
These challenges are why counties agree that it is time for the Legislature to invest in a comprehensive review of state and county responsibilities. 
This review should examine which services are best delivered consistently and centrally — through statewide systems, shared technology platforms, or uniform processes — and which are most effective when localized and tailored to community needs. 
For example, eligibility determinations and routine administrative processes may be more efficient if standardized statewide. 
In contrast, services like child protection, behavioral health coordination, and support for older adults often require close relationships with local providers, schools, law enforcement and community organizations. 
The goal should not be to shift everything to one level or another, but to align responsibility with the level of government best equipped to deliver high-quality service.
Counties are eager to be partners in this work. We see the strain on frontline staff, on families navigating complex requirements, and on property taxpayers funding a system that has not been updated to match modern needs. We also recognize the commitment of the Legislature and state agencies, who share our goal of serving Minnesotans effectively and responsibly.
Our state has a history of innovation and collaboration in public service. Our state-supervised, county-administered system was the right choice for Minnesotans when it was created. 
Now, we have an opportunity now to create a more streamlined and sustainable system — one that meets people where they are, reduces administrative burden, and uses public resources wisely.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/old-personcane-GettyImages-946924536-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-12 07:58:38.509283

(Photo by George Wuerthner).Prescribed burning is often promoted as a magic bullet that can prevent large wildfires, but it has several disadvantages that are seldom discussed.

The presumed purpose of the National Prescribed Fire Act 2025 is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires by investing in managing hazardous fuels. The legislation would accelerate and expand the use of prescribed burns during cooler, wetter months.
The legislation also includes a clause increasing the percentage of federal land on which prescribed burns occur each year. The legislation requires that the acreage burned be increased by 10% more than the amount burned in previous years.
While the goal is admirable—to reduce wildfire threats to communities—the assertion that such prescribed burns can reduce “catastrophic” fires is delusional. It displays the faulty expectations inherent in the legislation.
Large, so-called “catastrophic” blazes occur only when the right combination of climate and weather conditions exists. Extreme fire weather requires severe drought, low humidity, high temperatures, and, most importantly, high winds.
Fires that ignite under less-than-extreme fire weather conditions usually burn a small acreage and often self-extinguish, with or without fire suppression. In the United States, 98% of the fires never burn more than 300 acres.
On the other hand, if you have high winds—the conditions that lead to “catastrophic” blazes, prescribed burns don’t stop fire spread. Wind will blow embers over or around any area of a prescribed burn.
High winds regularly blow embers over lands without fuel, such as 16-lane freeways or across mile-wide rivers, as the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire did in the Columbia Gorge.
The second problem with the proposal is that you can’t predict where a fire will occur. On all U.S. Forest Service lands across the conterminous U.S., 6.2% of prescribed fire-treated areas from 2003–2022 encountered a subsequent wildfire in 2004–2023.
However, this statistic is deceptive. Just because a fire encountered a treated area does not mean the treatment had any effect on fire spread.
Beware of the time factor. For example, a study of smoke emissions in treated areas compared to untreated areas, showed a 14% reduction in particulate matter. However, the study focused on prescribed burns two years old or less. No one doubts that if a fire encounters a prescribed burn shortly after treatment, it can sometimes have an influence.
The effectiveness of fuel reductions declines over time. In many instances, burning or thinning promotes new plant growth. Often, within a few years, you may have more fuel than before treatment.
What grows back is dominated by “fine fuels” like grasses and shrubs. These fuels are more “flammable” than trees, large branches, logs, and other debris that may have existed prior to prescribed fire. So, prescribed burns can alter the fuel composition, increasing the likelihood of burning.
The only solution to this problem of plant regrowth is frequent burning. Depending on the plant community, one may need to reburn it every few years to preclude the creation of higher fuel loads. To be effective, you must continue the prescribed burning forever.
This means citizens must be ready to accept smoke as a nearly year-round inconvenience and health hazard.
I cannot delve into the entire flawed argument that “a hundred years of fire suppression” has led to fuel buildups or that Indian burning precluded large wildfires that proponents use to justify burns, but I encourage readers to consult my commentary on this issue.
The strategic use of prescribed burns near homes and communities may have some utility, but the advantages are grossly exaggerated. Given the many disadvantages, whether this is worth the costs is rarely discussed. Ultimately, we must address climate change, which is the underlying cause of large wildfires and hardened homes, so they are less vulnerable to any wildfire ignitions.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Wisconsin Democrats have announced a bill that would cap residential energy bills at 2% of household income. 
On Tuesday, Democrats said the proposal from Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee) would protect Wisconsinites’ bank accounts while the state finds ways to expand clean energy production in the face of climate change and manage the increasing energy burden posed by data center developments across the state. 
“Rising energy rates are becoming an unsustainable burden on regular people in Wisconsin,” Madison said at a Tuesday morning press conference. “Our energy system still has big problems to tackle, like dramatically moving towards carbon-free electricity, or the challenge of data centers, which are currently on course to double the amount of energy creation in Wisconsin. Regardless of your stance on data centers, artificial intelligence and the role these technologies can or should play in our communities, the people of Wisconsin must have their energy burden lifted. This bill is a common sense, necessary protection for people struggling to afford their basic needs before we take further action on any of these things as legislators to address those issues.”
At the press conference, residents who have struggled with energy bills spoke about how getting power disconnected can reverberate through people’s lives, causing health problems or forcing choices between other household costs. 
“We’re doing everything we can, yet we still cannot keep up,” said Jill Sexton, a Wausau resident who is on disability assistance with a husband on Social Security. “I ended up taking a part time job specifically to cover the increase in our electric and heating bills. Nowadays, here’s our reality: Each month we choose between paying the electric bill and heat bill or filling our prescriptions. Some months I don’t buy the medication. Some months we stretch food until the very last day.”
Several lawmakers tied the bill to the national Democratic party’s growing focus on “affordability” and bipartisan skepticism of data centers. 
“We have the money. It’s all about how we prioritize where we spend it,” Rep. Ryan Spaude (D-Ashwaubenon) said at the press conference. “Folks in my district and around the state are on a knife’s edge. Many of them are just barely getting by. This bill is going to do something. It’s going to keep more money in their pockets. It deserves a hearing and it deserves to be passed by this body.” 
Legislators announced the bill just as communities are grappling with the construction of massive data centers across the state. While the centers can provide an easy source of property tax revenue for local governments, they also use a massive amount of water and energy — raising questions about the protection of local water supplies, adequacy of the state’s existing renewable energy sources and concerns that a data center-generated spike in energy use will be passed on to local ratepayers. 
Last week, Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) introduced a bill that would require data centers to cover the cost of increased energy use, mandate the development of more clean energy and ensure data center construction pays local workers living wages. 
“While our state energy system faces deep uncertainty, especially when it comes to the climate crisis, we’re responding to data centers that are going to have increasing energy demands and raise rates for many communities,” said Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) who is running in the Democratic primary for governor. “It is vital that we cap all utility payments at 2% of income so that we can protect our ratepayers and our communities first. This bill is a clear and systemic practical response to rising energy rates, and it’s one of the key cornerstone priorities of the Assembly Democrats’ affordability agenda.”
Under the rate cap bill, the Public Service Commission would be responsible for administering an energy burden relief fund. The fund would cover the difference for any household with energy costs that are more than 2% of the monthly household income. The bill would give the PSC 12 months after enactment to start the fund and three years to automatically enroll every eligible household. 
The bill would allow the PSC to prioritize households making less than 300% of the federal poverty level, only provide payments to cover energy costs for primary residences and provide a maximum energy use threshold to prevent people from receiving state aid for energy intensive home businesses such as mining cryptocurrency. 
Also, the bill would prevent public utility companies from disconnecting the service of people making less than 300% of the federal poverty level and require the PSC to annually report the number of utility disconnections.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wisconsin-farm-with-wind-turbine.jpg,,,2025-11-12 06:57:20.618775

(Photo by Amanda Brown/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s cannabis industry would see a host of changes under a new bill from Senate President Nicholas Scutari.
The measure would allow some medical marijuana dispensaries to sell recreational cannabis without getting an OK from local leaders, loosen ethics requirements for state cannabis regulators, and strip the governor of the power to name the chair of the state panel that regulates the industry.
Scutari (D-Union) has proposed some of this before, in a bill he introduced in January that never advanced in the Senate. Scutari, who is a major supporter of legalized cannabis, did not return a request for comment on the new bill.
One of the major changes in the new measure, introduced last week, would allow medical marijuana dispensaries to apply for a license to sell recreational cannabis without municipal approval. The bill would allow this even in towns that have banned recreational dispensaries.
When New Jersey legalized cannabis, it allowed towns to opt out of the recreational marijuana industry, and about 70% of them did. Some limit sales to medical cannabis only.
The number of people enrolled in the state’s medical marijuana program has dwindled since cannabis became more readily available for people older than 21. Recreational users can purchase most cannabis products available at medical dispensaries, which was not the case when the industry launched more than three years ago.
The bill also seeks to change oversight rules for the five-member Cannabis Regulatory Commission by loosening restrictions on commissioners’ political activity and modifying rules that regulate when they can speak to people who have applications before the panel.
The measure would allow commission members and employees to attend political events with written notice by a member or the executive director. Commission members are already permitted to hold public office, but the bill has a provision explicitly allowing them to campaign for office and fundraise for those campaigns. 
Current law bars commission members from meeting with anyone who has applications or other matters before the panel except at the agency’s offices. The bill would end that ban and allow commissioners and employees of the agency to meet with people who have business before the agency at any locations designated by the commission.
While all those meetings would be required to be logged, they would not be subject to the state’s public meetings law unless they are attended by more than one person on the commission. Joshua Bachner, a cannabis attorney at Mandelbaum Barrett in Roseland, said this invites malfeasance.
“I don’t see how this is good at all, for anyone,” Bachner said. “This is opening up the floodgates for misconduct.”
Bachner also noted a provision of the bill would allow state employees and their family members to work in the cannabis industry, as long as state ethics officials or the New Jersey Supreme Court say it wouldn’t create a conflict of interest, or the “reasonable risk of the public perception” of one.
In 2023, New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner barred state courts employees from taking any jobs in the medical or recreational cannabis industry.
The bill would also increase commissioners’ salaries from $125,000 to $160,000 and the chair’s salary from $141,000 to $156,000.
The measure comes in the waning days of the current legislative session and Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration. Murphy, who leaves office on Jan. 20, campaigned in his first term on legalizing recreational cannabis. Voters approved legalization via a ballot question, and the first recreational dispensaries launched in April 2022.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rec_mari12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 06:57:20.618775

(Photo by Christina Lords/Idaho Capital Sun)In some of Idaho’s more rural communities, a public library can be the only source of reliable internet, a free meeting or study place, or the only place to get a book without having to order online. 
But to build or renovate a new library can be a herculean task when relying on a limited pool of funding from the small population. A few Gem State towns are celebrating, or getting ready to soon celebrate, the accomplishment of this task thanks to the support from their communities and library grant funding. 
Kendrick, Inkom and Fernwood are a few recent examples of small communities that got a new public library. 
 Kendrick’s new library to serve Juliaetta too amid closure of old building 

The north central Idaho community of Juliaetta had hosted and strongly supported a public library for years, but the more than 100-year old building was small and inaccessible to many people, according to Latah County Library District Director April Hernandez. 
“It’s been an issue for a long time,” Hernandez said. “We had a lot of patrons who couldn’t access the building.” 
Talks began to find a new site or building more than 20 years ago, she said.

“The library board, especially at that time, felt that Juliaetta had supported the library so well, they didn’t want to move it out of town, and so they spent 20 years looking for an alternative in Juliaetta to use,” she said. 
About three miles away, in Kendrick, an old bank building came on the market. The district bought it in November 2024. 
The city of Juliaetta had sold a park and raised donations for a new library amid the start of the search for a new building 20 years ago, Hernandez said. The district received $22,000 from that account and about $10,000 in a grant from the Latah County Library Foundation. In total, the district garnered almost $43,000 in grants and donations. 
The new library, located at 501 Main St., opened earlier this month. 
The single-floor building doesn’t require a ramp and is much more accessible, Hernandez said. It also has a meeting space with a kitchenette. The library district is in the process of widening the building’s Wi-Fi so it’s usable in the adjacent park. 
“I think that’s one of the big things for those areas, is connectivity, because cell service isn’t always real great down in the valley … and then Wi-Fi is expensive and hard to get in some locations,” Hernandez said. “So having that available in a wide array around the library, I think it’s important for a lot of people to be able to have any access to Wi-Fi at all.”

 Inkom library branch opens in response to population growth in area

Inkom, located just southeast of Pocatello, has been experiencing a lot of growth in recent years, but well before that, former South Bannock Library District Director Marcy Price had been working to open a branch in the area, according to the library district’s current director Megan Short. 
The town had only been served by a bookmobile previously, according to a past commentary piece in the Idaho Capital Sun by Michael Strickland. 
Multiple deals fell through, but a land swap with the Marsh Valley Joint School District finally provided an opportunity for Inkom to get its own library, Short said. 
In 2023, the library district received a $500,000 grant from the Idaho Commission for Libraries, through a federally funded grant program. In 2024, the community voted in favor of a special plant facilities reserve fund levy with just over 60% of the vote, East Idaho News reported. 
The levy is expected to generate just over $1 million over 10 years to finance the rest of the construction project. 
The district also used unexpended savings to cover costs and received some donations. The library itself is filled with many book donations, Short said. 
“The community support has been overwhelming,” she said. “So many questions everyday about when we’re opening, what’s going on, and what we’re going to have here.” 
The library, located at 321 Holstein St., is expected to have a limited opening in early January, with a grand opening in the spring.   
The new building will have printing services, 24-hour access to Wi-Fi in and just outside the building, a private telehealth or study room, a meeting room, and computers with accessible keyboards and a large screen, Short said. 
The printer and internet access seem to be particularly valuable to rural patrons, Short said.

 Community around Fernwood rallied in support of construction of new library 

The Fernwood Library of the Tri-Community Library also serves Santa and Emida, but librarians say they’ve had patrons travel from 40 miles away to visit, State Librarian Stephanie Bailey-White said at an August Idaho Commission for Libraries meeting.  
The library had been located in a building built in 1905. Like the Juliaetta library, it had small rooms and was inaccessible to many patrons. 
Many of the residents of the northern Idaho communities are at least 20 miles from medical services, so the Benewah County Free Library District wanted to prioritize a place for telehealth visits in a new location, Bailey-White said.
A library team was formed to start fundraising, and they garnered about $50,000 and around $240,000 worth of local in-kind contributions. 
 “They had tremendous community support,” Bailey-White said. 
In 2023, the state library commission awarded the district $500,000 for the new Fernwood branch. Ground broke in 2024 on the new building and the exterior was completed in June. 
The new library, located on Isaacson Street across the highway from the Fernwood Merc., was planned to open in the fall. 
The library director for the district could not be reached for comment. 
 Latah and South Bannock libraries say they’ve largely evaded challenges under Idaho’s ‘library’ law

Libraries had been the center of hot debate in the Idaho Legislature between 2022 and 2024, culminating in the passage of House Bill 710 in 2024. 
Idaho Legislature passes bill requiring Idaho libraries move ‘harmful materials’

The law allows children or their parents to file lawsuits against public or school libraries if they obtain materials deemed harmful to minors due to the presence of “sexual conduct.” 
Short and Hernandez said their districts had received no formal complaints since the law went into effect. 
Hernandez says sometimes people don’t like what they see on the shelves, but that these complaints are also usually met with explanations about why the materials are important to others in the community. 
The district’s policy includes a requirement that the patron read the entirety of the material they plan to complain about. 
“People don’t like some of this stuff, but there’s still people in their communities that relate to these diverse materials,” Hernandez said. 
Short also said she’s gotten complaints, but no formal requests to move books. When questions have been raised about materials in the library, they usually are resolved with a discussion, she said. 
“Fortunately, my whole district has been very supported by our community,” Short said. 
One conversation centered on the classic Mark Twain novel Huckleberry Finn and its inclusion of the n-word. She explained to the concerned patron the book’s importance in America’s literary history, and that the discomfort the reader felt was part of the point. 
“She understood why we had that book in our collection,” Short said, “and kind of became an advocate for the library after that.”

(Dan Forer | Getty Images)Wisconsin lawmakers are exploring ways to make it easier for school districts to consolidate as they face  declining enrollment and financial difficulties.
There are 421 school districts in the state of Wisconsin and about two-thirds are struggling with declining enrollment. According to preliminary numbers from the Department of Public Instruction, enrollment for public school districts in the 2025-26 school year fell by about 13,600 students, representing a nearly 2% decrease from last year’s estimate. Total enrollment across school districts is about 759,800 this year. 
Reps. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay), Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said during an Assembly Education Committee public hearing Tuesday that declining enrollment is to blame for the financial troubles that schools are facing.
“The districts that are going to referendum all the time. It’s almost always because of declining enrollment. It just gets more expensive per student to educate those kids as the districts become smaller,” Kitchens said. “We’re not telling districts this is what you have to do or what you should do. We’re telling them this is an option for you to consider.” 
Schools in Wisconsin have seen a drop of about 53,000 students over a decade, from the 2013-14 to 2022-23 school years. Kitchens pointed to estimates from the Wisconsin Department of Administration that the population in Wisconsin is projected to drop by 200,000 by 2050, noting it will be largely due to the state’s declining birth rate.
Wisconsin’s school funding system is based in part on per pupil numbers, meaning that if fewer students are enrolled schools receive decreased funding from the state, even if a district’s overall costs may not fall. 
Kitchens said that having 421 school districts is not going to be sustainable in the long term in Wisconsin and questioned whether there is another state that “on a per capita basis has that many” school districts. 
Kitchens said the issue shouldn’t be partisan. He noted that school consolidation is something that the 2019 Blue Ribbon Commission on Wisconsin school funding supported through its  recommendations.
“Many districts have used the referendum process to increase the property tax burden on the local residents to backfill the loss in state aid revenue,” Nedweski said. “Many others have seen them repeatedly fail as property taxpayers are unwilling to raise their taxes to increasingly fund empty schools.” She noted that a recent Marquette Law School Poll found that 57% of participants said they would vote against a referendum request. “There is no referendum that can be passed or law that can be signed to single-handedly reverse decades of birth rate declines to alleviate the stresses of declining enrollment in our schools. It’s clear that a more long-term solution is needed to address these demographic challenges because the status quo is not sustainable.” 
Wisconsin has had a record number of school districts go to referendum to help meet costs. But beyond declining enrollment, public school advocates say the burden on local taxpayers asked to fund their schools through referendum has grown mostly due to the fact that state investments in public schools have not kept pace with inflation for almost two decades. In the most recent state budget, Wisconsin lawmakers provided additional special education funding, but opted not to provide any increase in general aid, leaving increased costs to fall on property taxpayers.
State Superintendent Tom McCarthy noted during the hearing that Wisconsin is currently spending the least, proportionally, in state revenue that it has ever spent on schools under the current funding formula. He noted that about 32.1% of state general purpose revenue goes to state general aid to schools, and that percentage used to be around 35%. He also said the conversation about declining enrollment and costs had to include the acknowledgement that school districts’ revenue limits have been frozen at different points over the last decade, prohibiting school districts from raising more funds unless they go to referendum to ask voters.
Nedweski said the bills would be useful tools and incentives for districts facing decisions about whether to consolidate.
“Buildings do not educate kids, teachers do,” Nedweski said. “By finding efficiencies through voluntary consolidation, districts will be able to reduce overhead and direct resources to the classrooms so that our students can continue to receive a quality education, while taxpayers receive relief on their property tax bills.”
The package of bills would take a number of steps to encourage districts to explore consolidation, including providing financial incentives.
School districts already receive additional aid when they consolidate. For the first five years after consolidation, a consolidated school district gets $150 per pupil. In the sixth year, the aid drops to 50% of what the school district received in the fifth year and in the seventh year, the aid drops to 25% of the fifth year. 
AB 644 would increase that additional state aid to schools that consolidate in 2026, 2027 and 2028 to $2,000 per pupil in the first year. The last six years would be the same as under current law. 
Kitchens said that he thought most school districts would be able to decide within a year whether consolidation is something that they want to pursue. 
“I’m very open in the future to extending that deadline, but I think to get it passed, we need to put a sunset on it, so we’re doing three years,” Kitchens said. 
Dee Pattack, executive director of the Wisconsin School Administrators Alliance, noted that the inclusion of 2026 won’t really be useful for school districts since districts that want to consolidate have missed the opportunity to do so if they haven’t decided by now for next year. She also suggested that lawmakers look at spreading out  the additional aid more gradually, saying that dropping aid from $2,000 to $150 per student creates a cliff.
Kitchens said he would look at amending the timeline included in the bill. 
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) noted that decisions about consolidation can be emotional and personal for communities. 
“Public schools are the heart of our communities, oftentimes in rural communities, especially. They’re one of the largest employers. It’s where you have the most celebrations. There’s athletic events that are important to everyone in the communities and so this decision of consolidation is deeply complex. It’s personal for a lot of school districts,” Hong said. 
Hong, who is running in the Democratic primary for governor, questioned whether lawmakers had considered just leaving the decisions on consolidation up to local communities altogether, noting that Wisconsin law favors local control of schools. 
“That’s why it’s voluntary. That’s why we’re offering these tools. It is not mandatory. We know it’s going to be difficult,” Kitchens said, adding that Door County used to be full of one-room school houses until there was a consolidation in 1960. “When they consolidated that and formed Southern Door [County] School District, people were out there with pitchforks. It’s always going to be difficult, but we have to look at the future and what it’s going to be.” 
Kitchens noted that districts are not “clamoring” to consolidate and that the option exists as a last resort for most. 
“There are a few that are, and you’ll hear from at least one of them today that really have reached that point where they know it’s necessary,” Kitchens said. “We’re not hearing districts begging for this.” 
Joe Green, district administrator and director of special education for the Greenwood School District, and Chris Lindner, superintendent for the Loyal School District, testified about the rural school districts’ journey of consolidation, which their school boards are focused on getting done by July 1, 2028. They said it has been an emotional journey as people are attached to their schools and communities, but that it could be the best option for them. 
“It might be the thing that gets us over the hump to consolidation,” Green said of the new legislative proposal. “It might be the funding that our two districts need to put a good plan in front of our communities. It might allow us to do some small projects to make consolidation smoother. There may be small construction, or things that we need to do to retrofit buildings, if that’s the way that our facility studies go. There’s a million different scenarios out there on what consolidation can look like. But without that funding, I mean, honestly, with our two districts $150 bucks a kid is $100,000 — not gonna do much with that… it’s just not going to do much.”
Green said the districts already share bus service and that 50% of their co–curricular activities are shared. They said that the schools began sharing students and staff due to their difficulty finding adequate staff to deliver instruction in rural Clark County in central Wisconsin. 
Lindner said that consolidation could help open up more opportunities for students. “We do drama together. If we did not, we would have five to six students that would not be able to do drama because, you know, can’t do it with five or six kids,” he said. 
Lindner said consolidation could also help save money.
“Our taxpayers are paying a lot of money for our operating referendums,” he said. “We tell communities if we do not start working together more, then we will be losing.”
AB 645 would instruct DPI to provide grants of up to $25,000 to groups of two or more school district boards for the costs of a feasibility study for school district consolidation or whole grade sharing agreements. 
Another bill, AB 647, would have DPI provide four-year grants of up to $500 per pupil enrolled in a single grade to school districts that enter into a whole-grade sharing agreement, agreeing to educate students at one location. 
Felzkowski said that whole-grade sharing is a step before consolidation.
“It lets them test the waters if they ever want to move to full consolidation,” Felzkowski said, adding that middle and high schools may be able to provide more class offerings, including advanced coursework, to students with grade sharing.
AB 648 would help create new supplemental state aid for consolidated school districts to  address differences in school districts’ levies when they merge. The measure is meant to address concerns of higher property taxes for residents of low-levy districts when a consolidation takes place.
AB 649 provides the funding for the bills, including $2.7 million for grants to schools that enter whole-grade sharing agreements, $3 million to provide state aid to offset levy limit differences and $250,000 for feasibility studies. 
McCarthy of DPI noted at the hearing that there are already several legal and mechanical supports in place to encourage consolidation, and that even with those, the last major consolidation that took place was on July 1, 2018. Two K-8 districts merged to become the Holy Hill Area School District in Richfield. 
McCarthy of DPI said the slate of bills being proposed are “largely building from past efforts to support and to incentivize consolidation” and that the agency doesn’t view them as “a brand new door that’s being opened up” to solve problems.
The final bill in the package, AB 646, would study what changes should be made to Wisconsin’s school districts. Under it, DPI would hire a contractor to conduct a study of Wisconsin’s school districts that looks at current school district boundaries, potential school district consolidations, existing school district facilities, staffing levels and salary scales, the population of school-age children in each school district, and revenue limits and current overall spending. 
McCarthy said the agency is most excited about this final proposal.  He said it is similar to what Vermont has done and addresses some of the factors that are important to consider when consolidating. 
The study would culminate in recommendations for changes to school district boundaries, a survey on the conditions of school district facilities across the state, information on the current and 10-year projection of the population of school-age children in each district and recommendations for school district consolidations that promote efficiency, are geographically feasible and economically viable. 
“We probably owe it to our school partners to take a long look at what are the right geographical boundaries here,” McCarthy said. “As we’re thinking about how to manage this stuff, it might be a good moment in time to slow down and think about how do we sync some of these things up to be a more effective patchwork of schools that are serving our communities?”

As more tax cuts loom, disparate counties struggle with how to pay for elections, roads, weed control, fire trucks and even a morgue.
The post Wyoming’s property tax relief cuts deep for some, but not all  appeared first on WyoFile .","Park County’s real estate market caught fire amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as people from around the country flocked to this rural refuge. Buyers snapped up properties and sent the median sale price for a single-family home rocketing from $286,000 in 2020 to $415,000 in 2022.
As values soared, the average homeowner in this northwestern Wyoming county saw their tax bills jump over 60% in three years.
“Taxpayers tell me, ‘We don’t mind paying our fair share of property taxes,’” Park County Assessor Terry Call told the local Republican Party in January. “The problem for all of us taxpayers is the past few years haven’t been fair at all.”
State lawmakers heard homeowners’ concerns and responded with new and expanded tax breaks. This year, Wyoming’s property tax revenue shrank by about $250 million — with the Department of Revenue attributing roughly 80% of that drop, $198.5 million, to relief bills passed in 2024 and 2025. Funding collected for K-12 education dropped by $185 million, while special districts are receiving $12.7 million less than last year.
“Overall, people have been real appreciative of the exemptions.” Terry Call, Park County Assessor  
In Park County, the local school districts, county and city governments, community college, hospitals, fire departments, cemeteries and other special districts will collect about $61 million in property taxes this year. That’s down from the record $76.3 million assessed in 2023, though still up from the roughly $45 million billed in 2021.
Call has heard a handful of taxpayers express worries about how the recent reductions will impact schools and other government services, but, he said last month, “very few have said they’re not going to take the exemption because of their concerns.”
“Overall, people have been real appreciative of the exemptions,” Call said.
The state’s one-size-fits-all approach to property tax relief is playing out with notably different results, depending on the county and government entity. Some communities haven’t experienced much belt tightening, or they’ve found creative ways to collect replacement revenue. But others are eyeing cuts to everything from road maintenance to public safety to elections.

A few hundred miles to the south, in Carbon County, Sue Jones isn’t taking a property tax exemption that saved her $380 last year. As a county commissioner, Jones is witnessing the kind of cuts that resulted from putting that $380 back in her pocket. 
Ostensibly, the property tax cuts are designed to prevent Wyoming residents from having to pay more in annual costs, Jones said. But cutting property taxes has come at the expense of access to services like the library, museum and senior center in her county. 
Wyoming’s tax system, Jones said, “might need a little tweaking now and again, but you don’t just cut the legs out from under it. That’s pretty much what’s happened, and it’s a ripple effect.”
The outlier 
During a Joint Revenue Committee meeting in Gillette this spring, Campbell County Commissioner Scott Clem took the mic to critique the Legislature’s aggressive, and often confusing, approach to property taxes. Clem served in the state’s House of Representatives from 2015 to 2020. Now a county commissioner, he has serious misgivings about this year’s property tax cuts, even though his county has been insulated from the pain.

Much of Campbell County’s property tax haul comes from mineral property taxes, with coal, oil and gas production making up about 78% of the county’s roughly $4.8 billion in assessed valuation, or taxable value. 
Less reliant on residential property taxes than other counties, the Campbell County Commission passed a $145 million budget this fiscal year, nearly identical to last year’s. The Gillette City Council approved a $151 million budget, similar to the previous year. And the Campbell County School District passed a $323 million budget, a 4% increase that included the largest year-over-year jump in teacher pay in years. 
“We in Campbell County, in particular, we’re just an outlier because of our mineral wealth,” Clem said.
Campbell County has seen its assessed valuation — its taxable value of all properties that determines the value of a mill levy — drop over the last few years as coal production continues to decline. Since 2016, when hundreds of coal miners were laid off, local governments have reduced their workforce through attrition and built up reserves in case the economic bottom falls out. As long as coal is being mined, that will continue to keep property taxes lower for everybody in Campbell County, Clem said.
‘Hardship’ counties
Other counties aren’t so fortunate. 
Earlier this year, lawmakers considered, but ultimately rejected proposals to backfill local government budgets for eight so-called “hardship” counties. Big Horn, Crook, Goshen, Hot Springs, Niobrara, Platte, Washakie and Weston raise the lowest amount of revenue from property taxes among the state’s 23 counties. With no money from the state to make up for cuts, Big Horn County has responded to the drop in funds by imposing a hiring freeze.
“We’ll suffer the effects of this for years to come,” Big Horn County Commissioner Bruce Jolley said.
“At [some] point, you give up these services. You give up that road that we tried to keep nice for you.”Bruce Jolley, Big Horn County Commissioner 
Some of Big Horn County’s roughly 65 employees could be laid off in coming years to offset lost revenue. Although commissioners hope to avoid such job cuts, Jolley said, that could lead to further reductions in other areas, such as the county fair and emergency services.
The county commission also slashed its library budget from $350,000 the previous fiscal year to $280,000. In response, the library system cut employee benefits, trimmed operating hours and closed branches in Frannie and Deaver.  

Big Horn County Commissioner Bruce Jolley 
This year, Jolley doesn’t expect the county to be able to afford to crush gravel, and after an October rainstorm washed away some roads, the county’s gravel stockpile will shrink. Asphalt roads could also suffer, raising costs if maintenance is deferred to the point roads need to be replaced.
“I’m glad people are getting cuts on their property tax, I’m glad that people are getting a break,” Jolley said. “But, at [some] point, you give up these services. You give up that road that we tried to keep nice for you.”
Unfunded mandates? 
One hardship county, Goshen, now has less money to respond to new laws passed by the Legislature that require more labor. Following the raft of property tax relief measures, Goshen suffered a nearly $2.6 million drop in tax dollars collected for various local budgeting entities. 
In response, county departments were asked to cut budgets by 8.25%. For Assessor Debbi Surratt, that meant eliminating a position her office had been trying to fill. 
“It gets a little bit tough in counties like ours, where we have no minerals,” Surratt said. “We are pretty reliant just on our taxpayers to keep things going.” 
To avoid cutting staff in her department, County Clerk Mary Feagler looked to consolidate and transition from 11 polling places to three voting centers, saving her office around $30,000, or 20%, per election cycle. But community pushback prompted county commissioners to nix the idea and ask Feagler to try to cut staff before closing polling locations. Feagler, however, said she doesn’t have staff she could get rid of, especially with an election year approaching. 
These challenges are arriving just as the workload is increasing due to stricter election laws passed this year. The new statewide measures require voters to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship upon registration, adding more work for county clerks and election staff. The change requires more training for election judges, too. Judges must feel confident turning away voters, even their neighbors, if the voters fail to provide necessary ID, she said. 
Replacing precinct-by-precinct polling locations with vote centers would have both cut costs and increased her office’s ability to enforce the new rules, Feagler said. Secretary of State Chuck Gray said he “strongly opposed” the change in a September statement, and the county commission there ultimately voted to reject the proposal. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state, and it goes to local governments.”Gov. Mark Gordon
The true hardship from declining revenues, Surratt anticipates, will be felt over the next couple of years, when commissioners must make even tougher decisions about services. 
“The Legislature should do a better job of looking for other sources, not just putting a Band-Aid on it, and the [property tax] exemptions are just a Band-Aid,” Surratt said. “All they’ve done is muddied the water.”  Exemptions are often confusing for taxpayers to navigate, Surratt added.

Gov. Mark Gordon touched on the cascading impacts during an October town hall in Lander. 
“You’re hearing out of Casper that parks aren’t as neat as they used to be. You’re hearing out of Basin, we’re having to close libraries,” Gordon told the audience. “And these consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
What’s especially unfortunate, the governor said, is that many people misunderstood how property taxes are levied and allocated. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state,” he said, “and it goes to local governments. It’s how fire departments are funded, it’s how parks are funded, it’s how roads are funded, senior centers, all of that stuff is funded from local taxes.”
Gordon remembers that even a legislator on the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee appeared confused when he said: “The state doesn’t need that property tax.”  
About 72% of property taxes this year went to public education — both K-12 schools and community colleges — with the rest earmarked for county and city levies and special districts for services such as road and bridge work, sewer lines, firefighting, recreation, museums and libraries, according to a Department of Revenue report released this year.
Gordon worries that “by cutting ourselves so close to the bone,” the state is stripping away extra layers of protection that could insulate it if the economy sours. 
More room to cut

In more flush counties, where soaring property values pinched longtime homeowners, elected leaders would like deeper cuts. 
Powell City Councilman Troy Bray — who wants to see the elimination of all residential property taxes — believes the 25% exemption has helped local residents stay in their homes while causing little impact to governments.
The new exemptions and a 4% cap saved Powell taxpayers $101,500 this year. With an overall budget of around $25.6 million, Bray called the reduction an “almost inconsequential” percentage for the city.
In the 2026 election, Wyoming voters will decide on a ballot resolution to cut residential property taxes by 50% — which would be in addition to the 25% exemption already on the books, according to the Legislative Service Office. Bray believes a 50% exemption wouldn’t have a substantial impact on governments, either, contending there are always places to cut before touching necessary services like police and fire departments.
“I refer to them as the Chicken Littles of the world, you know, ‘The sky is falling.’ “Troy Bray, Powell City Council
Bray doesn’t heed the lobbyists and politicians talking about how “horrible” the effects of property tax relief efforts will be. 
“I refer to them as the Chicken Littles of the world, you know, ‘The sky is falling,’” Bray said. “Guess what? The sky didn’t fall.”
The impacts in Park County have been uneven, as some entities are much more dependent on property taxes than others.
The Park County government missed out on $2.18 million as a result of the tax relief, according to the assessor’s figures. County commissioners reduced their spending on roads and bridges and cut grants to outside agencies to help balance the $37.6 million budget.
At the Park County Weed and Pest District, the legislative relief reduced revenue by about $182,000 within a $2.38 million budget. That’s about a 7.5% hit.
Overall, the district plans to spend about $600,000 less than it did last year. Among other cuts, Weed and Pest Supervisor Josh Shorb said they slashed a seasonal weed-spraying crew from 12 to eight members, stopped spraying weeds along county roads and ended their support of a hazardous waste collection day.

The district also reduced incentives to landowners and farmers to spray for weeds and pests. For example, instead of covering half the cost of herbicides targeting Canada thistle and Russian knapweed, the district dropped its share to 30%. The district also ended a $2-per-acre subsidy that helped sugar beet growers battle the beet leafhopper and reduced a subsidy for fall field spraying from $10 to $7 per acre.
“We really pulled our horns in. Had to,” Shorb said.
The pullback is relative, as the district will still receive about $225,000 more in property taxes than it did in 2021, before Park County’s big surge in home values. 
Shorb said the tax bump allowed the district to expand its cost share programs, catch up on deferred building maintenance and replace aging vehicles and rental equipment. Another chunk was eaten up by inflation, he said, with wages, insurance, trucks and ATVs all rising in cost. In some cases, “it was like ‘dollar in, dollar out’ almost,” Shorb said.
He worries that further tax cuts will cause the district to miss invasive weeds like medusahead, ventenata or Palmer amaranth, or leave it unable to respond to an outbreak.
“I’ve been in this job for 25 years, and this has been the most stressful year by far,” Shorb said, noting additional cuts at the federal level. “All I think about is, ‘How am I going to pay for this? How are we going to do this? What are our priorities?’”
In Teton County, where soaring property values also filled county coffers, the current belt tightening has county commissioners hesitating on building a new morgue. When Dr. Brent Blue needs to move a body from the operating table to refrigerator storage at the Teton County morgue, he uses a jerry-rigged hospital lift fitted with zip ties and climbing webbing to hoist the body bag.
It’s one of many challenges the coroner faces because of the lackluster facility. A repurposed two-car garage previously used by Teton County Weed and Pest, the morgue didn’t have a drain until 2016. The coroner had to squeegee blood and tissue from autopsies out into the driveway.
“This place was literally toxic,” Blue said during a recent tour. “It still pretty much is.”
The coroner asked county commissioners for $270,000 to start designing and planning a new morgue, which will cost millions to build. Commissioners balked given budget challenges, but ultimately agreed to spend an initial $95,000 on the project. 
Overall, Teton County’s general fund lost $6 million in revenue from property tax exemptions in 2025. The county’s loss accounted for just 14% of the total $44 million in tax revenue, spread across a variety of tax collecting entities, exempted for Teton County residential property owners. The Elk Refuge Sewer District saw the smallest hit, losing $33, while public school education accounts combined took a nearly $34 million hit. Other large revenue losses included $2.3 million for the hospital, $767,150 for Teton County Weed and Pest and $205,437 for the fire district serving the Teton Village ski resort. 
Other counties, like Sheridan and Park, responded to reductions in revenue by imposing hiring freezes. Sheridan County also spent about $1.26 million from its cash reserves and slashed spending by up to 20% in each department to make up for an estimated $1.3 million in lost property tax revenue.
A mixed bag
In Cheyenne and Laramie County, business growth is helping stabilize budgets, but also straining public safety services typically funded by property taxes. 
This year, the city of Cheyenne annexed a business park, which completely offset a potential loss of $1.8 million in tax revenue. Laramie County has yet to make any major changes or staff cuts so far, as well.

However, the Laramie County Fire Authority is facing a roughly $500,000 reduction in its operating budget this year, down to about $1.77 million. The cut forced Fire Chief Jason Caughey to place all capital projects and equipment replacement on hold. The reduced budget must now strictly cover salaries and maintain the existing fleet and eight stations. 
Caughey warned that further cuts could reduce 365-day staffing at three stations to only one. 
As a special district, the firefighting service is funded solely through property taxes and receives no sales tax revenue. The district’s ability to levy taxes is restricted by a state statute written in 1947 that sets fire protection at three mills. (For each mill assessed, Wyomingites pay $9.50 for every $100,000 their property is worth.) Though this part of the statute has not been updated since, Caughey said fire apparatus costs have tripled since 2013, and Laramie County’s services have expanded to include things like emergency medical services. 
Since 2011, the fire district’s call volume has more than quadrupled, rising from approximately 450 calls in 2011 to a projected 1,950 calls this year, with 72% of current calls being for medical services.

At the same time, Cheyenne and Laramie County are leaning on new solar and wind farms and massive data centers to backfill lost revenue from property tax relief. But Caughey said his department lacks funding to support the specialized training required to handle emergencies at such facilities. 
“Those are very large facilities that have inherent risks associated with them,” he said. “Those weren’t there over the last 30, 40, 50 years.”
Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins described the impact of the tax cuts as an “opportunity loss” of $1.8 million that prevented the city from hiring essential personnel, including additional firefighters, police officers and street maintenance staff. As demand for city services grows, the city needs more money, not less, to fund those services, he said.
‘It adds up’
Carbon County is enormous — nearly 8,000 square miles encompassing everything from ranches near the Colorado state line to Saratoga’s outdoorsy attractions along the North Platte River to Rawlins on Interstate 80, some 150 miles west of Cheyenne.
In a county that large, there are a lot of services. So when Carbon County faced a property tax revenue drop of more than $900,000, Commissioner Jones said, she and other county commissioners had to make difficult cuts. 
Counties are statutorily mandated to fund services such as road maintenance and the operation of a county jail, which leaves certain items off the chopping block. But the commissioners and staff chipped away where they could. They reduced courthouse operating hours, left positions vacant and went without magnesium chloride treatment on roads for dust abatement. 
The commission also imposed major cuts on what it calls outside agencies, which includes services it’s not mandated to fund. That meant eliminating funding for economic development, slashing the library system budget by 53% and making painful cuts to senior services and the museum. 
Jones felt there was confusion about what property taxes actually fund. After seeing the impact firsthand, she’s opting to decline the tax exemption that saved her $380 — a small gesture to show that the services her tax dollars support are valuable, she said. 
“I also live in a fire district, in a school district, in a soil conservation district, in the weed and pest district,” she said. “I have family buried in the cemetery district. I have a local library. I have a local senior center. Seven things that my little $380, with everybody else’s, pays for.
“I think, for those seven things and my $380, I’m getting a really good deal.”
Constituents have asked Jones if they should also decline the exemption, she said, and her answer is that they have every right to claim it. 
“By all means, take it. It’s there,” she said. “But if you don’t, and you care about libraries and law enforcement, weed and pest districts, fire districts and even cemetery districts, it adds up.”

Dick Cheney's passing functions as a Rorschach test for our ability to embrace political nuance, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Cheney — or — What’s in a name? appeared first on WyoFile .","The mere mention of the Cheney name evokes powerful reactions from Wyomingites. It seems that nobody can discuss that name dispassionately.

Opinion

The Cheney name, instead, is laden with polarizing political overtones that issue from a part of the brain that cannot be objective, that fixates upon the bright shiny objects of our modern civil discourse. This, in my opinion, reflects poorly on ourselves as citizens, and says little about the Cheneys.
The recent passing of Dick Cheney re-animated this strange phenomenon. His critics came out of the woodwork to dance on his grave and vilify him with their voices on social media. Scant indeed were those willing to acknowledge Dick Cheney’s considerable contributions to the state and nation that he loved.
Marc Antony’s funeral oration in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” seems fitting to remember here. “The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.” We are too prone to focus on the negative rather than the good when we talk about the Cheneys.
I worked with Congressman Dick Cheney and his capable staff in the 80s, when I served in the Wyoming Governor’s Office. Cheney enjoyed universal respect for the way he represented Wyoming in Congress. His political acumen and his ability to “work across the aisle” with Democrats to get things done for the Cowboy State as our lone congressman were particularly valuable.
Back then, Wyoming was the envy of the nation for the effectiveness of our delegation — Cheney and Sens. Al Simpson and Malcolm Wallop. They left big bootprints on history. Cheney even wrote a book, “Kings of the Hill,” a historical blueprint for how Congress can work when guided by noble personalities and true statesmen.
I’m wondering aloud how a name that was once solid gold in Wyoming could, in such a short time, draw such bile from people he once represented so ably. For a state that prides itself on a long memory and sense of history, we have a very limited perspective when it comes to the Cheney name.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Don’t misunderstand, I hold the entire Bush the Younger administration, Vice President Cheney included, culpable for the disastrous Iraq War. That misadventure did a lot of damage. But it does not erase from my mind Cheney’s productive years as a fine legislator, nor does it diminish his contributions to Wyoming.
Those who posthumously vilify Dick Cheney suffer from a very selective myopia if they can’t acknowledge his stature in Wyoming politics. That says more about them than it does about him.
The same can be said about the political trajectory of another Cheney, Dick’s daughter Liz, who was elected to her father’s seat in Congress. Liz Cheney’s early terms in Congress were marked by her impressive legislative record and her almost meteoric rise to a leadership position in the House GOP.
I ran against Liz in the GOP primary in 2018, and my ass-whuppin’ at the polls gave me an object lesson in the potency and charisma of the Cheney name.
Liz Cheney’s future in Wyoming politics seemed limitless in those days. She was our fair-haired cowgirl, and folks in the Big Empty adored her. During Trump’s first term, Liz voted with the president over 90% of the time.
That changed in a heartbeat when Liz broke ranks with Trump and voted to impeach him for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Her vote, which in my opinion was an act of incredible political courage and patriotism, came at a high cost. Liz lost her seat in the next primary and became a pariah in the state that once revered her.
If Liz Cheney’s fall from grace proved anything, it proved that the Trump name is more important in Wyoming than the Cheney name. And I find that appalling.
For Trump’s name to replace the Cheney name at the apex of the Wyoming political pantheon says less about those names than it does about us as citizens.
And this turn of events calls to mind another Marc Antony quote from “Julius Caesar” when he says, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

The former Omaha union leader and registered nonpartisan said his second Senate bid in three years has taught him the system is “rigged.” 
“Trump was right, the system’s rigged … but it’s rigged by the big people and the people with the money that have the influence,” Osborn said. 
He means people like Ricketts, his likely opponent in the 2026 general election, a former two-term governor and the face of a prominent family of donors to conservative causes who steers the state’s dominant political operation. 
Osborn, who lost by six percentage points in 2024 to Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, has built a brand on his Navy veteran hat and flannel shirts, fed partly by hosting meet-and-greets in bars like this one across Nebraska. 
The Osborn campaign has held roughly two dozen such town halls over the past few months, reminding many of his campaign’s approach in 2024. Osborn prides himself on ‘old school politics,’ hearing from Nebraskans directly, where they live, and asking them what they want from Washington. 
“I would say the number one issue that people talk about first is the economy and the cost of everything right now,” Osborn said. 
He said he thinks his campaign should connect with people who’ve given up on politics, people who shrug their shoulders when a campaign ad comes on, who think the system wasn’t built for them and who might want better.
His closer-than-expected race against Fischer made Osborn a national political name, and his style of populism — focused on the working class, union organizing and kitchen table issues — has been talked about as a possible way out of the bipartisan screaming match that surrounds most political races. 
Republicans are taking him more seriously this time. The National Republican Senatorial Committee started its 2026 Nebraska race by running digital ads saying a social media account with ties to Osborn had liked gay porn and criticized him for his stance on the federal government shutdown. Osborn has argued Democrats were right to seek congressional leverage for extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits to keep health insurance premiums from sharply increasing.

Many in the public first learned of Osborn in 2021, when he lead an 11-week strike of Nebraska Kellogg’s workers as the company pushed for concessions in a new union contract despite the food company posting record profits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kellogg’s workers secured a five-year contract that gives wage increases, a path to eliminating a two-tiered wage system and enhanced benefits.
Osborn was later fired by Kellogg’s management for allegedly watching Netflix while on the job, a step he viewed as retaliation for leading the strike. In the years since, Kellogg’s has announced it would close the Omaha plant by 2026. Fischer’s team at the time blamed Osborn for the loss of local jobs. Union leaders defended Osborn’s work and said they were working to keep the plant open.
Ricketts’ campaign constantly calls Osborn a “fake independent” and repeatedly points to Osborn receiving donations and support from Democrats as examples of what they see as his ties to the state’s largest minority party. 
Opponents hammer him for using ActBlue, an online fundraising tool that promotes itself as a tool for helping elect Democrats. They also point to his tacit support from Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb, who has said Democrats want to break Republicans’ hold on Nebraska politics.
Osborn and his campaign manager, John Dolan, laugh off the critiques — describing it as “comical” that the best that the Ricketts team came up with is calling Osborn “fake.”

Osborn said he uses ActBlue because he couldn’t also get on the Republican-aligned fundraising tool WinRed. Osborn added that he viewed ActBlue like PayPal or GoFundMe, as little more than a platform for donating political money, and said he doesn’t take stock in the tool being “associated with Democrats.”
Dolan, at the bar, said team Ricketts can “read into it all they f— want,” while previews of the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles flashed on TV. 
Some nonpartisan candidates in other states who have followed Osborn’s 2024 approach are avoiding using ActBlue to sidestep being associated with the Democratic Party. The fundraising platform changed its rules this year to allow use by some Independent and nonpartisan candidates. 
Osborn said he could’ve done the same, but the “alternative would be to not raise the money we need to win.” 
“You have two choices, and you can’t have the other one,” Osborn said. 
On the campaign trail, Osborn sometimes confuses Democrats and Republicans because of the way he talks about President Donald Trump. Osborn has previously said he supported Trump’s stance on China, the border and “draining the swamp.” Like many labor leaders and former labor leaders, he holds mixed views on Trump’s tariffs, he told NBC News.
He has also criticized Trump for his tax and spending bill, aka the “big, beautiful bill,” which he said would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy “off the backs of people.” 
Trump’s major legislative victory remains unpopular with Americans. Osborn says he plans to campaign on what the law actually does, which he says hurts working people. He says it cements tax cuts from the first Trump administration that primarily benefit high earners, while giving some new temporary tax breaks to workers earning less.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos polling showed about 6 in 10 Americans blame Trump for the current rate of inflation, and more than 6 in 10 disapprove of how Trump is handling tariffs, the economy and managing the federal government. A poll from NBC News indicated that two-thirds of voters say Trump has not lived up to their expectations on the economy and cost of living.
The federal government has been experiencing the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which could soon end. Osborn told Fox News Host Jessica Tarlov on her podcast that he supported the shutdown. The Ricketts’ campaign, and the NRSC criticized Osborn’s backing of the shutdown as another example of him siding with Democrats. The NRSC called him “another Democrat lap dog.” 
While Osborn said he doesn’t know everything about the shutdown, he said he would have fought for the  insurance subsidies, the tax credits at the heart of Senate Democrats’ efforts to keep the government closed until they force at least a vote on extending them.  
He also told the Lincoln Journal Star last month that the shutdown was “in line with what I’ve been saying all along,” that “we’re in this two-party doom loop.”

Until recently, Republican congressional leadership had expressed little interest in negotiating on the health care subsidies during the shutdown. Osborn said he’s relieved the shutdown appears to be headed for an end, but he remains concerned about rising healthcare costs. 
Osborn said the role of the federal government is to protect its citizens, which should include access to “access to freaking hospitals when we’re sick, because there’s no Democrat or Republican in the back of an ambulance.”
On the campaign trail, Trump has promised “the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” after the Biden administration saw illegal border crossings spike at the end of 2023 but start decreasing in 2024.  
Osborn said he supports stronger border security. He ran an ad in the previous cycle offering to help Trump build his border wall. He said Trump has done a good job securing the border but he doesn’t like how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Trump have been making light of enforcement. 
ICE and other government agencies have used online memes to gain attention and rile up a part of the GOP base. Homeland Security, for instance, posted an AI-generated photo of a cornfield this year with ears wearing ICE hats and a caption of “Coming Soon: The Cornhusker Clink.” 
Trump posted “‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning” with an edited photo of himself depicted as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore from the Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now.
“Even if you think it’s funny, that is not professional coming from the White House,” Osborn said. 
Nebraska, like the rest of the country, has seen an increase in immigration detention activity, including an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha earlier this year. The state expects to begin receiving federal migrant detainees in the state’s new immigration detention facility in McCook earlier this month. 
Osborn said Trump — like most administrations before him — isn’t doing the comprehensive immigration reform that’s humane and that’s going to fix the problem “because it’s an economic issue.”
He has argued for months that the “big four meat packers” benefit from having a “wide open border with no immigration policy, because they can exploit the labor, enrich themselves, and then they donate millions of dollars to candidates so they won’t do anything about it.” Trump in recent days also attacked the meatpacking industry on social media, posts applauded by many in Nebraska’s all-GOP congressional delegation, including Fischer.
Democrats have talked about Osborn as potentially offering them a roadmap back to national power and relevance, based on his outreach to many of the working-class voters party surveys show it lost touch with. 
But he doesn’t think about how his campaign fits into the bigger picture of politics. He said he “just wakes up every day and goes to work.”
People around Osborn said they see the bigger picture. Dolan, his campaign manager, said voters are tired of “the same caricature of people getting elected into government and then doing nothing.” 
Osborn said he has heard from many who say “the only way we’re going to get anything done in the country is by electing independents.”
The Osborn campaign says it plans to spend a lot of time next year on college campuses as it tries to figure out the “puzzle” of voter turnout. Osborn’s team is focused on turnout because midterm elections often have lower turnout than in presidential election years, and Nebraska’s smaller population means smaller increases in turnout can have a significant impact in close races.
“​​Ricketts is going to be on your TV and your radio,” Osborn said. “I’m going to hopefully be in your living room, in your business, and having a beer and chatting it up.”
The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Andrew Kennard/Wisconsin Examiner)When a prison built in the 1800s is still housing people in 2025 with the same aging infrastructure, we have to be honest, the system is broken. Wisconsin’s prisons have been in crisis for years, and for the first time in a long time, we’re seeing a small but important step toward change. 
Gov. Tony Evers recently received bipartisan approval to overhaul Wisconsin’s aging prison system and close the outdated Green Bay and Waupun prisons. The overhaul strategy includes a $15 million project investment and outlines a four-year process to reduce the number of beds, modernize facilities, and shift the focus toward rehabilitation and safety. That’s progress, but 2029 is too far away, and Evers’ plan lacks the kind of decarceration measures needed to actually reduce the prison population and make Wisconsin safer. 
The reality inside our prisons doesn’t have four years to wait. People are dying. Staff are exhausted. Families are breaking under the weight of a system that punishes more than it prepares people to come home. Every delay costs lives and wastes taxpayer dollars that could be used to help people rebuild instead of being locked away. 
I know this firsthand because I lived it. I spent part of my incarceration inside Green Bay Correctional Facility, one of the oldest and most overcrowded prisons in Wisconsin. The facility was built in 1898 with a design capacity of about 17,000 people statewide, yet Wisconsin’s prison population has hovered above 22,000 for years. That means thousands of people crammed into cells meant for far fewer. Walking those halls, you can feel the age of the place, the air thick with humidity, the bitter cold in winter, and the lack of ventilation that makes it hard to breathe. The walls are cracking, the infrastructure is failing, and the environment itself strips people of their dignity. 
Those conditions don’t make anyone safer. They don’t prepare people for reentry. They create desperation, both for both the incarcerated and the staff working inside. The best way to ensure a safer Wisconsin is to get the people who are ready to reenter society out of our prisons and into reentry. Overcrowded and understaffed prisons overtax our correctional officers and make prisons unsafe for officers and incarcerated people. In addition, understaffing makes it harder to ensure that everyone gets the programming that they need. The Federal First Step Act and CARES Act Home Confinement have both proved that bringing the right people back early can result in lower recidivism, better public safety and safer and more effective prisons. 










If Wisconsin wants to lead on justice reform, this can’t just be a construction project. ... Real reform means giving people a path forward, not just warehousing. 


I was one of the many people affected by Wisconsin’s Truth in Sentencing law, which eliminated parole and early release. That law has kept countless people behind bars longer than necessary, removing the hope and incentive that parole once provided.
If Wisconsin wants to lead on justice reform, this can’t just be a construction project. Real reform means reducing the number of people behind bars, ending excessive revocations, expanding reentry programs, and investing in housing, treatment, and mental health care. It means giving people a path forward, not just warehousing. 
According to the Prison Policy Initiative, Wisconsin imprisons about 663 people per 100,000 residents, far more than Minnesota (173) or Illinois (341). Despite years of promises to reform, the state’s prison population has remained between 21,000 and 23,000 people for nearly two decades. 
Nearly 40% of new admissions each year come from revocations, not new crimes, meaning thousands are sent back to prison for breaking supervision rules like missing curfew, losing housing, or failing a drug test. That’s roughly 4,000 to 5,000 people every year, based on Department of Corrections data. I lead a statewide Smart Justice campaign focused on ending these excessive revocations, because it’s one of the biggest drivers of mass incarceration in Wisconsin. 
Add to that the worst racial disparity in the country. Black residents are imprisoned at 11 times the rate of white residents, according to the Sentencing Project, and it’s clear that our problem isn’t just old buildings. It’s old thinking. Reducing prison beds without changing these policies is like draining a bathtub while leaving the faucet running. Until we reform supervision, expand early release and invest in reentry and community support, the system will keep refilling itself. 
Closing prisons built in the 1800s is a step in the right direction, but it has to come with urgency and intention. We can’t keep reacting; we have to start transforming. The same energy that went into passing this plan must go into implementing it quickly and with input from the people most affected by it, those who have lived behind those walls, their families and the communities most affected by incarceration. 
As we head into a new election season, this issue must be front and center for every candidate running for governor. Wisconsin deserves leaders who will move us forward, not just talk about reform, but act on it. The next administration should be judged on whether it has the courage to close outdated prisons, expand second chances, and build a system rooted in rehabilitation, dignity, and justice. 
Gov. Evers was right when he said, “We’ve got to get this damned thing done.” But getting it done means more than moving money; it means moving with purpose. Justice reform isn’t about buildings; it’s about people. 
Wisconsin’s motto is Forward. It’s time for our justice system and our next governor to finally live up to that.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as a co-chair to promote natural gas as a route to long-term energy reliability as renewable energy sources are built out, the organization announced Tuesday.
The organization promotes moving away from coal burning plants and using natural gas to reliably support solar and wind power generation. Touted as advocates for an “all of the above” energy profile, the group is expanding their reach into the commonwealth to promote gas power alongside renewable energy in hopes to bring down utility bills while cutting emissions, despite the commonwealth’s plan to eventually eliminate fossil fuels.
“As a Virginian who knows the importance of natural gas to my Commonwealth’s economy, I believe that we must come together to secure a reliable and affordable energy future,”  McAuliffe said in a statement. 
McAuliffe will lead the organization with former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, former U.S. Reps. Kendrick Meek of Florida and Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. 
The group points to studies that suggest transitioning to 100% renewable energy will be cost prohibitive and meeting peak demand for energy will prove a challenge. Natural gas in conjunction with renewable sources will allow the demand to be met at a reasonable cost, the group has said. 
Reporting by the Guardian and Floodlight show that Natural Allies is backed by fossil fuel companies to appeal to young, liberal, non-White constituents. Their mission is to focus on how gas is “cleaner” than coal, yet fossil fuels remain a major driver in climate change.
Ryan said this strategy “can show Democrats they don’t have to choose between environmental progress and economic reality. We can lead on both fronts.” Environmental groups believe the messaging from the group is “greenwashing” the impacts of gas power on the climate.
Natural Allies states that they work with lawmakers to educate them on how they can marry gas power and renewable energy to meet their states’ needs. The group is largely focused on Virginia, New York, and New Jersey and stresses the significantly lower carbon emissions that natural gas emits compared to coal fired plants.
In Chesterfield, that is a common argument made in support of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a proposed gas peaking plant to be built on the site of a former coal plant. Hundreds of residents in the area have been fiercely opposing the plant and say they want to prevent additional pollutants being released into the surrounding communities.
Still, Natural Allies’ website reads that “Without natural gas, higher-emitting fuels like coal and oil would be needed to keep lights on. Additionally, rising energy costs will disproportionately impact vulnerable households — worsening health, education, and economic outcomes.”
McAuliffe served as Governor of Virginia from 2014-2018, before the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed in 2020 – which mandates utilities retire gas powered plants by 2050. Virginia is also one of the largest energy importers in the country and is facing a demand crisis with hundreds of power thirsty data centers on the grid and more expected.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security is asking for more than 100 state troopers, in part to fill in patrol gaps left open because of a law enforcement surge in Memphis.
Safety Commissioner Jeff Long made a request for $43.5 million to fund 139 positions for Highway Patrol officers, supervisors and support staff during budget hearings with Gov. Bill Lee. Nearly 120 of those would be state troopers.
The personnel increase would make up more than half of Long’s overall budget increase of $84.2 million, which includes $19.7 million for a department “market adjustment” to cover inflation.
The department has 300 troopers working in Shelby County, roughly 100 per shift, as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, a combination of local, state and federal forces, including the Tennessee National Guard, which is the subject of a lawsuit.
The buildup could last for a year, although Lee has said he believes it could continue in some form “forever.”
Tennessee has more than 1,000 highway patrol officers and shifted about 25% of them to the Memphis buildup from other parts of the state. Troopers are being rotated in and out of Memphis and some adjustments will be made, Long added, but other counties are left to fill in for those working in Shelby County. 
“They’re not on skeleton crews because we’re not emptying certain areas. We’re pulling from the different areas across the state, as we do any other major operation,” Long told the Lookout. “It leaves (open shifts) somewhat for the people who are still there. That’s why we need more troopers too.”
Lee has made increasing trooper strength a priority during his two terms in office. His budget for this year added officers for a fifth straight year, roughly 370, though the state has had trouble filling all of the positions.
Asked about moving a large number of troopers to Memphis, Lee said Monday when he took office the state had about 800 troopers and was told the department needed 1,300  to be fully staffed.
The state shifted more troopers to Memphis over the past few years because of continual complaints about speeding and drag racing on the city’s interstates. 
Lee said he would evaluate whether the troopers Long requested are needed, but he added that the investment in law enforcement was necessary.
“It’s working,” Lee said. “We’re surged in Shelby County.” 
The governor called Long’s request more of a move to continue improving trooper staffing to reach his initial goal than a reaction to the Memphis buildup.

Chief Jay Johnson is accused of having a pole camera, owned and operated by the police department, installed at his Racine County home in late 2024. A 15-page criminal complaint states that Johnson put up the camera for personal use while he was in the process of divorcing his wife. 
The complaint also states that Johnson’s alleged personal use of the camera  violated the wishes and advice of Greenfield’s mayor, city attorney and members of the police department. In July, special agents from the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ) Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) attended a meeting held at Greenfield City Hall to discuss a months-long investigation with city officials. 
According to the complaint, the special agents “were advised that during an internal investigation of Chief Johnson, which was conducted earlier in 2025, investigators uncovered actions they deemed as possibly criminal in nature. Outside agencies were later contacted to investigate potentially criminal violations committed by Chief Johnson.” 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Interviews with Greenfield’s human resources director, mayor, city attorney and police department staff turned up statements  that Johnson wanted to use a tax-payer funded, police department-owned pole camera at his home in Wind Lake because of  “safety concerns stemming from his divorce,” according to the complaint. Mayor Michael Neitzke said Johnson claimed to have been attempting to get a retraining order against his wife “in part because she was dating a felon,” the complaint states. Johnson claimed to have experienced harassment including a white rose being left in his driveway. The chief’s restraining order was denied, the complaint states, after which he asked the mayor about installing a pole camera. “Mayor Neitzke advised agents that he did not understand the type of camera Chief Johnson was talking about and believed it was equivalent to a trail camera or Verizon-type camera,” the complaint states. 
The mayor gave Johnson the go-ahead to install the camera, but later began to reconsider the decision. Neitzke contacted city attorney Christopher Geary, who said Johnson shouldn’t install the camera “citing legal issues with its use for personal reasons.” Geary then contacted Johnson stating that “his divorce is not related to his job,” the criminal complaint states. Johnson’s reaction was reputedly bombastic, “‘I think it’s f-ing ludicrous,’ was the exact quote,” Geary wrote in an email to the mayor. 
Johnson tried to argue that what he wanted was no different from the security former Gov. Scott Walker received during the Act 10 protests, and that a prior Greenfield police chief also had home security. “I tried to explain the difference is that the threats in those situations stemmed from the person’s public employment and/or public policy positions, whereas this is, as I understand it, an entirely personal situation,” Geary wrote in the same email, which is featured in the criminal complaint. “He didn’t appreciate the distinction.” 
The mayor said he thought that was where the issue ended, and that Johnson hadn’t installed the camera. In December 2024, however, Greenfield Police Department  Captain Chuck Fletcher was asked by Johnson about installing the pole cameras, according to the complaint. Fletcher told the DCI special agents that he had known Johnson his entire career and “considers him a close friend.” Fletcher stated that he also knew Johnson’s wife, and didn’t consider her to be an angry or violent person. Johnson allegedly told Fletcher that he wanted to keep the camera installation “low key” and discrete. Fletcher then assigned Detective Scott Simons to handle the installation, and told investigators that he did not know that the city attorney had advised against it. 
The complaint states that Fletcher communicated the chief’s desire to be “low key” and quick about things to Simons. The detective said he was asked to “change the password for logging onto the camera, as all pole cameras have a general username and password,” according to the complaint. “The camera that was to be installed at the Defendant’s residence would have a unique username and password.” Although Greenfield’s pole cameras are owned and monitored by the police department, they are installed by We Energies technicians. A camera was taken down “from a closed drug investigation,” according to the complaint. Simons told another detective that it was “being installed in another county for another investigation.” The camera was eventually installed across the street from the chief’s home. 
Some time later, Greenfield Police Association president and detective Aaron Busche “found out by accident” about the chief’s personal camera. Busche keeps track of the department’s four pole cameras, which are listed on a whiteboard by number and location. Busche realized that the camera at Johnson’s home had no documented location. “Detective Busche was told by Detective Scott Simons that the camera was loaned to an outside agency for their investigation,” the complaint states. “Detective Busche was not told what agency the camera was loaned to.”
 
Criminal Complaint_1 - Johnson, Jay A_ 2025CF005150_ Johnson, Jay A._28099053_1
 
In the spring of 2025, Busche heard that there was video feed from the mystery camera, but then realized he couldn’t log in because the password had been changed. Busche then used a “backdoor process” to access the camera feed, and realized it was the chief’s home. During a meeting with acting chief Eric Lindstrom, Simons was asked to take the camera down. 
Johnson is accused of violating Greenfield PD’s standards of conduct by using department equipment for personal gain, and omitting or even falsifying information given to staff who carried out the camera’s installation. The criminal complaint also accuses Johnson of threatening behavior towards law enforcement. In late August, it states, a person attempting to disguise their voice called the police department saying, “Hello you f-ing pigs, revenge is sweet!” The dispatcher and Busche both recognized the voice as Johnson’s. 
Acting Chief Lindstrom had also filed a complaint against Johnson with the Oak Creek Police Department, accusing Johnson of threats and harassment over Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. One email copy says: “He’s on board, hold on tight!!!! Idiot and the ice princess will pay dearly. JJ DOJ is the man! Boom. God is good.” Another message says: “KL is on board. Friday meet with us. Ughhh. So unnecessary but he’s all in for me rn. HR and MN GOING DOWN!!!! EL is dirty so stay tuned. TY owe you!!!!” The criminal complaint states that “EL” is a reference to Eric Lindstrom who, like Busche, has also served on the Milwaukee-area team which investigates civilian deaths by police. 
The controversy raises questions about oversight of police surveillance technology, accountability for officers, and how problematic police officers climb the ranks. Community members in Milwaukee County have pushed for Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) local ordinances, which would provide more oversight and control of police surveillance tools.
Fox6 reported that a string of disciplinary issues going back to 2013 followed Chief Johnson. The news outlet obtained documents which described Johnson, who was a captain at the time, as having issues with “failing to own decisions and initiatives by administrative staff” or “engaging in inappropriate conversations with officers.” Johnson had been accused of sharing management-level discussions or information related to subordinates, and planning a “booze cruise” and other organized parties. 
A 2015 memo stated that “he can’t be allowed to supervise,” and in 2017 he signed a settlement to become Greenfield’s emergency management coordinator with the fire department, before becoming chief. Asked by Fox6 how Johnson became chief, Mayor Neitske redirected blame to the city’s Police and Fire Commission.

Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, criticizes Republicans for failing to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits in a stopgap funding measure on Nov. 10, 2025 on the Senate floor. (Screenshot from Youtube)After the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill that does not include extended Affordable Care Act tax credits, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is not confident that a future floor vote in the Senate will lead to an extension.
“I don’t have confidence about how that vote is going to turn out,” Bennet said in a press call Tuesday. “I don’t expect any Republicans in the Senate to change their vote, and I don’t expect the House to try to pass that bill. We could end up being surprised by that, but I wouldn’t hold out hope for that.”
The U.S. Senate voted 60-40 Monday on a stopgap spending bill that will reopen and fund the federal government through Jan. 30 following the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Members of the House of Representatives began traveling back to Washington, D.C. this week, as the chamber will need to pass the Senate-approved measure before the government will reopen.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance the spending bill, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits to support Americans who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace.
The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.
Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said. He said he thinks the Democrats who voted to pass the stopgap measure made a judgement that the downsides of continuing the shutdown overrode the benefits.
“I obviously didn’t share that judgment, but that was their judgment,” Bennet said. 
While he is “deeply disappointed” with the outcome in the Senate, Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, said he will continue to push for an extension of the tax credits as well as broader reform of the country’s health care system. He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S. 
The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said. But he said there is no plan B to help Coloradans facing higher insurance premium costs. 
“For months, we urged President (Donald) Trump and Republicans to come to the table and extend the tax credits — which are already existing law and simply need to be extended — to give families a little bit breathing room, to make healthcare a little bit more affordable, and they’ve refused,” Bennet said. 
Bennet declined to say if he still supports Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has faced calls from progressive groups and some Democratic House members to step down from leadership after failing to hold his caucus together in the shutdown fight.
Americans will make the judgement that Democrats continue to fight for affordable healthcare while Republicans make it more expensive, Bennet said, as Republicans have fought against the Affordable Care Act since it was first introduced. 
“We now know that we will never have an improved health care system as long as Donald Trump is our president and we have a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate,” Bennet said.
Many major federal government operations have been shut down since Oct. 1. The Trump administration laid off many federal workers during the shutdown, a move that will be reversed under the Senate-approved measure. Bennet said his office will work to reach out and make sure workers who were laid off in Colorado know that they could be reinstated.

Founded in 2004 by brothers Charles and David Koch, Americans for Prosperity, or AFP, describes itself as a grassroots advocacy organization that supports pro-growth policies, free markets, limited government, freedom and individual liberty. 
With the opening of its local chapter, Idaho became the 37th state with a brick-and-mortar state chapter, Americans for Prosperity announced in a press release. 
Jason Lehosit, who has three decades of campaign and policy experience in the Northwest, is serving as the Idaho state director of Americans for Prosperity.
Prior to taking on his new role, Lehosit most recently worked as the policy director for Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane.

“I’m excited to lead AFP-Idaho and support Idahoans getting engaged in grassroots efforts to magnify common sense and free market values across the state,” Lehosit said in a written statement. “Idaho’s on a great path, but we can’t take that for granted. We need to keep cutting red tape, reining in wasteful spending and protecting the values that make Idaho such a great place to live, work and raise a family.”
Although the Idaho chapter is new, Americans for Prosperity has held events and done work in Idaho previously. 
In August, Americans for Prosperity held a private breakfast event in Boise with U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, to promote the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer. Gov. Brad Little, Idaho House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield and Boise City Councilmember Luci Willits attended the Americans for Prosperity breakfast, while about 30 protestors gathered outside the breakfast, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. The protest was organized by the Idaho 50501 movement and Idaho Women in Action, with protestors calling instead for Idaho’s members of Congress to participate in open, public town hall events, the Sun reported.  
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, Lehosit said he hopes to have an office set up and running before the end of this year. 
The 2026 legislative session kicks off Jan. 12 at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

Robert Harshbarger pleaded guilty in 2013 to distributing an unapproved dialysis drug in Kansas. Harshbarger, a pharmacist at the time, bought the cheaper drug from China and sold it as if it were a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
He was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $848,504, a $25,000 criminal fine and forfeited $425,000 in cash.
“My husband paid his debt both personally and financially to society,” Diana Harshbarger told Johnson City television station WHJL. “We are thrilled and grateful that the President looked kindly upon Bob’s application.”
Trump’s pardon of Harshbarger came the same day as his pardons of former state House Speaker Glen Casada and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren. 
Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up the secret company that tapped into the state’s constituent mail services program. Casada and former state Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and worked with prosecutors, steered lawmakers’ business to a company secretly run by Cothren under a fake name. 
In late September, Casada was sentenced to three years in prison, and Cothren to 30 months. Smith has not received a pardon and was sentenced to eight months for her role in the scheme. She is seeking a presidential pardon, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
Trump has been known for using his pardon power to benefit his allies. In October, he pardoned Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao’s company helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of a cryptocurrency in the company that Trump’s sons own and operate.
Trump then told CBS News 60 Minutes that he had no idea who Zhao was, and only pardoned him because he was convicted as part of a “Biden witch hunt.”
Diana Harshbarger has received Trump’s endorsement in all three of her congressional elections. The president also endorsed Bobby Harshbarger, the couple’s son, in his 2024 race for a state Senate seat he won. 
Diana Harshbarger is also a pharmacist and was a corporate officer at American Inhalation Medication Specialists, where her husband sold the misbranded drugs.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.
Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding, and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.
“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.
Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A United Nations report last week found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.
“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.
“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.
The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, starting on November 10. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.
“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.
Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.
Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.
“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 2.3 F of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 5.4 F by the end of the century.
“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”
There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones —  highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.
Citizen-led pollution monitoring persists in Louisiana, despite law that limits its use

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education and advocacy nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.
Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.
“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., listens during his event at the Washington County Fairgrounds. Oct. 19, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)ARLINGTON, Neb. — The attendees of an October steak fry at the Washington County Fairgrounds hint at the history and reach of Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts’ political operation.
The list last month included Gov. Jim Pillen, most of the state’s congressional delegation minus U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, Oklahoma U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin and about 100 GOP supporters. 
Speakers emphasized Ricketts’ impact on the state and why they think his reelection is vital for conservatives in the state, highlighting his time as governor and his help in passing President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
“If you like the way this game is played in Nebraska, where we have a majority of Republicans at the table,” U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told the crowd, “We need you there for Pete Ricketts.”
Ricketts is a force in state politics. His endorsements and opposition carry weight, having helped elect a governor and flip legislative seats. He has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics and has a political team behind him that is known for its no-holds-barred approach to campaigning.

“Conservative leadership matters,” Ricketts told the crowd. “Conservative leadership delivers.”
In two terms as governor, Ricketts reshaped the Legislature and state law. He pressed for passage of tax and spending cuts, managed the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on improving the efficiency of state agencies, efforts he has since tried bringing to Washington, D.C., and the federal government. 
Ricketts helped fund a successful ballot measure banning abortions after the first trimester, amending the state constitution in 2024. His family financed efforts to restore the death penalty through a successful 2016 ballot initiative after the Legislature repealed capital punishment and overrode his veto as governor. 
In Congress, Ricketts has wasted no time building relationships and using his financial connections to rise into the role of vice chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He serves on several Senate committees, including the Budget Committee.
And he has sponsored bills that would establish guardrails for stablecoins — essentially a regulatory framework for some cryptocurrencies — and another to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion without parental consent. He also introduced bills to eliminate federal taxes on Social Security and military retirement benefits.

Ricketts first ran for the Senate against U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., in 2006. He lost what was then the most expensive race in state history. In 2023, Gov Jim Pillen appointed Ricketts, whom Ricketts had supported, to replace former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., after Sasse had resigned to lead the University of Florida.
Ricketts last November easily won a special election to finish the final two years of Sasse’s term over Omaha Democrat Preston Love Jr. 
Now, Ricketts is looking to win his first full six-year term but faces a different challenger than in past races — a populist. Former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, has challenged Ricketts for his Senate seat, setting up a race that will be watched nationwide.
President Donald Trump’s brand of populism is a driving force in modern politics. Osborn has tried to build a new labor-based populism, one grounded in working-class needs and contrasting with the wealthy.  
Ricketts argues his tilt with Osborn is not a broader ideological fight. He says it’s just another race. 
“We’re just going to run a campaign like we always do … I’ve been in elected service for over 10 years … I’ve got a track record of delivering for Nebraska,” Ricketts told the Examiner at The Door Sports Bar & Grill in Fremont after his Sunday steak fry. He drank a soda, saying he doesn’t drink on Sundays.  
Ricketts has dealt with offshoots of Trump populism for years. The Nebraska Republican Party’s leadership team loyal to him was ousted in 2022 in favor of one more faithful to Trump. Ricketts tussled with Trump in a 2022 proxy war for governor as Ricketts backed Pillen and Trump backed multistate agribusinessman and Trump donor Charles Herbster.
The Ricketts family, who are major donors to conservative causes, have a complicated relationship with Trump. They opposed Trump in the 2016 GOP primary. In 2024, Marlene, his mother, donated to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican primary. His father, Joe, donated to Trump after the 2024 primary. But Pete Ricketts has said he supports the Trump agenda of lower taxes and less regulation, and his brother raised money for the national GOP.
This year, Ricketts said he’s going to contrast his conservative record of results against what Osborn “says he is and what he actually stands for.”  He and his team have relentlessly tried making the case that Osborn is secretly a Democrat, describing his nonpartisan approach as “fake.” 
Ricketts said “people are smart” and “can see through” Osborn. Osborn is a former Omaha labor leader whose state voter registration records show has been a registered nonpartisan for more than a decade.
Osborn lost to U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer in 2024 by six percentage points. His closer-than-expected race against Fischer has made Osborn a national political name, and a race that Ricketts acknowledged will be “tough.” 
Osborn and his campaign have tried  making the case that Ricketts and the billionaire class now run the country, alluding to the wealth of the senator’s family that created the company that became TD Ameritrade and owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs. Ricketts’ financial disclosure forms list him as a millionaire.

Ricketts said one of the top issues in the race will be inflation, adding that former President Joe Biden’s “failed policies” are to blame, but that Trump is working with Senate and House Republicans to lower energy prices. He pointed out that gas prices are lower now than during the Biden presidency. Ricketts also is banking on getting rewarded by voters for the tax cuts in Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
It makes tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for higher earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less. Ricketts said he could talk about the “fantastic bill” for an hour, “because there’s so much in it that is really good.” 
He pointed to the provisions of the bill, including no tax on overtime and tips and the increase in the child tax credit, as examples of how Republicans who passed the law are helping working families. 
“They’ll see that and the next year, when they start filling out their taxes. They’ll start getting bigger refunds …they’ll see the impact,” Ricketts said. 
State and national Republican strategists have acknowledged the poor polling of Trump’s new tax law but said focusing on specific provisions, such as new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, could help improve public perception of it. 
Osborn recently attacked Ricketts for his long opposition to medical and recreational marijuana. Currently, the state is slowrolling two voter-approved laws legalizing and regulating medical cannabis.
Ricketts said his position on marijuana has “always been very clear.” He made national headlines in 2021 by saying, “If you legalize marijuana, you’re gonna kill your kids. He has argued that approving cannabis for medical use is a step toward legalizing recreational use.  
Trump has been more permissive about cannabis, including saying during the 2024 campaign that he would like to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III, which would loosen federal regulations around it.  
Ricketts voted this week — along with seven Senate Democrats and one independent — to reopen the government after the most extended federal shutdown in U.S. history.  Ricketts said the Democrats played politics and had harmed everyday people. 
Democrats sought to extend the enhanced tax credits set to expire by year’s end for individuals who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Ricketts told the Examiner that Democrats are holding the government up for “pandemic-era subsidies,” and Republicans are willing to talk about it after the government reopens. He didn’t answer a direct question of whether he would support or oppose efforts to extend the tax credits.
Ricketts said he would earn the votes of Nebraskans like he has before. 
“I think that’s what this race is going to be about [is] how we’re actually delivering for the American people and how Democrats failed … Osborn is a Democrat, and he wants their failed policies,” Ricketts said. 
The U.S. Senate general election is Nov. 3.

Roger Wicker to help an indigenous group in his state gain federal recognition as a tribe.
Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told a reporter from NOTUS that his block on four Mississippi nominees is due to negotiations with Wicker, Mississippi’s senior senator, over federal recognition of the Lumbee and other issues unrelated to the nominees themselves. Wicker serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has enormous sway over the legislation in which the Lumbee tribe would be recognized.
“Roger’s one of my favorite people here, and, you know, it’s just a matter of using the leverage people use every day here,” Tillis said. 
Wicker’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Lumbee is a group of indigenous people in North Carolina that has been seeking federal recognition as a tribe for over a century. But other federally recognized tribes have opposed the effort. 
Tillis has been a vocal supporter of federal recognition for the Lumbee. He is not running for reelection in 2026, so next year will be his final opportunity to secure a bipartisan bill for the indigenous people. 
President Donald Trump has also supported federal recognition for the Lumbee. 
Most of North Carolina’s congressional delegation supports federal recognition of the Lumbee. Language granting them federal recognition was added to the House version of the Pentagon’s annual spending blueprint. 
But language about the Lumbee was not included in the Senate’s version of the blueprint. 
Tillis also said he is negotiating with Wicker over other issues, but he declined to say what the issues were.  
In August, Trump nominated Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, both justices on the Mississippi Supreme Court, to vacant federal judgeships in northern Mississippi. Trump in July nominated Scott Leary and Baxter Kruger, his choices for U.S. attorney for the Northern and Southern districts of Mississippi, respectively.

(Photo by Kevin Wurm for ProPublica)It’s never been easy to qualify for Social Security disability benefits. Christopher Tincher knows this firsthand.
Tincher began his working life in a coal mine in Aflex, Kentucky, as a teenager in the 1980s. As mines across the region shuttered, he turned to scraping grills at a Hardee’s, then cleaning office buildings at night, then stocking shelves and changing tires at a Walmart in Arkansas. Later, he was hired by a nearby town’s wastewater department. Often, he had to wade into sewage to fix equipment and clean out feces, needles and tampons entering the treatment facility.
In 2017, some of that liquid got into his work boots, which didn’t fit properly and had caused blisters to form. It soaked into his flesh, infecting his right foot all the way to the bone. Doctors cut his leg off below the knee so the infection wouldn’t spread.
Tincher was now a manual laborer on one leg, but he was denied disability benefits by the Social Security Administration the following year. On average, 65% of applicants are rejected, though some successfully appeal.
In Tincher’s case, it was partly because he was 48, and the agency’s rules give priority to disabled workers in their 50s, who are officially deemed to be nearing advanced age and therefore less able to switch careers or develop new skills.
Tincher got a prosthetic leg and went back to work, this time for a medical supplies delivery company. He did this for seven years, frequently in pain, he said. His other leg was almost always in a cast, due to further infected blisters and diabetic nerve damage, and his eyesight was rapidly deteriorating.
This February, he applied for disability again. He was desperate; he was in a wheelchair, and he’d had to move in with his son’s family in Cabot, Arkansas, because he couldn’t pay the rent on his trailer. And there just weren’t other, less physically demanding jobs available locally for someone with his experience: “About the best job I could’ve got would’ve been a door greeter at Walmart, but I don’t think they have those anymore,” he said.
Tincher is now 55, and reaching that age marker helped him qualify, in June, for just over $1,500 a month in Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. A three-time Donald Trump voter, he was approved just in the nick of time.
That’s because the Trump administration is rewriting the disability eligibility rules, ostensibly to modernize the program, in ways that will make it even harder for aging blue-collar workers like Tincher to get benefits. Hundreds of thousands just like him would become ineligible for aid.
These changes would fall disproportionately on some of Trump’s most loyal supporters in red states. Most affected would be 50- to 60-year-olds without a high school or college education who have, for decades, toiled in physically grueling jobs, including coal mining, logging, and factory and construction work. The five states where the highest proportions of people rely on these benefits are West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabama. Unlike New York, California and a few others, these states do not have their own disability insurance programs for workers to turn to amid federal cuts.

“The Trump administration does not think that simply being 50 years old is a disability,” said a senior administration official who would speak only on condition of anonymity. In the 1970s, when the current rules were written, the official said, many more jobs involved manual labor, but in the internet age that isn’t true anymore. Workers in their 50s with physical injuries are thus receiving disability benefits “when they don’t need to be,” given that they could get a more sedentary job in the modern economy.
The administration has also justified cuts like these on fiscal grounds: The federal budget deficit is massive, the Social Security retirement system could become insolvent in less than a decade and savings need to be found.
But the disability program is paid for, via payroll taxes, by its own trust fund, separate from the one for the retirement program. So reductions in disability payments would not help the retirement system stay afloat. Indeed, cutting eligibility for disability could result in more disabled workers claiming retirement benefits early, actuarial experts note, which would only increase pressure on the retirement system. Meanwhile, the money in the disability fund, which is projected to remain solvent through at least the end of this century, would just sit there, unused.
The Trump administration’s upcoming proposed regulation would make two hugely consequential changes to the Social Security Administration’s disability system, according to four SSA officials with knowledge of the plans. First, it would modernize the job listings that Social Security’s disability adjudicators and judges use to decide if there’s work available in the U.S. economy that a manual laborer could do despite physical impairments — like a low-skilled desk job at a computer or driving for Uber or DoorDash. Second, the new rule would almost entirely remove age as a criterion, in most instances making a 50-plus-year-old like Tincher no more eligible for assistance than a 20-something.
Under the current system, eligibility for benefits ticks up at ages 50, 55 and 60, as workers become more medically vulnerable and less adaptable. Disability adjudicators use a series of grids that consider an applicant’s age, work experience and education level to determine whether they may have the skills to do another, less strenuous job. (The adjudicators make a yes-or-no decision on eligibility; each person who qualifies then receives a set amount based on their lifetime earnings. Once the person starts receiving Social Security retirement benefits, they no longer receive disability payments.)
The regulation that would undo this framework is slated to be formally proposed by December, according to a federal bulletin, although that deadline could push into next year, multiple officials said. The draft, which is based in large part on a plan that the first Trump administration tried to enact in 2020 before running out of time, still needs to be reviewed and edited by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. After that, it will undergo the standard process of allowing the public to submit comments and objections.
But in its current form, the regulation would slash at least 830,000 people’s eligibility for disability benefits, according to an initial estimate from the Urban Institute, an economic policy think tank. As many as 1.5 million could lose eligibility over the next decade, including the widows and children of workers. Disability attorneys and experts familiar with who most relies on the program contend that the numbers could be considerably higher.
Separately, the Trump administration is preparing a proposed regulation that would eliminate or sharply cut the Supplemental Security Income benefits of roughly 400,000 extremely poor and disabled people. This second regulation would reduce support for adults and children with severe disabilities who are living in low-income households, as well as elderly people living with their adult children on tight budgets.
Barton Mackey, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, confirmed in a series of emailed statements that the Trump administration is working on what he called “improvements to the disability adjudication process.” These changes would ensure that the disability system “remains current” and can be more efficiently administered, Mackey said, while also promoting “dignity in work.” (Mackey did not respond to a question about the change to the SSI program.)
Further “speculation on any proposed rule prior to it being published,” he said, “only serves to misguide public discourse and stoke fear in those who rely on disability benefits for economic stability.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai, in response to detailed questions, said that “President Trump will always protect and defend Social Security for American citizens” and pointed to Trump’s recent remarks commemorating the 90th anniversary of Social Security.
Retirement benefits — the largest and most popular of Social Security’s programs — would not be cut under the new regulation. But union leaders and advocates for older Americans said that the likely changes to disability eligibility for aging workers would undermine the financial and retirement security of working-class people and their families. Those who are denied benefits in their 50s would be forced to draw down any savings they have, which could lead them to apply for Social Security’s retirement benefits at age 62 instead of 67. That, in turn, would diminish their and their spouses’ monthly benefit amount by up to 30% until the day they die. Losing eligibility for disability would also block these workers’ access to Medicare, which they’re currently eligible for at their age precisely because they’re disabled.
Disability benefits frequently save recipients from bankruptcy, foreclosure and homelessness, according to research by University of Chicago economists and others.

George Piemonte, a former president of the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives, has spent 30 years working on disability cases across the South. He emphasized that that’s where these disability cuts would be most acutely felt. “They call it modernizing the program, but that’s political speak,” Piemonte said. “This is a matter of life and death. If these workers don’t get their benefits, some of them are not even going to live to retirement.”
Social Security officials under both Republican and Democratic administrations have long agreed that the disability program needs to be modernized in some practical ways.
For example, disability adjudicators continue to use a Dictionary of Occupational Titles, created in the 1930s and last updated in 1991, to determine whether there are jobs that exist in “significant” numbers in the national economy that an applicant with declining “residual functional capacity” could still do. The DOT, as it is called, is almost comically outdated: It includes “pneumatic tube operator” but not web designer. (Reporting by The Washington Post has helped bring attention to these issues in recent years.)
Under President Barack Obama, the Social Security Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics undertook a yearslong effort to replace the DOT with what would be called the Occupational Requirements Survey, an updated catalog of modern occupations as well as the levels of physical exertion and cognitive difficulty that each job can entail. Field economists surveyed employers across the country, asking how often their employees typically had to climb stairs or lift items of various weights and so on. That detailed dataset now exists, but it isn’t widely used yet; the new regulation would require its implementation.
“So, the technical part of all this has sort of already been accomplished,” said David Weaver, a former top Social Security Administration official who helped to develop the survey, known as the ORS, during the Obama years. (Weaver is now a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina.)
“But,” he added, “conservative economist types want to also make it harder for certain workers to get disability benefits, which would be a policy choice.” The complexity of the potential changes — the draft of the Trump regulation is hundreds of pages long and has been called the “mega reg” by insiders — has helped to mask this, Weaver and others said.
The new rule would almost entirely remove age as a criterion, in most instances making a 50-plus-year-old like Tincher no more eligible for assistance than a 20-something. (Kevin Wurm for ProPublica)
“Simplifying and Modernizing the Disability Adjudication Process” is how Mark Warshawsky headlined his written remarks when he testified in 2023 before a congressional subcommittee examining the issue. Warshawsky, an architect of the disability overhaul during the first Trump administration as the deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy at the Social Security Administration, testified that the current system wrongly “presumes a workforce with low levels of education which is largely involved in physical labor, works long hours, has little flexibility in work schedules, low adaptability, little access to assistive technology, never works from home, and retires early fairly often.” He also said that increasing eligibility starting at age 50 is not very scientific; for starters, it’s unfair to 49-year-olds. (Warshawsky, who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, declined an interview request from ProPublica.)
Warshawsky was unable to get the disability regulation across the finish line before Trump lost the 2020 election. But Russell Vought, the powerful head of Trump’s Office of Management and Budget and one of the originators of Project 2025, picked up on this first-term agenda item and has pursued it again this year.
The disability restructuring was “Russ Vought’s No. 1 priority for the Social Security Administration from Day 1,” said Leland Dudek, who was acting commissioner of the agency from February to May. In February, Dudek said, his staff met with Vought’s staff on multiple occasions; together, they “dug up what was done four years ago,” he said, indicating that the new proposed rule will be similar to a 2020 draft that was leaked to the press. (The senior Trump administration official said that Dudek is “disgruntled” and that the disability changes are no more of a priority for Vought than the rest of the administration’s “deregulatory agenda.” In the past, Vought has publicly pressed for fewer veterans and others to receive disability benefits.)
To opponents of the forthcoming regulation, including many still inside the Social Security Administration, Warshawsky and Vought’s conception of the modern economy neglects the fact that workers like Tincher grew up in a different world. They started their working lives at a time when most people didn’t have personal computers, when it wasn’t as common to get a high school education and when physical labor offered a path to eventual retirement security. To switch the rules now pulls the rug out from under them just as they’re reaching their most vulnerable years, officials and experts said.
“I believe disconnects occur when more highly educated policy people do not fully understand or appreciate what workers in physically demanding, labor-intensive occupations, such as longshoremen, have gone through,” said Steve Rollins, who was deputy associate commissioner of the Social Security Administration’s Office of Disability Policy during the latter years of the first Trump administration and associate commissioner through the Biden administration. Rollins oversaw the agency’s work on modernizing the disability program from 2019 to 2024.
What’s more, vocational experts said in interviews, even if 50- or 60-year-old former coal miners or factory workers are denied the disability benefits they say they need, they’re still likely to retire early, a finding backed by recent research. After all, if they try to get a desk job — assuming one is available in their rural or exurban community — they may feel they don’t have the education or training for it, and they may also be subject to age discrimination in the hiring process. As Michelle Aliff, a certified rehabilitation counselor who testifies at Social Security disability hearings nationwide as an impartial vocational expert, put it: “An oil field roustabout in his 50s isn’t going to just sit down at a computer for work without additional training.”
The Trump administration’s plan to transform the U.S. disability system, once finalized, would interact with other cuts to the social safety net that the president and Republicans in Congress have already authored. For example, under legislation dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and signed into law by Trump, work requirements will be added to Medicaid; people with disabilities will largely be exempt, but the best way to establish eligibility for that exemption is to qualify for Social Security’s disability program, which would become harder under the new rule. A disabled worker could instead turn to Obamacare’s individual exchanges for insurance coverage, but Republicans are allowing the tax credit that makes those premiums affordable to expire.
Tincher feels lucky he applied when he did. Being approved for disability has meant his copays are covered, he can finally afford groceries and he has time to help watch over his grandkids. Still, he also feels a tinge of guilt. “I wish every day I could still work,” he said. His dad, a coal miner, once told him to work until the day he died. “Having to ask for help is hard especially for men to do, men of my generation.”
All Tincher would say to the officials pushing the changes to the disability program, he said, is “you don’t know until you’re here, at this point in a working life.”

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Voters just approved the Vibrant Bond package, authorizing nearly $1 billion for construction across Denver. It’s the role of the Denver Auditor’s Office to provide oversight of that construction: Fair contracting and prevailing wage enforcement keeps projects on track, protects workers, and levels the field for responsible firms. Labor compliance is a core project risk that the Denver Auditor should track in real time.
Large bond packages attract bidders, including some who cut corners. Misclassification and wage theft distort bids, punish rule-followers, and often lead to delays and overruns. The answer is to embed labor oversight in construction delivery rather than chase violations after the fact.
Start with certified payroll in a usable format. Require machine-readable certified payroll every pay period for all bond-funded work, including for subcontractors. The Denver Auditor’s office can publish project and contractor-level compliance summaries while protecting personal data, and sample classifications, hours, and rates against wage determinations and project records. These are capabilities this division has already shown they can do effectively, so they should seek to standardize that work in this bond.

Do unannounced field checks, too. Short site visits can be used to confirm worker classification, overtime, apprenticeship utilization, and safety. Log findings promptly and route corrective action through the contract. This protects the interests of workers and taxpayers. Short site visits deter violations with minimum disruption.
The City of Denver should also tie payments to compliance. Make retainage release contingent on documented wage compliance through closeout for primes and subs. If findings or unpaid damages remain, retainage is held. This aligns incentives with following the rule of law on wage and labor topics.
It is also critical that the city protects the voices of workers on these publicly-funded projects. Maintain a multilingual reporting channel with anonymous tips and post anti-retaliation rules and wage rates at every site entrance. When workers know their rights and have an avenue to report, issues surface early and projects are more successful.
The city should also consider community workforce benefits for large bond projects. Set measurable goals for apprenticeships in partnership with labor unions, support local hiring, and incentivize participation for small or disadvantaged businesses in our community.
Finally, build in more proactive construction auditing practices. As vendors are onboarded, require a short compliance briefing prior to work beginning. Cover information about wage determinations, record-keeping, and audit standards. Start clean by setting clear expectations. Prevent findings instead of just reporting them later after the damage has already been done.
This approach is fair to everyone. Workers get the pay the law requires. Responsible contractors compete on execution, not shortcuts. Taxpayers get projects that finish without avoidable time delays or cost overruns.
This bond package will shape the future of our parks, streets, and public facilities. If managed well, it will also build trust. The Denver Auditor has an opportunity to show what strong construction oversight can do to support workers and contribute to success. Let’s hold this Vibrant Bond and ourselves to the high standards that the people of Denver deserve from their leaders.

Dozens of community members asked the Detroit school district on Tuesday night to update its sanctuary policy and train all staff on how to interact with immigration enforcement.
Speakers at the board meeting also asked the Detroit Public Schools Community District to protect students outside of school buildings and provide more transportation options for families with immigration concerns. Community members asked for in-school counseling for students at risk for immigration enforcement, referrals to legal services, and more resources for language acquisition classrooms.
Kristen Schoettle, an English language teacher at Western International High School, told the board DPSCD’s 2019 “Sanctuary District” policy needs to be updated.
“As we all know, a lot has changed since 2019,” she said. “We have to do more than simply say ICE isn’t allowed in school buildings.”
The concerns were raised as federal immigration agencies have ramped up enforcement, including arrests of parents and teens outside school buildings. Last week, a child care worker was dragged by federal agents from the Chicago center where she worked.
Though dozens showed up to address the districts’ policies around immigration concerns, the board asked for three representatives from the group to each speak for up to six minutes.
Some speakers ignored the board’s request and made additional comments in support of protecting immigrant students and families. The board did not stop them from speaking.
Chair Corletta Vaughn offered pamphlets on immigration resources to those at the meeting.
“You are not alone and we are 100% in support of all of our students and families,” said Vaughn.
The district’s sanctuary policy requires the superintendent’s office and general counsel to sign off before staff allow immigration agents with warrants to enter school property or access student data.
In January, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said the district would begin training principals, assistant principals, guidance counselors, attendance agents, and security guards on the protocols. Community members want all staff to be included.
“We want to know who has been officially trained,” said Heidi West, a teacher at Academy of the Americas. “Do our secretaries and security guards know what to do if ICE is right outside or trying to get in?”
West said she and many other staff members feel unprepared and want training.
“This is the very least we should be doing to be proactive and make sure everyone is protected,” she said.
Schoettle said other public school districts, including in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, have mandatory training for all staff, regular “Know Your Rights” presentations and in-school counseling.
Schoettle told Chalkbeat that better communication with bilingual families is needed in the district. A robo call sent out by the district last month intended to quell rumors about immigration actions in the community caused “chaos,” she said.
Schoettle said the call only went out in English and it was misinterpreted by families, creating confusion and fear. The next day, about 15% of her class was absent, she said.
Frank Espinosa, another teacher at Western International, asked the board to provide better transportation for undocumented students and families with mixed immigration status.
As the district explores ways to use additional state funding to get kids to school, Schoettle said DPSCD should invest in more ride shares for families with immigration fears.
“There are undocumented parents who risk their safety every day to take their kids to school,” she said.
Vitti responded to the speakers’ concerns Tuesday night, saying any changes to the sanctuary policy would have to be made by the board, adding he would assist them administratively.
No members of the board responded to the speakers’ concerns after the public comment.
The school system has enrolled more newcomers and English learners in recent years. Last school year, there were more than 7,400 English learners, which represented 15% of the district’s students.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration ended a policy that deemed schools and day cares “sensitive locations” protected from immigration enforcement.
The administration’s immigration enforcement policies and increased arrests have impacted Detroit families, prompting fear in neighborhoods and schools for months.
In June, hundreds gathered at a board meeting to ask school leaders to decry the immigration arrest of DPSCD student Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an undocumented teen from Colombia. After hours of public comment, the board reversed course and made a statement asking for Maykol’s release.
Days later, he was deported.
At October’s DPSCD board meeting, Vitti responded to several people who asked the district to provide “Know Your Rights” immigration enforcement training for students.
“I’ve certainly heard today the need for training and information sessions for our families that are fearful of ICE,” he said during the meeting. “I’ll work with the team and legal counsel to determine what exactly we can and can’t do, but obviously, as a district, we want to do everything we can in support of our students and our families.”
Vitti added that the district has never been contacted by ICE or given information to the agency.

Are they commodities in a market built around relapse and reimbursement, or are they part of our shared infrastructure — something we maintain and strengthen because our communities depend on it? (Getty Images)I entered Genesis Recovery Center in Grayson because of my alcoholism by choice, not by court order.
The building looked worn, a physical manifestation of the lives inside, stitched together, imperfect, but still standing. In a culture where things are increasingly disposable, it’s reassuring to find a place that values repairing over discarding — a kind of micro-service economy where both the building and the people are mended rather than thrown away.
Genesis is part of Recovery Kentucky, a statewide network of 16 long-term, peer-run recovery centers created through a partnership among the Kentucky Housing Corp., the Department of Corrections and local nonprofits. The program began in 2005 to reduce homelessness and addiction-related incarceration by offering free community-based recovery housing. Participants stay six to 12 months, work, attend meetings and mentor newcomers. Funding comes from state and federal grants rather than private insurance, so care doesn’t end when coverage does.
What makes Recovery Kentucky distinct is that it’s peer-run. People who’ve already completed the program help operate it — supervising chores, leading groups and mentoring newcomers. Staff members aren’t outsiders with clipboards; they’re graduates who’ve stayed to give back. That structure builds accountability no policy memo can. When someone stumbles, it’s often another resident, not a professional, who helps them stand up again. It also builds leadership — many graduates go on to work in treatment, social services or re-entry programs, carrying that ethic of peer support into other corners of the state.
The public model looks different from the insurance-driven programs many Kentuckians know. In those settings, a person’s length of stay often depends on the reimbursement schedule, not readiness. Recovery Kentucky trades paperwork for accountability. Residents cook, clean and answer to one another. It isn’t glamorous, and neither is addiction, but the approach builds something sturdier than abstinence: belonging.
The difference matters as Kentucky debates how to sustain and expand treatment access. Private networks such as Addiction Recovery Care (ARC) have grown quickly through Medicaid billing, and some now face federal scrutiny over documentation and profit motives. ARC, now being acquired by the Florida-based company Ethema Health Corp., shows how out-of-state investors are moving into Kentucky’s recovery industry. Recovery Kentucky moves more slowly and on a smaller budget, yet its results show up in jails, shelters and workplaces. A graduate who stays sober, gains employment, and mentors others is one less person cycling through emergency rooms or court dockets.
The real question is how we see people in recovery. Are they commodities in a market built around relapse and reimbursement, or are they part of our shared infrastructure — something we maintain and strengthen because our communities depend on it? One model extracts value through billing codes; the other creates value through belonging and contribution. The return on investment isn’t measured in profit margins but in families kept whole, jobs filled, and neighborhoods made steadier.
We already treat bridges and highways as investments that connect towns. Recovery Kentucky shows that people can serve the same purpose. When someone rebuilds a life, they also rebuild the capacity of their community — the workforce, the tax base, the shared belief that improvement is possible. The infrastructure metaphor isn’t just symbolic; it’s economic. Every graduate who stays sober and working keeps public dollars from being spent on jail beds, foster care and emergency rooms.
This isn’t an argument for one model over every other. Kentucky needs multiple paths to recovery. But the public, peer-run system offers lessons policymakers shouldn’t overlook: consistency, community ownership and low cost per participant. The programs rely on modest state support, and that funding is a fraction of what relapse and incarceration cost taxpayers.
When politicians talk about rebuilding Appalachia, they usually mean roads and broadband. Those things matter, but none of them last if the people who live here can’t participate. Recovery is infrastructure. It rebuilds a workforce, a family, a sense of purpose. And like the old building in Grayson, what’s been repaired by hand often lasts the longest.
If Kentucky invested in recovery infrastructure the way it invests in highways, how many lives and towns could we reconnect?",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2164284264-1024x833.jpg,,,2025-11-12 05:57:11.691483

(Photo courtesy of Norfolk International Airport)Richmond resident Brianna Curry didn’t expect her trip home from a veterinary conference in Hawaii to include shivering at Chicago O’Hare International Airport in a sundress. Her connecting flight to Norfolk was canceled Monday morning — one of thousands scrubbed nationwide as the federal government shutdown rippled through the aviation system.
“They rescheduled for the next day,” Curry said. “It’s 20 degrees in Chicago and I only had Hawaii clothes.”
After pleading with exhausted airline staff, she snagged the last seat on a later flight — just as her co-worker, initially stranded on standby, was called aboard moments before takeoff. The pair landed in Norfolk hours behind schedule but grateful to be among the lucky few who made it home.
As the shutdown stretches through its sixth week, air travel across the country — and in Virginia — has begun to buckle under mounting pressure. 
Over 11,000 Federal Aviation Administration employees have been furloughed nationwide, while more than 13,200 air traffic controllers are reporting to work without pay, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Even before the shutdown, Virginia was navigating a shortage of controllers at nine airports statewide. 
The FAA has ordered a gradual nationwide flight reduction to maintain safety standards amid worsening staffing shortages. 
A 4% cut took effect Friday, ramping up to 6% Monday and projected to reach 10% by week’s end at 40 major airports, including Washington Dulles International and Ronald Reagan Washington National.
Controller shortages led to average delays of four hours at Chicago O’Hare and 45 minutes in Las Vegas on Monday. The FAA warned that similar disruptions could spread to cities including Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta.
 Virginia’s airports holding on — for now

Virginia, home to about 1,110 air traffic controllers — among the highest concentrations in the nation — has so far avoided major slowdowns. 
Officials at Richmond International Airport said Monday that while a few flights were delayed or canceled, the disruptions were largely “related to mandatory flight reductions” at other airports.
“At this time, RIC has not been directly affected by the federal government shutdown or by any associated flight reductions,” the airport said in a statement. Federal workers with the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection remain on duty, officials said.
The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority — which oversees Dulles and Reagan National — said its locally managed operations such as parking, concessions and public safety remain unaffected. But it warned that “the staffing of essential federal services such as security screening and air traffic control is unfunded and could affect flight schedules or security checkpoint wait times.”
Both agencies urged passengers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport and to arrive early — two hours before domestic flights and three hours for international departures.
 Safety first, officials say

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in a statement that the agency’s flight reductions are meant to “maintain the highest standards of safety” in the national airspace system.
“My department has many responsibilities, but our number one job is safety,” Duffy said. “This isn’t about politics — it’s about assessing the data and alleviating building risk in the system as controllers continue to work without pay.”
Bedford said the agency is monitoring operations closely and “will not hesitate to take further action to make sure air travel remains safe.”
The FAA has also restricted visual flight rule approaches, parachute operations and photo missions near facilities with critical staffing shortages. Commercial space launches and reentries are now confined to overnight hours.
 Controllers working without pay

For Virginia’s more than 1,100 controllers, the shutdown has meant continuing one of the most stressful jobs in government — without a paycheck. Many have taken on second jobs or dipped into savings to cover bills, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
“This is the erosion of the safety margin the public never sees, but the American public relies upon every day,” Nick Daniels, the union’s president, said in a news conference Monday.
Daniels previously said controllers are “working ten-hour days and six-day workweeks due to the ongoing staffing shortage, all without pay,” warning that the situation “creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work.”
“For this nation’s air traffic controllers, missing just one paycheck can be a significant hardship,” Daniels said. “Asking them to go without a full month’s pay or more is simply not sustainable.”
He called on Congress to “pass a clean continuing resolution to immediately end the government shutdown, ensure that all individuals who have not been paid during this prolonged closure receive their compensation, and then engage in bipartisan negotiations on other pressing issues facing our nation.”
On Monday evening, the U.S. Senate narrowly approved an agreement on a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government and end the shutdown, after seven Democrats — including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia — and one independent joined Republicans to advance the measure. 
The deal, which keeps agencies funded through early January, now heads to the House, where swift passage is expected after weeks of mounting pressure from federal workers and the aviation sector.
Virginia already entered the shutdown crisis with a staffing shortfall in its air‐traffic control workforce.
According to the FAA’s 11-year workforce plan, the commonwealth was missing 133 certified professional controllers across nine facilities as of early 2025 — including 15 at the Norfolk Tower and 33 at the Potomac TRACON.
 TSA stretches thin

At the nation’s airports, Transportation Security Administration officers — among 64,000 federal employees nationwide — are also working without pay. A TSA spokesperson cautioned in October that “an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.”
“TSA will continue operations to keep the traveling public safe,” the spokesperson said. “We kindly ask for our passengers’ patience during this time.”
The TSA’s lost and found office at Reagan National has closed due to staffing limits, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority said, urging passengers to “be extra mindful of your belongings in the security screening area.”
 Federal workers feel the squeeze

The shutdown’s toll extends far beyond airport terminals. The federal government employs about 147,000 Virginians — from defense analysts in Northern Virginia to meteorologists in Blacksburg — making the state among the hardest hit economically.
For federal aviation workers, the strain is both financial and emotional. Many controllers and TSA employees say morale has plummeted as they balance safety-critical responsibilities with the uncertainty of missed paychecks.
TSA and other federal workers saw their first zero paycheck Oct. 24. As Tuesday marked their second pay cycle without pay, some have turned to food banks and credit unions offering emergency loans.
But for now, Virginia’s airports remain mostly operational — a testament to the thousands of unpaid workers who keep planes moving and passengers safe. However, officials warn that the system’s resilience has limits.
“We are the rope in this tug of war game that we shouldn’t be the rope,” said NATCA President Daniels. “This has nothing to do with us… The real story is that America’s air traffic control system is falling further behind because of this shutdown.”

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)Continuity gaps within Virginia’s artificial intelligence registry are raising concerns about transparency, oversight and the implementation of standards across state government, state researchers said Monday. 
JLARC provided lawmakers an update on the registry as part of an ongoing review of the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA), which services 65 executive branch agencies, security, project management, procurement and information technology planning for the commonwealth. The registry’s purpose is to track and approve state projects that would use AI technology.  
Researchers said that as of Oct. 31, VITA approved 90 out of about 182 cases that were submitted by state agencies frustrated with the agency’s process guidance and the registry using multiple systems that are “not well coordinated.” VITA said the total approved registry AI cases increased to 112 at Monday’s meeting.
“One theme that emerged through all of these conversations is that VITA does not have one singular voice around AI for agencies,” said Kimberly Sarte, associate director for ongoing oversight and fiscal analysis for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). “We heard the different teams within VITA may have different answers to the same question depending on when they were asked.” 
Sarte added that VITA is working to establish a “centralized AI information role, which will also bring them in line with our peer states.”

VITA was required to establish IT security standards under an executive order signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Jan. 18, 2024.
From the order, VITA created Virginia’s AI registry for agencies to submit potential AI use cases, or projects, for review and approval by VITA. Cases are approved based on whether there is a “positive outcome for citizens,” according to the state standards published by VITA.
The state standards also require agencies to examine alternative technologies and processes before choosing AI, to develop a regulatory impact analysis, and to clearly state whether AI will make recommendations or decisions on behalf of users. 
Sarte said the AI tools Smartling and CoPilot Chat have been made available to all executive branches.
Some of the approved 90 cases include the Virginia Racing Commission using meeting transcription for hearings, the Department of Corrections improving facility monitoring and security and VITA developing a chatbot to help users navigate its website.
However, the problem researchers identified is that case status is not updated regularly, and some agencies are unclear about which types of use cases to include and are not reporting them.
Researchers are also unclear whether the cases not entered into the registry comply with state standards.
Sarte said VITA is working to address some of the frustrations including developing an AI resource team to reduce inconsistent guidance.
Bob Osman, chief information officer for VITA, did not directly address the frustrations expressed by agencies. However, he did say the registry is a key part of the agency’s approach to AI oversight.
On Monday, Osman presented a chart that indicated that the use of AI is accelerating. AI is currently being used to help the Department of Transportation determine when roads need to be paved, to aid the Department of Quality review and approve water permits faster and help VITA create programs faster with fewer mistakes, improving government technology tools more efficiently.
“If you look at the results, we’ve come a long way in terms of where we got started, and in terms of the number of use cases (that) are approved in Virginia,” Osman said, “and we’re finding more and more use cases as agencies look at opportunities and try to learn about ways of taking advantage and harnessing this really powerful technology.”
He added that “every job is going to involve some kind of AI. There’s just no way around it.”
Relatedly, Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, who represents Virginia, and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri introduced bipartisan legislation called the AI-Related Jobs Clarity Act. The bill aims to track jobs lost to AI as part of a broader effort to increase transparency about AI use in government. 
Under the proposed legislation, major companies and federal agencies would be required to report AI-related layoffs to the U.S. Department of Labor, which would compile them into a publicly available report.
“Good policy starts with good data,”  Warner said in a Nov. 5 statement. “This bipartisan legislation will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce – what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging. 
The goal is to “make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind,” Warner said.

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Maine lawmakers will meet Wednesday afternoon to discuss a proposal that would restore someone’s right to possess a firearm after being convicted of a nonviolent felony. 
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee has a work session scheduled for 1:30 p.m. to discuss LD 1009, the proposal from Rep. Chad Perkins (R-Dover-Foxcroft) that would provide an avenue to restore certain rights for a person convicted of a nonviolent felony after they have repaid their debt to society. The legislation, which was carried over from the first session, stipulates that those rights can’t be restored until 10 years after any imposed sentence is completed. 
The committee held a public hearing for the bill on May 1, during which the Department of Public Safety came out against the measure due to limited resources that would make it difficult to take on the additional workload it would require. While the judicial branch testified neither for nor against the proposal, a representative pointed out that there is not a current digital mechanism for the department to communicate this sort of information with the courts nor does the bill leave room for any judicial review. 
During the public hearing, Perkins was asked if he would support an alternative approach, such as reclassifying those nonviolent crimes. However, he declined saying there needs to be some price to bring justice for victims but said he is open to amending the process for one’s rights to be restored, so long as it maintains the intent of the bill. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, there were no amendments listed on the committee’s website.
The committee held two work sessions back in May, but didn’t take action on the proposal and carried it over to the next session, which technically starts in January. 
The bill isn’t the only gun reform that the committee is slated to revisit. It also opted to wait to take action on proposed legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases because of an ongoing lawsuit over the law. 
A bill that would require the Department of Public Safety to adopt rules specifying minimum security requirements for gun shops, LD 1821, was also carried over from last session.

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/ Virginia Mercury)A provision significantly limiting the sale of intoxicating hemp products made its way into legislation to reopen the federal government just a day before the Senate approved the bill. Its inclusion follows years of pressure from states and the marijuana industry.
While states continue to expand access to legal marijuana, a separate market of hemp-derived intoxicants has blossomed. The products, from drinks to gummies, are sold in gas stations and smoke shops. Critics say some companies have exploited a legal loophole from 2018 to manufacture products that get people high — without the safety regulations and taxes facing the legal marijuana industry.
That’s led dozens of states to limit or ban certain intoxicating hemp products. Most states also have pushed for federal changes, though some farm states worry the pending federal bill — which the House is expected to vote on as soon as today — goes too far.
A bipartisan group of 39 state attorneys general recently urged Congress to clarify the federal definition of hemp, arguing that the underregulated industry threatens public health and undermines law enforcement.
Texas lawmakers this year approved a strict ban on intoxicating hemp, but that measure was vetoed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor raised constitutional concerns because federal law allowed the products, but he then issued an executive order increasing state agency regulations, including age restrictions.
This summer, Florida regulators seized tens of thousands of packages of hemp products that failed to meet new child protection standards, including child-resistant packaging, marketing restrictions and enhanced labeling rules. In Tallahassee, the state Senate approved a ban on hemp-derived THC products, including beverages, but that measure died in the state House. A similar effort last year was vetoed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said it would harm small businesses.
Last month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation strengthening state enforcement of its ban on intoxicating hemp products. Similarly, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine declared an emergency last month in an executive order banning intoxicating hemp products for 90 days while lawmakers debate potential legislation.
Missouri hemp businesses fear new federal THC limits will destroy the industry

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the primary psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. The 39 state attorneys general argue manufacturers are manipulating hemp to produce synthetic THC that can be more intoxicating than marijuana.
“In this way, legal, nonintoxicating hemp is used to make Frankenstein THC products that get adults high and harm and even kill children,” the attorneys general wrote.
Hemp-derived gummies and beverages are sold without consistent age restrictions or labeling regulations and oftentimes resemble candy. During his announcement, DeWine showcased brightly packaged intoxicating hemp products that resembled name-brand candy products.
“Certainly, it’s easy to see how a child will confuse this product with real candy and eat a few gummy bears and ingest enough THC to require hospitalization,” he said, according to the Ohio Capital Journal.
Though it has faced mounting restrictions in the states, the hemp industry says the federal change poses an existential threat.
On Monday, the U.S. Hemp Roundtable said the legislation pending in Congress would wipe out 95% of the nation’s $28.4 billion hemp industry.
“The language will force patients, seniors and veterans who rely on hemp products to break federal criminal law to acquire them,” the trade group posted online.
Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the organization, said the industry has been pushing for regulation rather than outright prohibition. He acknowledged the problem of bad actors, but said those can be addressed with strong regulations like those that exist in Kentucky and Minnesota.
“These are good examples of states that have put together robust regulations. But we need to see that at the federal level, and we’ve been supporting legislation to do that for the last seven years,” he told Stateline.
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s senior senator, said he included the hemp measure in the bill to close an unintended legal loophole and that the measure would still allow farmers to grow hemp for fiber, oil and drug trials.
But fellow Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said the move would “eradicate the hemp industry” and could override some state laws. Paul offered an amendment to remove the hemp provision but failed.
The hemp loophole
Hemp derives from the same cannabis species as marijuana, but is legally defined by its lower levels of THC, the psychoactive component of the plant.
While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Congress sanctioned hemp in the 2018 farm bill to allow an agricultural market for hemp-based textiles, animal feeds and human wellness products centered on cannabidiol, or CBD, products. The farm bill allowed cultivation of hemp plants with a THC concentration of 0.3% or lower by dry weight.
But that threshold has become essentially meaningless, said Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.
That’s because manufacturers have found ways to convert legal hemp plants into potent forms of synthetic marijuana. Aside from the potential of creating very strong products, she said the process requires the addition of solvents and other ingredients that raise many safety questions.
Kratom faces increasing scrutiny from states and the feds

“With marijuana products, you can get some very potent products,” she said. “But the psychoactive components to THC are naturally occurring. It naturally occurs in that natural amount. You’re not doing a whole bunch of manipulation to increase the potency of the product and adding ingredients.”
Harris has tracked the growing number of states regulating the industry: Six states and the District of Columbia now ban all consumable hemp products with any amount of THC. In 24 states, intoxicating hemp products are permitted, though 15 of those states allow only low-potency products.
But even states with strict regulations still must contend with legal online markets.
“There’s a big part of that activity that you can’t control as a state when something is federally legal, and so that’s one thing that they’re asking for is federal leadership on this issue,” she said. “I think there is a big demand for some sort of industry standards.”
If approved by Congress and signed by the president, as expected, the new hemp legislation will likely have uneven impacts across the states.
For example, the change likely won’t dramatically alter the legal landscape in Alaska, where the regulators have banned all intoxicating hemp products. Marijuana businesses complain those products are still being sold, despite the ban.
But in a state like Nebraska, where lawmakers have been unsuccessful in limiting intoxicating hemp, the change could drastically alter both consumer access and business sales, depending on enforcement.
On Monday, Paul said the federal legislation would wipe away hemp regulations in many states, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine and Utah.
“The bill before us nullifies all these state laws,” he said.
‘Running with knives’
The hemp industry has argued that a lot of the opposition to it stems from marijuana businesses looking to protect their own markets, noting that campaigns for restrictions are often more organized in states that have legalized marijuana.










Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.


– Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association


But producers of intoxicating hemp are looking for market access without the associated safety regulations and tax structures states have created for marijuana, argued Chris Lindsey, the director of state advocacy and public policy at the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp, an organization representing the legal marijuana industry.
“They want to have some kind of regulatory framework that’s somehow different than the one that states already have [for marijuana],” he said.
His organization cheered the Senate’s efforts “to address the dangerous proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products.”
Lindsey said hemp-derived products can contain contaminants, including pesticides. Many hemp products can be sourced cheaply overseas, he said, and with lax oversight, there is no system to recall tainted products here.
“To me, that’s like running with knives,” he told Stateline.
Floridians react to federal legislation that could ‘devastate’ state’s hemp industry

The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association recently purchased hemp products from gas stations and smoke shops from across the state to test them in an effort to show they need more regulation.
In its “Missouri Hemp Hoax Report,” the organization said independent testing found 53 of the 55 products purchased were actually intoxicating marijuana well above the legal limit of THC. Third-party lab results also showed some of the products contained pesticides and heavy metals.
Those results underscore that the products should face the same rules as legal marijuana does, said Andrew Mullins, president and executive director of the cannabis trade association. State law requires marijuana to be grown and manufactured in Missouri, mandates lab testing and allows for sales only at licensed dispensaries.
“In my mind, if it’s marijuana, which most of this is, then it should be regulated like marijuana,” Mullins said.
He said calling the unregulated products “hemp” is akin to someone selling whiskey and calling it corn: “Everybody is using hemp as a cover to basically sell intoxicating drugs.”
Mullins acknowledged the confusion among policymakers and law enforcement. But he said there are already laws — including those against trafficking marijuana without a license — that could help address the issue.
Catherine Hanaway, a Republican who was sworn in as Missouri’s new attorney general in September, has vowed action on unregulated hemp products, particularly THC beverages that are booming in popularity.
“Our focus is on the health and safety of Missourians,” James Lawson, her deputy chief of staff, told the Missouri Independent last month. “This is an unregulated industry that makes untested, unknown substances available to the public without any oversight, including children where we think it’s particularly detrimental.”

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)New Ohio legislation that would require doctors to read a legal statement before medication abortions telling patients they can sue them could create a new barrier to constitutionally protected abortion care, experts say.
The Republican-led Ohio Senate Bill 309 would require health care providers who prescribe drugs to induce an abortion to also provide a statement and written information to patients about their ability to sue their health care providers, before the drugs can be prescribed.
The statement included in the language of the bill would read that “the state of Ohio wants you to be aware that you and your family may hold the manufacturer, distributor, your health care provider and the health care facilities financially accountable” if the patients dies, is injured, or suffers complications.
Providers, facilities, and manufacturers would also be held liable for “debilitating side effects” such as rupture of unknown ectopic pregnancy or infection “if the provider doesn’t address the side effect,” or “if the medication fails to terminate the pregnancy which results in a failed abortion or requires surgical intervention.”
Doctors, researchers, and advocates alike say the bill could bring a chilling effect to the relationship between doctors and their patients.
“I think it could be really damaging to the physician-patient relationship,” said Dr. Tracy Griffith, and OB/GYN at University Hospitals and a member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. “It feels like it’s designed to produce mistrust.”
Griffith said she and other doctors are already trained to provide the risks of any medication they prescribe, and to have conversations about what’s best for the individual patient with whom they’re working.
The training extends to treatment of any complications that might arise, and always has, according to Griffith.
The new measure in the Ohio legislature wouldn’t address any supposed issues with the medication itself that anti-abortion groups and anti-abortion lawmakers bring up.
“This bill isn’t going to improve the safety of this medication, it’s not going to improve the medical advice I give them,” Griffith said.
“It’s going to scare providers away from providing the medicine or scare patients away from this option.”
Conducting a medication abortion before providing the statement of legal liability could result in lawsuits from the patients, the maternal grandparents if the patient was a minor or died during the procedure, and the “father of the unborn child, if the father is married to the woman” at the time of the medication abortion, according to the bill.
The pregnant person’s next of kin could also sue the providers, facilities, and drug manufacturers if the person dies “due to the abortion or a complication related to the abortion.”
Those suing due to the medication abortion could ask for three times the cost of the medication, along with “damages for injuries and loss.”
The fact that the legal liability is singularly targeted at medication abortion is a giant red flag for Griffith, in a state that has constitutional protections for abortion care but also has a Republican-majority legislature who has produced several bills to try to further regulate reproductive health care.
“There is no other field of medicine where we’re talking about potential criminalization of care,” Griffith said.
Anti-abortion lobby group Ohio Right to Life released a statement saying they approve of the bill.
“Women who are facing a difficult choice should be given all the information they need to make such a critical decision,” said Ohio Right to Life Executive Director Carrie Snyder, in a statement.
“It is our hope that more women will see the dangers of abortion pills and make the decision to choose life, for their baby and themselves.”
The medication abortion option has been proven to be a safe one, with studies showing very rare rates of serious medical problems, even when administered through telehealth.
The rates are comparable or safer than over-the-counter pain relievers.
A 2024 study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that, of more than 6,000 medication abortions obtained through telehealth studied in the research, 97.7% “were complete without subsequent known intervention or ongoing pregnancy after the initial treatment.”
The study also found that 99.8% of the medication abortions did not include “serious adverse events.”
A 2015 study in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology studied women in the California Medicaid program who had an abortion, and found less than 1% of patients sought emergency room care for an abortion-related complication after the procedure.
For medication abortion specifically, the study found a “major complication rate” of 0.16%.
In comparison, about 1% to 2% of users of pain relievers like Advil and Aleve “experienced a serious (gastrointestinal) complication during treatment,” according to a 2013 study.
Epidemiology professor Alison Norris has already spent time in the Statehouse providing data for lawmakers on bills that could directly and indirectly impact reproductive health care and abortion medication.
She is ready to do it again for the newest measure.
“Holding medical providers who offer abortion care to a different standard is illogical,” Norris told the Capital Journal.
The professor is also the co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network (OPEN), a group of professors and academic researchers throughout Ohio and other states specifically focused on researching abortion and contraception policy impacts.
“We know that when there are a large number of regulations, it creates an environment in which it’s hard, sometimes impossible, to provide the standard of care that we want to,” Norris said.
With a standard of care that already includes providing patients with the risks and benefits of treatment and the likelihood of complications, Norris said “creating a complicated legal milieu makes it harder for providers to provider their care in the very best way.”
Because the safety of medication abortion has been so scientifically proven, Norris said, it would be better if more and more providers were able to offer the care, rather than regulating the treatment in a way that discourages use.
“The evidence is that it’s common, it’s safe, it’s very acceptable for people,” Norris said. “There’s all kinds of people for whom that is the best care, and we should be reducing the barriers to excellent care.”
Clinics like Planned Parenthood in Ohio are, at this point, used to legislation that attempts to regulate around the constitutional amendment 57% of Ohioans approved in 2023, and they see this as yet another “political attack.”
“This is another example of lawmakers not listening to the constituents’ will,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.
“It demonstrates that these are not lawmakers who are invested in serving their communities … but their own interests.”
The new legislation has been referred to the Ohio Senate Health Committee, but has not yet had a hearing scheduled.

Photos courtesy of candidatesA Democratic challenger focused on health care and housing and a local Republican business owner have officially qualified to compete in a special election to fill a vacant House seat in northeast Georgia.
Republican Mack “Dutch” Guest IV and Democrat Eric Gisler are on the ballot for the House District 121 special election on Tuesday, Dec. 9. Early voting starts Monday, Nov. 17.
The December special election was called after the abrupt resignation of Republican State Rep. Marcus Wiedower from Watkinsville, who stepped down to focus on his work as vice president of external affairs at the real estate firm Hillpointe. The district, which covers parts of Clarke and Oconee counties, is considered conservative-leaning, with Wiedower winning his last election with 61% of the vote.
Gisler, a tech executive and small business owner who challenged Wiedower in 2024, said he feels he has a chance to flip the seat in the special election after Georgia and national Democrats outperformed in the November elections and flipped two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission in a landslide, winning statewide constitutional offices in Georgia for the first time since 2006.
“Reaching out to the same people, Democratic voters who voted last week, and thanking them for that, and asking them to turn out one more time to vote for me, and I think that gives us a real shot at winning this election,” Gisler said.

Gisler’s platform centers on increasing access to health care, addressing housing affordability and strengthening voting rights.
He said in an interview Tuesday that federal cuts to programs like health insurance and education are being ignored by state leaders.
“We need to look at innovative ways that the state of Georgia can step up and increase access to health, whether that’s financially or even just geographically,” Gisler said, pointing to the impending expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies that is likely to significantly increase the number of uninsured Georgians.
And Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey echoed the sentiment in a statement.
“Democrats won this month’s PSC races not just in traditionally blue counties, but in swing counties and even deep-red counties that voted upwards of 60% for Trump last year. It’s proof positive that when Democrats invest, organize, and compete everywhere, we can’t be counted out anywhere,” Bailey said.
Democrats overperformed in every county in the state in this month’s off-year special elections except two: Webster and Miller counties. Those results were also influenced by municipal elections that favored Democrats.
Democrats rush to seize momentum after Georgia victories built on affordability messaging

Carmen Bergman, director of the House Republican Caucus, downplayed Democrats’ confidence in a statement, saying that Republicans have a “year-round political operation” and aren’t “relying on any real or imagined waves to guide electoral outcomes.”
“If Democrats think they can ride momentum into House District 121, they’re going to find the tide’s gone out,” Bergman said.
Republicans control 100 seats in the 180-seat chamber.
In a press release announcing his candidacy, Guest framed his campaign around local concerns. His core priorities are improving transportation, strengthening education and keeping communities safe. Guest helps run LAD Truck Lines, a Watkinsville-based transportation business, has served as president of the Oconee County Rotary Club and entered the race with endorsements from Oconee County Commissioner Mark Thomas and Sheriff James Hale.
“I want to focus on the issues that matter most to the people who call this district home,” Guest said in a statement. “In Atlanta, every decision I make will be for our families, for our businesses, and for our values. That’s what this campaign is all about, standing up for hardworking Georgians.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gisler-Guest-e1762899420766.png,,,2025-11-12 05:57:11.691483

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)This is the second in a three-part series on New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. You can read Part I here, and Part III will be published on Friday.

THEY CALL IT the disability cliff.
When young people with intellectual and developmental disabilities finish high school, they lose access to the extensive services provided by public school special education programs. Most parents work, and while that allows them to help support their adult children financially, their absence creates a care void that is not easy to fill.
Over many months, the Bulletin has explored abuse and neglect in New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability system through court filings, law enforcement documents, state records, and conversations with lawyers, advocates, and family members. Breakdowns in care in recent years have led to many instances of preventable harm — sometimes fatal harm — and left in their wake devastated families who wanted only to give their children opportunities for a good life but found tragedy instead.
Those tragedies often begin at the precarious edge of the disability cliff — and that was the case for the Weidlich family.
‘Looking for a body’
When Stephen “Stevie” Weidlich Jr. aged out of high school in 2017 at Crotched Mountain School for Students with Disabilities in Greenfield, his father, Stephen Weidlich Sr., saw few options.
Weidlich worked full time and Stevie’s mother wasn’t involved in his life. He considered trying to get designated by the state as an in-home care provider of state services, which would have allowed him to receive some Medicaid funding as Stevie’s caregiver. Such arrangements typically cost the government a fraction of what placement in a residential facility costs.

However, the family felt discouraged about pursuing that path when an employee of PathWays of the River Valley, one of 10 agencies designated by the state Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services to coordinate care for people with disabilities, stopped responding to their inquiries on the matter, Weidlich said in a recent interview. 
The one option that remained was to place Stevie in a home run by PathWays with a live-in caregiver, a service people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are legally entitled to receive through Medicaid and other state and federal dollars. 
Within a few years, Stevie would become a casualty of that system. In December 2022, police knocked on the Weidlich family’s door in Unity to tell them Stevie’s body had been found in the woods behind the home of his caregiver.
At the time of his death, Stevie, 26, was living in Allenstown with PathWays employee Douglas Onkundi.

The Bulletin would like to speak with you. Please email wskipworth@newhampshirebulletin.com or send an encrypted message via Signal to WillSkipworth.80.

As a live-in caregiver, it was Onkundi’s responsibility to ensure Stevie, who had physical, developmental, and intellectual disabilities, was given 24/7 care. However, according to documents from a state investigation obtained and being made public for the first time by the Bulletin, Onkundi wasn’t actually living in the home at the time of Stevie’s death. He told police he was living in Manchester, and would return to Allenstown to give Stevie his medications. In his stead, investigators learned, Onkundi was paying another man to live in the home and care for Stevie with part of his PathWays paycheck and pocketing the rest. The man had no formal training and was not officially authorized by Pathways or Stevie’s family. Neither Onkundi nor the other man were criminally charged.
In conversations with state investigators, PathWays managers said they’d told Onkundi on multiple occasions only trained staff can work with the people in their care. However, according to the report, Onkundi said there was “an unwritten rule that everything was OK unless PathWays said otherwise.”
On Dec. 18, 2022, security camera footage from a neighbor shows Onkundi leaving the home in the morning and returning around 8 p.m. the day Stevie died, per the report. 
Investigators were told Stevie had locked himself in the bedroom and that when Onkundi returned, he used a ladder to climb up to the window and discovered the glass was broken and Stevie was gone. Onkundi told state investigators he searched for Stevie, who had a history of fleeing, before calling police.

It was too late. A police dog found Stevie’s body in the woods behind the home. There was evidence of hypothermia and a blunt force injury to Stevie’s ribs consistent with either a fall or a blow to the chest, the police report said. It was a cold night with snow on the ground.
Weidlich said Onkundi called him after the death and what he said infuriated him even more. 
“Stevie was not mobile,” he said. “He was in a wheelchair. He can only crawl. (Onkundi) told me when he noticed Stevie was gone, he got in his car and drove around looking for Stevie. How does that make any f—ing sense?”
Onkundi told him they were looking for “the body.”
“You were looking for a body or you were looking for Stevie?” he said. “Obviously, if you were looking for a body, what does that say? You weren’t looking for a live person.”
‘Daddy, I can’t see’
Stevie was born in Long Island, New York, in 1996 and spent his early childhood there. Weidlich said Stevie had “an awesome sense of humor,” and the whole family remembers him as fun-loving and a jokester. He was 9 years old when his disabilities began to emerge.
“One day, I’m getting ready to go to work,” Weidlich said. “And he comes down from upstairs holding onto the wall. He goes, ‘Daddy, I can’t see.’ And I’m looking at him, and he’s got one eye at me and one eye off.”
The family rushed Stevie to the hospital, where they learned he had a type of growth called a cavernous malformation inside his brainstem. He had emergency brain surgery the next day to remove the growth.

The surgery was successful, but it affected Stevie’s equilibrium and required him to start using a wheelchair.
In 2006, the family relocated to Unity, New Hampshire, where Weidlich’s father lived. Stevie had been “falling between the cracks with school,” Weidlich said, and his wife was struggling with an opioid addiction.
“I decided to fall back, regroup, put my wife in rehab, and we found this place,” he said. “I moved everybody up here.”
In New Hampshire, Stevie was able to regain the ability to walk without a wheelchair through rehabilitation services. However, about a year later he started losing his balance again, so the Weidlichs brought him to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, where doctors discovered the growth was returning. The family brought Stevie back to New York for a second surgery in 2010. This time, doctors clipped a nerve.
“So he went into it being able to walk,” Weidlich said. “And came out of it not being able to walk anymore.”
Stevie was diagnosed with mild intellectual and developmental disabilities, and he began having behavioral issues.
“The second surgery affected him much more,” Weidlich said. “He’d have anger issues, and he’d just be frustrated.”
After Stevie left Crotched Mountain in 2017, PathWays placed him with a live-in caretaker named Prashanna Sangroula. Weidlich’s work schedule made him unable to give his son the 24/7 care he required, so PathWays provided residential care. Stevie and several others with disabilities lived happily in a house with Sangroula and Sangroula’s family. The young man would come home to Unity every other weekend and on holidays. The family loved Sangroula.
When the Sangroulas moved to Virginia, however, PathWays needed to find a new live-in caregiver. With Stevie’s behavioral issues and need for constant supervision, Weidlich said he was under no illusions about just how challenging that would be.
For a while, Stevie bounced among temporary caretakers until PathWays found him a more permanent home with Onkundi in Allenstown in October 2021.
Stephen Weidlich Sr. served in the army during the Persian Gulf War, something his son always admired about him. Stevie, who made this art project for his father, wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps and join the military himself. Crystal Weidlich, his stepmother, said: “He’d always joke, ‘They’re gonna build me a mecha-suit so I can walk and fight.’”
‘A lack of consequences’

The state investigation from the Bureau of Adult and Aging Services concluded that Onkundi had committed neglect. However, the bureau didn’t finalize that finding until November 2024, nearly two years after Stevie’s death. Onkundi is now legally ineligible to be a caregiver of people with disabilities, but in the nearly two years between Stevie’s death and that finding, he would’ve been legally permitted to work for PathWays or another agency. It’s unclear whether he did so. Onkundi did not answer the Bulletin’s phone calls, voicemails, or text messages.
PathWays didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview or comment. 
No criminal charges have been filed against Onkundi and the Attorney General’s Office concluded its investigation into Onkundi, the office told the Bulletin. The case has been kicked back down to the Allenstown Police Department, which doesn’t have legal authority to file manslaughter or murder charges but does have authority for lesser offenses. The Attorney General’s Office refused to answer the Bulletin’s questions about the case because the investigation is ongoing at the local level.

“Investigations of this nature can take time and may move between local law enforcement, county prosecutors, and this office depending on the circumstances,” Michael Garrity, director of communications for the Department of Justice, wrote in an email. “Investigating agencies cannot rush to judgment, but follow the evidence and the facts wherever they lead. Any prosecution must be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That standard is imposed on us by the law and professional ethics.”
Weidlich and Stevie’s stepmother, Crystal, now feel left in the dark. 
When he learned there would be no murder or manslaughter charges, Weidlich was angry. Allenstown police seemed serious about the investigation and kept them updated early on, he said, but as the attorney general got involved and time passed, they heard less and less. Still, he’s holding out hope that Allenstown police will file some sort of charges.
In the meantime, Weidlich has filed a lawsuit against PathWays and Onkundi, among others.
There were other apparent lapses in oversight, too.
The Incapacitated and Vulnerable Adult Fatality Review Committee is a board of experts established through state law to review concerning deaths of vulnerable or incapacitated people, evaluating if there were any failures in state policy or practices that led to the death. The board then makes recommendations on how to prevent future similar deaths.

Both co-chairs of that committee, Vanessa Blais and Francesca Broderick, told the Bulletin Stevie’s death was never brought before the committee. Agencies like the Bureau of Aging and Adult Services and Department of Health and Human Services — which both knew of the death and have representatives on the committee — aren’t legally obligated to report deaths to the committee. They’re merely encouraged. Still, when the Bulletin told her about Stevie’s death, Blais said she was shocked it hadn’t been brought to her committee.
Attorneys Kristin Ross and Cristina Rousseau, who are representing Weidlich in his lawsuit and have represented multiple families in this system, said tragedies like Stevie’s are symptomatic of a broken system.
“Really what we see is a lack of accountability and a lack of consequences when things go wrong within the area agency system, and frankly I think that starts at the top,” Ross said. “There are regulations that are supposed to be being followed, but what we find is they’re not, and there’s no consequences, and there’s a very laissez-faire attitude about the fact that they’re not being followed.”
Cristina Rousseau
In Stevie’s case, Rousseau noted the entire investigation focused on Onkundi.
“But you know what has never happened in any of the cases we’ve been involved (with)?” Rousseau said. “The area agencies are not investigated. They are the ones that have all of these duties, and when it comes to violations that have occurred, nobody looks at PathWays.”
Rousseau and Ross also point to what they consider a perverse financial incentive within the system of care.
“Something that we’ve seen is a pushback against allowing immediate family members to become the approved in-home care providers,” Ross said. “And instead a push towards individuals outside of the family.”
Agencies and caregivers earn significantly more money providing residential care than day services. According to PathWays’ contract with Onkundi, acquired by the Bulletin, Onkundi was paid more than $5,000 per month and more than $62,000 annually to care for Stevie. Had he been providing day services, he would’ve been paid about $1,400 a month and $17,000 annually, according to the contract.

“Everyone is always so concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse,” Ross said. “We are literally giving the state evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse within our very own state agency system, and nobody’s doing anything about it.”
Rousseau said the absence of state action is perplexing.
Kristin Ross
“You would think that somebody in the state would maybe want to take a look at this,” she said. “But they don’t even look at it. They just continue to pay and engage and give contracts to these area agencies after these issues have come to light. … The fact a civil lawsuit ends up being the vehicle to get answers for a family whose son died and froze to death in the care of somebody approved by the state tells me we are dealing with an incredibly broken, broken system.”
Before Stevie went to live with Onkundi, he told a case manager some of his hopes for the future, all of which were outlined in the service agreement as things for him to work toward with the help of his care team. He wanted a job, his own apartment near his family, and a romantic relationship one day.
 “You know, he wanted to have a girlfriend,” his father said. “He wanted a normal life.”

The Senate votes Thursday. If all goes as planned, the legislature will put four bills on the desk of Gov. Ned Lamont by Friday, setting the stage for the Democrat to formally launch his campaign for a third term with a degree of momentum, if not without challenges to address in the regular session in February.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Tuesday he will open the session with a debate on the revised version of House Bill 5002, an omnibus housing bill Lamont unexpectedly vetoed in June after the regular session, siding with Republican opponents and infuriating Democratic supporters.
“It will start bumpy, and it will land more smoothly,” Ritter said of the day. He noted that any measure pressuring suburbs to allow more multi-family housing “remains kind of an issue that divides the parties, frankly, in our chamber.” No Republican voted for H.B. 5002.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, forecasted more than a little turbulence, as did Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
“I think tomorrow is going to be a barn burner,” Candelora said Tuesday. “It is one thing to go into session to address a potential emergency — and that being the federal shutdown and the loss of programs that impact Connecticut residents. And I think that Republicans stepped to the plate to meet that moment and to help our residents. It’s a whole other thing to start pushing agenda items that not only aren’t emergent in nature, but I think were already hotly contested in the regular session.”
The special session coincides with the U.S. House returning to Washington after nearly a two-month absence to vote on reopening the federal government, a step that takes away the sense of urgency, at least among Republicans, to empower the governor to subsidize federal hunger, nutrition and home heating programs.
Despite opposition by President Donald J. Trump to states offering alternative funding during the shutdown, leaders of the Republican minorities in the General Assembly had voiced support for giving Lamont authority to spend state funds for SNAP and WIC food assistance and LIHEAP heating funding.
“I don’t think you’re going to get as much bipartisan support on this funding now that the shutdown is ending and SNAP is restored,” Harding said.
Prior to the shutdown, Democrats had urged the governor to call a special session to increase state budget reserves in anticipation of needing to meet federal cuts that were passed in July in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but will not be felt fully until after the midterm elections in 2026.
One of the bills up for a vote Wednesday will give the governor emergency authority to exceed the spending cap and raise the ceiling on the state’s rainy day fund by $500 million. It now has $4.3 billion, the maximum allowed by the statutory limit of 18% of the general fund.
With the shutdown in mind, the bill gives Lamont authority to draw from the budget reserves within certain parameters until the regular session begins on Feb. 4.
“Look, the $500 million is a safety net. ‘On again, off again.’ You never knew what the federal government was doing,” Lamont said. “That was loud and clear when it came to SNAP. We had six different directives in seven different days. Maybe they’re going to solve the shutdown over the next 48 hours. Little less need for the $500 million at that point, but at least we have the backstop if we need it.”
Decisions on how to use the $500 million most likely won’t be made until the regular session. 
Even if federal funding of SNAP is restored, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act tightened the eligibility requirements, most likely denying about 10% of the 366,000 recipients aid over the next three months. A more expensive loss to address are expiring subsidies that make health insurance affordable on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.
Those could cost $350 million annually, Ritter said at a press conference Monday.
“So, you got to be more careful about the Big Beautiful Bill cuts, but we’re going to make sure that nobody vulnerable gets left behind,” Lamont said Tuesday after a press conference at Waterbury Hospital.

A third bill scheduled for a vote Wednesday would enable UConn Health to purchase and make improvements at Waterbury Hospital, then operate it under a public private partnership. The fourth bill was a legislative catch-all, with provisions on childhood mental health, a funding mechanism for a cancer fund, and limits on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can operate around courthouses and access health data.
The immigration measure is expected to get pushback from Republicans, who have accused Democrats of hindering federal law enforcement operations.
Lamont and Comptroller Sean Scanlon, who helped negotiate the Waterbury deal, said the state must do more to stabilize affordable health care.
With Lamont’s support, Scanlon has been working on a public health insurance option, reviving an effort Scanlon first made as a state lawmaker in 2019. The governor and comptroller promise to roll out details in the near future, most likely with an eye towards legislative action next year.
“There’s two prongs in health care right now: The cost of delivering it costs too much, and the insurance that covers that care is covering too little,” Scanlon said. “And the small group market that helps a lot of people insure, that is dying. And so I think what the governor’s strategy is going forward is a multi-pronged approach to make sure that everyone in Connecticut has access to care through affordable insurance, and that everyone that goes to use that insurance can get affordable, low cost, but high quality care.”
Candelora complained Tuesday that lawmakers would be returning to Hartford on Wednesday without seeing fully vetted legislation. Lamont and Democratic lawmakers released a summary of the housing bill on Friday.
He objected to a provision that would allow housing to be built as of right in commercial zones.
“You know, local zoning is there for a reason, but we are prioritizing housing over commercial needs that help support a tax base, but also enhance the quality of communities,” Candelora said.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said the revised bill allows for greater influence than the original over housing that could go in commercial zones.
“We did it with parameters” suggested by local officials, Rojas said. One change, he said, is that housing can be built as a right in commercial zones, but not as a conversion of existing commercial buildings.
In vetoing the original bill, that was one of the provisions Lamont had applauded.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) Five hundred in Ogunquit, another 700 in Damariscotta and Portland, and a packed theater in Bath last week. Despite a running list of foul-mouthed controversies and staffing defections, Graham Platner is still drawing crowds — and Maine’s political establishment needs to recognize why.
It’s possible that voters have more tolerance for bigotry — or at least bigoted language — in a predominantly white, rural state. But I don’t think that is what is going on here, and the impulse among outsiders to dismiss Platner’s popularity this way ignores a much more urgent dynamic that captures how many voters are feeling right now: fed up.
To recap, in Platner’s most publicized comments, made in Reddit forums spanning nearly a decade — reported in local and national outlets days after Democratic Party-favorite Maine Gov. Janet Mills entered the race — he’s been shown to dismiss military sexual assaults, question Black patrons’ tipping habits, demean LGBTQ+ people, and criticize police officers and rural Americans, while advocating for the potential need to take up arms against facism. 
And there’s the question of the tattoo, which he said he got in 2007 while partying with fellow Marines overseas, and the ongoing ambiguity over when he realized it closely resembled a Totenkopf, the symbol of the Nazi Schutzstaffel, or SS, police unit. 
For many, these symbols and statements are beyond the pale and underscore how little is known about the man who does not have a political record to lean on when making the case that those views do not represent the person he is today.
But reporting on thousands of other comments that Platner made between July 2009 and November 2021 paints a more complex picture.
In the posts, the oyster farmer coarsely rails against racism, facism, American imperialism and the political establishment. 
He said homophobia is “indefensible” and described the military’s discriminatory treatment of same-sex spouses as “pretty goddamn disgusting.” According to socialist magazine Jacobin, he blasted a Republican U.S. House candidate for saying that police will only shoot a Black person who “needs to be shot,” calling him a “racist motherf***er,” and complained that no one cared about handgun violence because “nobody really gives a sh*t about things until it’s well spoken white kids getting hurt.”
There are many such examples.
‘Washington need not apply:’ How Mainers are evaluating controversy-laden Graham Platner

And for many Mainers, who are not just reading mainstream political coverage of the old posts but who are listening to his speeches and statements today, they have an alternative view of Platner, and it is one they have decided they can still get behind.
“I needed to question this notion of: Is he authentic or not?” South Portland resident Frank Smith recently told reporter Emma Davis. “When I heard his responses, I mean, he owned what happened. He dealt with it honestly. He didn’t misdirect or obfuscate, and I think that says a tremendous amount for an individual, especially politicians.”
For Platner’s fans, these events have become part of a narrative, in which a regular (ie. white, straight) American Joe sacrificed himself for his nation and came home broken and disaffected; who gradually healed with the help of community, connection and Veterans Affairs benefits, and is now taking on the establishment, which is bent on destroying him.
His candidacy does not fit in a very tidy box, but it is telling that many of his supporters find his past statements abhorrent and still prefer him to the Democratic Party status quo.
A look at Janet Mills
In an Oct. 20 social media post, community organizer Safiya Khalid highlighted why she is sticking with Platner, articulating a theme I’ve seen voiced repeatedly — that his popularity has almost as much to do with Mills as it does with him.
“The truth is the bar in politics has been set low for a long time, not because of new candidates like Graham but because those already in power keep failing to deliver real change,” wrote Khalid, who in 2019 was the first Somali-American elected to the Lewiston City Council and later stepped away from politics due to racist comments she was subject to both during her campaign and later from within her own party. 
“I am choosing to support someone who is not part of the same political machine, someone who might not be perfect but is willing to fight for something different,” she said. “Maine deserves new energy, real accountability, and a leader who actually listens.”
Mills, whose record includes many mainstream bonafides like fighting for abortion rights and expanding health care access, gained national prominence for taking on the Trump administration over its attacks on transgender students. But a closer look at her policies reveals how time and again she angered many Democratic voters.
Khalid pointed specifically to the governor’s 2021 veto of a bill that would have closed the Long Creek Youth Development Center, the state’s last youth prison, as well as more recent actions such as postponing her decision on a bill that would restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, and coming out against a ballot referendum to institute a red flag law, which ultimately passed last week with 62% of the vote.
But Mills has blocked even more popular proposals, such as legislation to restore tribal sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations, not just breaking from Democrats but a growing bipartisan consensus that it’s “the right f***ing thing to do,” as Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Troy Jackson put it.










I am choosing to support someone who is not part of the same political machine, someone who might not be perfect but is willing to fight for something different.


– Safiya Khalid


The governor has also vetoed more than a half dozen bills that would improve labor standards — including multiple efforts to include farmworkers in the state minimum wage, a measure that finally passed this spring — which is likely what drove labor groups to recruit Platner to run against her.
Mills also axed several proposals to reform the state’s criminal code at a time when the public defense system is in crisis and hundreds of low-income Mainers are being held in jail without representation.
In a recent column about Platner, Shay Stewart Bouley, a writer and former elected official who runs a Boston-based racial justice organization (and who has written for Maine Morning Star), wrote that while his comments “are bad, racism is ultimately about power and privilege that favors white people and exploits and oppresses Black folks and other people of color.” She notes that Mills “has an actual track record when it comes to communities of color and marginalized folks … that is far less than stellar.”

Even the issue that propelled Mills into the national consciousness, transgender rights, the governor argued was more about states’ rights and later said Maine’s policy allowing trans girls to compete in girls’ sports was “worthy of debate” — not exactly a ride-or-die pronouncement.
Mills has built her Senate campaign around her record of standing up to President Donald Trump, the accomplishments of her two terms in the Blaine House, and her ability to win a statewide race — something only four other Democrats have done in the past 50 years. No small potatoes. 
But, she’s only managed to issue milquetoast critiques of U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican and her actual opponent in the race, and doesn’t have much to say about the broader system or structures that enabled this moment.
And then there is the issue of age. Mills is a septuagenarian and, if elected, would be the oldest incoming freshman senator in history. And while no one is questioning her ability to lead, she represents an era of politicians seen as out of touch at best and, at worst, complicit in defending the status quo that helped propel Trump to power.
“I’d like to see politics more in the hands of younger generations of people,” Bill DeLong of Biddeford told Davis. “It’s not working right now.”
‘A new kind of politics’?
Regardless of your political leanings, it has been a tough few years for the vast majority of Americans, and I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that there is an absence of hope. 
It is in that void that Platner has been able to flourish. With a platform focused on ending the influence of money in politics, enacting Medicare for All, increasing taxes on billionaires, passing federal anti-discrimination legislation, developing federal child care policy, implementing congressional term limits, taking on Pentagon waste and corruption and ending “pointless” wars including what he described as the genocide in Gaza, among other positions, he’s struck a nerve with young people and other voters who have felt ignored by leaders of both dominant parties.
“Everyone in Maine — Republican or Democrat, Trump supporter or progressive — when you walk around this state, you ask any working person in the state, ‘Do you think that you live in a system — a political system, an economic system — that has your best interest at heart?’ Nobody says yes to that,” Platner told the crowd during an October town hall event in Collins’ hometown Caribou. 
Another Senate candidate drops out to endorse Mills as Platner controversies stack up

Platner has said he wants to build a movement that can help organize people around a “new kind of politics.” And he’s painted himself as the former Marine who can take a beating from the powers that be to help usher in that era of change.
Much to the chagrin of national Democratic leaders looking to pick up Maine’s Senate seat in the midterm elections, the primary is proving to be a bigger headache than they likely anticipated. But it is the same dynamic playing out across the country, with voters on the left increasingly dissatisfied with the same old playbook and the same old people.
For Mainers, the Senate primary race cuts too close to other elections in recent memory where it felt as if an invisible force was pushing back against the tide of popular sentiment, such as President Joe Biden’s attempt at reelection in 2024, or former Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon’s failed bid to oust Collins in 2020, or even Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders — who won the state’s 2016 Democratic presidential caucus by a landslide. Maine voters are sick of being told who to vote for.
There are others in the race, namely former congressional aide Jordan Wood, but state leaders shouldn’t have been so quick to clear the field for Mills, leaving voters with a choice primarily between someone with too much baggage and too little experience, and someone they see as having helped build the system they are now buckling under.
Platner has said this campaign “is not just about beating Susan Collins” or “flipping the Senate back to a Democratic side,” but rather “it is about building in the state of Maine an organized working class power that we have not seen in generations.”
Whatever happens with the campaign, it seems that his candidacy has already given voice to some deep frustrations among voters. Leaders would be wise to listen.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)The United States was founded on the idea that government exists to serve its people. To do this, government must deliver services that promote the common good. When the government shuts down, it fails to meet its fundamental purpose.
While government shutdowns are not new in the U.S., most have lasted less than a week. At 40 days, the current shutdown may well be on the way to an end this week, as enough Senate Democratic caucus members have voted with Republicans on a measure to reopen the government. But it will remain the longest in the history of the nation.
When the government shuts down for such a long time, it inflicts hardships, anxieties and irritations on its citizens. You might wonder why elected officials allow lengthy disruptions to happen.
It is common to blame the politicians for the shutdown. However, as a philosopher who researches democracy, I think the fault lies also with us, the citizens. In a democracy, we generally get the politics we ask for, and the electorate has developed a taste for political spectacle over competent leadership.
American democracy has grown increasingly tribal, leading us to become more invested in punishing our partisan rivals than in demanding competent government. We are infatuated with the spectacle of our side dominating the other.
Understandably, politicians have embraced obstruction. They have learned that deadlock can pay, because they have the support of their voters in behaving this way. Politics is no longer about representation and policy, it’s now about vanquishing and even humiliating the other side.
 
More fervent, not better informed
To see this, we must examine polarization. Let’s start by distinguishing two kinds of polarization.
First is political polarization. It measures the divide between the U.S.’s two major parties. When political polarization is severe, the common ground among the parties falls away. This naturally undermines cooperation. That Republicans and Democrats are politically polarized is certainly part of the explanation for the shutdown.
But that’s not the entire story. As I argue in my book “Civic Solitude,” the deeper trouble has to do with belief polarization.
Unlike political polarization, which measures the distance between opposing groups, belief polarization occurs within a single group. In belief polarization, like-minded people transform into more extreme version of themselves: Liberals become more liberal, conservatives become more conservative, Second Amendment advocates become more pro-gun, environmentalists become more green, and so on.
Importantly, this shift is driven by the desire to fit in with one’s peers, not by evidence or reason. Hence, we become more fervent but no better informed.
Additionally, our more extreme selves are also more tribal and conformist. As we shift, we become more antagonistic toward outsiders. We also become more insistent on uniformity within our group, less tolerant of differences.
 
Animosity and obstruction
The combination of intensifying antagonism toward those on the “other side” and escalating cohesion among those on “your side” turns all aspects of life into politics.
In the U.S. today, liberals and conservatives are heavily socially segregated. They live in different neighborhoods, work in different professions, vacation in different locations, drive different vehicles and shop in different stores. Everyday behavior has become an extension of partisan affiliation.
Ironically, as everyday life becomes politically saturated, politics itself becomes more about lifestyle and less about policy. Research suggests that while animosity across the parties has intensified significantly, citizens’ disagreements over policy have either remained stable or eased. We dislike one another more intensely yet are not more divided.
This paints a grim portrait of U.S. democracy. Note that this condition incentivizes politicians to amplify their contempt for political rivals. Politicians seek to win elections, and stoking negative feelings such as fear and indignation are potent triggers of political behavior, including voting.
Consequently, when citizens are belief-polarized, animosity and obstruction become winning electoral strategies. Meanwhile, politicians are released from the task of serving the common good.
 
Channeling contempt

It is no surprise that discussions of the shutdown have consistently focused on blame.
The Republicans, who hold the congressional majority, have sought to score points by depicting the shutdown as the Democrats’ fault. Several official websites maintained by the federal government included statements denouncing the shutdown as strictly the doing of the Democrats. Their aim has been to channel citizens’ frustration into contempt for the Democratic Party.
At the beginning of the shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed that there was “literally nothing to negotiate” with congressional Democrats.
But there’s the rub. Democratic government is fundamentally a matter of negotiation. Neither winning an election nor being a member of the majority party means that you can simply call the shots. The constitutional procedures by which our representatives govern are designed to force cooperation, collaboration and compromise.
Thanks to polarization, however, these noble ideals of political give-and-take have dissolved. Cooperation is now seen as surrender to political enemies. That’s very clear in many Democrats’ outraged reactions to the eight senators from their caucus who have now voted with Republicans to end the shutdown.
Meanwhile, more than 1 million government employees haven’t been paid, many crucial government services have been interrupted, diminished or suspended, and, with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, travelers are experiencing flight disruptions. While there may be an end to the shutdown on the near horizon, any deal could simply postpone crucial policy debates and could well end in another shutdown in the new year.
The key to avoiding this kind of failure is to become a citizenry that demands competent government over partisan domination.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)If Ohio was a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump World, faithfully executing the corrupt orders of an unforgiving boss, would Ohioans even blink an eye? 
Trumpian taskmasters in the Ohio Statehouse already execute public policy based on the dictates of the MAGA king. So, what is the difference? 
Unquestioning obedience to the convicted felon drove Ohio Republicans (with obliging Democrats) to intensify congressional district manipulation and give Trump the gerrymandered advantage he demanded ahead of the 2026 elections. 
The boss also ordered red states to make it harder for voters to cast ballots in the midterms. Less turnout is less threatening. Trump fears the results of a referendum on his regime. 
The Ohio Senate is in his corner. 
State Sen. Theresa Gavarone, as usual, leads the anti-voter brigade on the pretense of election integrity. 
She doesn’t even come up with new excuses to erect barriers to voting anymore. 
The Bowling Green Republican, behind one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country, longs to get on right-wing radar by going more extreme than MAGA Republicans in Congress to disenfranchise voters with made-up election fraud remedies unsupported by evidence.  
Last week, the Ohio Senate passed one of Gavarone’s bills in record time. But Ohio Senate Bill 293 was a rush order from Trump World. 
It came with an explicit warning: get rid of mail-in voting or risk the wrath of Trump’s Department of Justice in court. 
The only U.S. president who conspired to overturn an election he lost, with lies about widespread mail ballot fraud, is laying the groundwork to delegitimize another election with the same fantastical and false claims about vote-by-mail fraud. 
He is again sowing baseless doubts about secure mail-in voting systems used by nearly 1 in 3 Americans in 2024. 
All it took for Ohio Senate Republicans to go along was a little federal pressure/extortion. 
For no compelling reason, they voted to stop counting legitimate mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day in Trump-friendly legislation that mirrored his legally shaky executive order in March. 
The EO decreed ballots received post-election invalid and commanded voters produce birth certificates or passports as proof of eligibility — to create unwarranted obstacles for millions of Americans who simply want to vote. 
Gavarone co-sponsored correlating legislation, Ohio Senate Bill 153, to impose the same burden on Ohioans. 
It appears to be on the fast track for passage. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meanwhile, Ohio Senate Bill 293 is headed to the Ohio House to become another voter suppression law in the state. 
It would arbitrarily eliminate the mail-in ballot “grace period” in Ohio and cause legal ballots to be thrown out. 
But the eminently absurd Gavarone insisted, “we want all valid votes to count, and the process needs to be done on Election Day” or we will turn into pumpkins at the close of polls. 
Republican lawmakers who previously shortened the deadline (from 10 to four days) in which those late-arriving ballots, postmarked by Election Day, were counted now embrace Trump’s edict not to process any ballot received past Election Day — lest unchecked power be checked by incoming ballots. 
In 2024, almost 10,000 mail-in ballots from eligible Ohio voters arrived in the four-day window that would be eliminated in SB 293. 
That’s 10,000 citizens, enough to flip a race, summarily disenfranchised. 
Tough luck if you’re a registered voter in good standing, particularly one who is elderly or disabled or lives in rural areas, and postal delays beyond your control cancel your vote. 
It’s crazy. Over a million Ohioans used mail-in ballots to vote in the last presidential election. That’s about 17% of the nearly 5,900,000 votes cast. 
More registered Republicans voted by mail in Ohio in 2024, than Democrats did. 
Voters 65 and older, Ohio’s biggest age demographic, were far and away the biggest users of mail-in voting, returning roughly 520,000 ballots by mail a year ago. 
Why not vote from the convenience of home and bypass lines at the polls? 
Voting by mail, which surged to record rates in the 2020 election, is still pretty popular and a majority of Americans favor allowing the option to make it safer, easier and more reliable for people to cast ballots. 
They don’t buy Trump’s ravings about mail voting fraud which, in truth, is exceedingly rare. 
But after Democratic victories in off-year elections last week Trump again railed baselessly about “rigged” mail voting and called on congressional Republicans to ban it outright “except for military, far away military, and people that are very sick.”  
He is seeding the ground for rejection of midterm election results he doesn’t like in a throwback to 2020. 
We’ve seen this movie before. 
Ohioans should know the part their Statehouse politicians are playing in the Trump sequel, how they dutifully execute legislative assaults on voting rights (or else) to enable rule by fiat not the ballot box.
So is the Statehouse is working for Trump World instead of us? 
Mia Lewis, of Common Cause Ohio, asked Trumpian taskmasters directly in recent testimony against SB 293. 
“Senator Gavarone often asks, ‘Isn’t even just one instance of fraudulent vote too many?’ Of course. It could theoretically skew the result. Luckily, this is so vanishingly rare it has not had and could not have had any impact. But if someone who is eligible to vote — who wants to vote, does everything legally to vote — if they have their voted ballot cast aside uncounted, isn’t that too many, Senator Gavarone?”

The first vehicle in Storrs was a 4.5-horsepower Mobile Steamer, driven in 1904 by a mechanical arts instructor at the nascent Connecticut Agricultural College. Within an hour of parking on campus, he’d already received a citation.
The second sentence is, of course, completely false – but given the sensitivities surrounding parking on college campuses, maybe you paused for a moment and entertained that it might contain a nugget of truth.
That’s OK. Parking permits and enforcement on the University of Connecticut’s campuses isn’t the stuff of groundbreaking scientific research, high graduation rates, or championship athletic banners. But it’s a necessary piece of the puzzle that helps UConn achieve those and other goals, and an obligation we approach in the spirit of ensuring fairness amid space constraints.
A recent op-ed in this publication expressed opinions about the process as it relates to commuter students, calling it “punitive and costly” and “an important revenue source” for the university.
Let’s break down the revenues. UConn Parking Services is self-supporting, with its operations funded solely by permit sales, event parking fees, and citation payments. It doesn’t draw from tuition or state funds, and has no impact on academic operations, deficit mitigation, or other parts of the university budget.
However, it does move the needle in a notable way: Net proceeds are transferred annually to the university specifically to help fund financial aid, to the tune of more than $500,000 in a typical fiscal year. Many millions of dollars have been paid to UConn over the years, and in turn allocated to needy students through their financial aid packages.
Gross proceeds from citations, permits, and event parking fees go directly to operation and maintenance of the parking system and repayment of the UConn 2000 bonded debt used to build the South Garage.
In terms of fairness, parking enforcement is necessary to help ensure that UConn’s students, faculty, and staff have access to the spaces for which they bought permits. People who either park without permits or repeatedly violate the rules are taking spaces away from those who reasonably expect to use them.
None of this is to say we’re not sympathetic to the stresses of our students, of course, given the classes, work obligations, and other duties that so many of them juggle. In fact, to encourage voluntary compliance, thousands of the citations issued each year are warnings that carry no fines.
The new “boot” wheel immobilizer deployed this year at Storrs has also received attention, but it’s simply a helpful way of addressing cases when a driver has allowed more than $200 in fines to accrue.
Even then, the driver can simply and immediately pay by phone or online, receive a code to release the boot, and be on their way within minutes with directions to return the boot to a drop box open around the clock.
People who receive citations can also file appeals online, in person, or by mail – and if they are denied, they can appeal that denial if additional facts are available that might be pertinent.
We also work closely with our partners in the Windham Region Transit District regarding on-campus and regional bus availability; with the state Department of Transportation for the U-Pass that lets students ride its public transportation services without fares; and with UConn Police in their efforts to help ensure the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists, and scooter users.
A lot has changed since 1904, when Professor J.N. Fitts introduced the automobile to Storrs.
About 13,000 parking spaces are now on campus, with about 85% of them in use during peak periods. Since that demand can be unevenly distributed across campus, we recently launched the new Modii Smart Parking Finder on our website.
Simply put: It’s very reasonable for students, faculty, and staff with permits to expect access to one of those spaces. But to help make that happen, it’s necessary for UConn to consistently enforce parking rules, getting non-complaint vehicles moving so permit-holders get what they’re paying for.

In a YouGov poll of Connecticut votes released on Nov. 6 , acting to solve the housing crisis with real solutions was found to carry with it are likely to receive a 30 point net favorability boost. In other words, voters are watching Connecticut fail to act on the boiling housing crisis, and (when given the choice), they are voting for leaders who will.
In case you missed it, Connecticut just had an election. While there was much focus on some larger races that flipped seats, let me focus on just a few smaller races that prove this poll result is worth more than the paper it is written on:

In Fairfield, a town artificially divided over several controversial 8-30g projects, voters decisively backed a pro-housing slate for the Planning and Zoning Commission. The result flipped the board to a Democratic majority and ousted noted NIMBY activist Alexis Harrison, who has long denied the obvious truth: Connecticut has a shortage of homes.
In Newington, the recently re-elected mayor was accosted while door knocking to do something to improve the housing shortage. Newington has for decades been a “build nothing, deny everything” kind of town. That is no longer politically palatable.
Manchester: Mayor Jay Moran was just re-elected with 70% of the vote. Why? He has a vision for more housing and a better safer Main Street. A small faction of residents want to cling to the past, have launched petitions, lawsuits, public pressure campaign. And through it all Mayor Moran has not backed down, rather he has stood firm in his vision of a better future and is widely admired for it.

This dynamic extends far beyond Connecticut:

In New York City, voters approved three ballot measures to speed permitting and construction of new housing.
In Cambridge, MA, the city council passed a significant reimagination of their city’s zoning in early 2025 to welcome new housing and provide a price relief valve. This election, seven incumbents who passed that reform were re-elected with the vice mayor, the primary champion of that reform receiving the most votes. One of the challengers just elected was a recent college grad who ran on going even further on addressing the housing crisis.
In Salem, MA all seven candidates who ran on a platform of housing affordability were elected, including 5 first time candidates. This is after the city recently abolished parking mandates for new residential buildings just a few weeks before the election
Famously anti-development Marin County, CA has a housing zoning ballot measure leading in early vote counting.

There are hundreds of other examples across the country of exactly this dynamic. Politicians who care about housing affordability, housing choice, and can not only articulate it well but act on those beliefs are widely lauded and rewarded with electoral landslides.
I remain struck by a speech recently given by the Governor of North Dakota, Kelly Armstrong at the YIMBYtown conference held in New Haven. There he said, and let me paraphrase: There is a difference between a political discomfort and a political liability. Sure you might get yelled at but society doesn’t work without there being enough housing. You just need to state clearly why it is necessary and pursue it.

A commission studying the possibility of changes in Maryland held its first hearing Tuesday. (Screenshot)The first meeting of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission on Tuesday was short and to the point — if the point was that there are still a lot of questions surrounding the commission’s work and not much time to answer them.
The five-member commission met virtually for a little over a half-hour in an organizational meeting that included almost 20 minutes of a primer on the Census from Maryland Department of Planning officials.
They spoke in general about shifts in state population from the 2010 to the 2020 Census, and the changes since then in annual Census surveys — although Planning Deputy Secretary Kristin Fleckenstein said the newer numbers cannot be used for redistricting. Any redrawing of congressional boundaries would have to be based on the actual 2020 Census numbers, the same data that was used for last redistricting, in 2022.
Most of the rest of the commission’s brief meeting was spent discussing the number and format of meetings, with Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), a commission member, asking if the panel planned in-person meetings and how many. He noted that the last redistricting commission, in 2021, was required to “go to all parts of the state to maintain … constitutional validity.”
U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), the commission chair, said meetings for now would be virtual, with people given the opportunity to testify, while the commission worked to secure locations for in-person meetings if necessary. Alsobrooks said she hopes to get in two more meetings before Thanksgiving, including one scheduled for 4:30 p.m. this Friday.
In this first round of hearings, Alsobrooks said, the commission is just planning to listen to voters to see how they want the state to proceed with redistricting, if they want it it to proceed at all..
Moore defends redistricting as effort to ensure fairness; Republicans prepare to go to court

“Working together over the next month or so, we’re going to listen to Marylanders from across the state on whether Maryland should redraw its congressional lines, and what that map would look like,” she said at the outset of the meeting.
Without setting a specific timeline, or other hearing dates, Alsobrooks said she hoped the commission could work “quickly, to give the governor and the legislature the time they need to should they choose to draw new lines.”
The panel will have to work quickly: The General Assembly convenes two months from Friday, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays to work around in that time.
Alsobrooks said the commission would decide Friday how many in-person meetings will be held. Those meetings, she said, will be to “solicit feedback from Marylanders regarding whether or not they want this redistricting to happen.”
Both Alsobrooks and Fleckenstein said there are no proposed new congressional maps for people to respond to, that any such documents would not come until it’s been decided that redistricting is the way to go.
That is far from a settled question among lawmakers, who would have to approve any new district maps.
Redistricting is typically done ever 10 years, after the decennial census, when the number of seats in Congress is redistributed among the states based on their populations, and the states redraw districts to reflect population shifts within their states.
That tradition was upended this year when Texas, at the urging of President Donald Trump, redistricted midcycle to create a map that is expected to give Republicans five more seats in Congress after the 2026 elections. Other states soon followed suit, both Republican and Democratic, with pressure from the national parties for states to get on board.
Some Maryland lawmakers have talked about redistricting since earlier this year, when Texas made its move. But Gov. Wes Moore made it official last week, when he appointed the commission to study whether Maryland’s congressional maps are fair — acknowledging that he was motivated in part by the “attack on our democracy” by the GOP redistrictings.
In Maryland, there is little to gain for Democrats, who already hold seven of the state’s eight House seats. That has been pointed out by critic, who say the state has much more to lose if its redistricting plans are rejected by a court or if the new boundaries weaken any of the seven seats that Democrats now hold. That could result in the party actually losing seats to the GOP, critics say.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One of those critics is Ferguson, who circulated a letter recently on behalf of his 34-member Democratic caucus saying it was opposed to a mid-decade redistricting. But Moore and supporters have vowed to press on.
Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, the only Republican member of the commission, asked at the end of Tuesday’s meeting what exactly was broken with the districts that needs to be fixed.
“Has anybody stated what the actual problem is that we’re looking to fix?” he asked. “I’m all in here, but I’m trying to figure out what the problem is.”
Alsobrooks said that’s the goal of the first round of meetings, to hear from Marylanders who will look at the current maps and weigh in on the current configuration of maps.

Negotiations among California and the six other basin states now will continue into next year, as Arizona ramps up the rhetoric, demanding a firmer federal hand in the talks.","In summary
The federal government often makes deadlines on the Colorado River, but — in recent years — rarely has enforced them. Negotiations among California and the six other basin states now will continue into next year, as Arizona ramps up the rhetoric, demanding a firmer federal hand in the talks. 


After two fraught years of negotiations amid dire projections for the Colorado River’s reservoirs, California and six other states that rely on the river’s water have yet again failed to reach a deal — despite a federal deadline. 
“While more work needs to be done, collective progress has been made that warrants continued efforts to define and approve details for a finalized agreement,” the states said. The written statement released Tuesday included no details about how they plan to manage the river after the current rulebook expires at the end of next year. 
Officials at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the federal stewards for the river under the Department of the Interior, have threatened to impose their own plan in the absence of a deal. 
“Two years. And the lack of progress, in light of how perilous the conditions are on the Colorado — it’s unacceptable,” said Mark Gold, former director of Water Scarcity Solutions at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a board member of the Southern California water import giant, the Metropolitan Water District. 
The federal government frequently sets deadlines on the Colorado River, but it almost never enforces them. 
Negotiations now continue in advance of another, February deadline for a seven-state deal. Scott Cameron, acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, said in June that the goal is to “parachute” the states’ agreement into the ongoing federal planning process, in time to finalize a plan by May or June next year. 
Yet the states remain deadlocked even as the agreements that currently govern the river near expiration. 
Elizabeth Koebele, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, suspects that relationships between the states have become too fractured, and water too scarce, for deadlines to effectively motivate the warring states.  
“We have less water, and it’s caused more rippling problems,” Koebele told CalMatters. “You’re cutting a smaller pie, for more people.” 
Federal pressure or state collaboration?
A major conflict has been over how much each basin must cut back their use of the overtapped river, to close the ever-growing gap between dwindling supply and ravenous demand. 
California, Arizona, and Nevada in the lower basin offered in March 2024 to cut their use by up to 1.5 million acre-feet of water per year, depending on reservoir conditions. They urged Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico upstream to share any belt-tightening beyond that, but the upstream states balked — saying that their water users must already conserve water when dry conditions shrink the river’s flows. 
Becky Mitchell, Colorado’s Upper Colorado River Commissioner, said that the states “remain committed to collaboration grounded in the best available science and respect for all Colorado River water users. We are taking a meaningful step toward long-term sustainability and demonstrating a shared determination to find supply-driven solutions.”
But Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has pressed the Trump administration to be more forceful in state negotiations. In a letter Tuesday to Trump’s Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Hobbs and Arizona legislative leaders called the upstream states’ negotiating position “extreme.” 
“We find it alarming that the Upper Basin States have repeatedly refused to implement any volume of binding, verifiable water supply reductions,” the letter said. 
Experts say there’s no time to waste; even the time it takes to develop a new plan for the river may be too long for its dwindling reservoirs. The Colorado River basin is suffering a climate change-fueled megadrought, and the basin’s major reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are each less than one-third full. 
California’s Colorado River use is on track this year to hit its lowest since 1949. Still, projections show another dry winter may yet send Lake Powell plunging below the levels needed to generate power by December 2026. 
The problem is that even when it rains or snows, runoff is disappearing into thirsty soils before it reaches the river. The paltry runoff keeps driving up estimates of the conservation required to stabilize the basin and its reservoirs. 
Jack Schmidt, director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, and others have urged more urgent conservation in order to protect operations at the dams and ensure that water can be released from Lake Mead and Lake Powell. 
“We continue to drag our heels on not implementing additional cuts right now. That’s our fear: if it doesn’t snow this winter, we’ll really compromise the system,” Schmidt said. “We might get bailed out by a more decent winter, but that’s betting on a whole lot of hope.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/081322-Colorado-River-Water-Drought-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-11 22:58:05.275237

Michael Jackson at midnight Tuesday, taking over as superintendent of the Maryland State Police and kicking off a scramble to fill his District 27 Senate seat which represents parts of three Southern Maryland counties.
The transition marks the end of more than 10 years in the legislature for Jackson, almost five of which have been spent in the Senate. It also marks a return to law enforcement for Jackson, who served as president of the local Fraternal Order of Police from 1997-2002 and as Prince George’s County sheriff from 2002-2010.
“This is bittersweet,” Jackson said Tuesday as he packed up his Senate office — his photo had already been removed from the General Assembly website by Tuesday afternoon.
“There’s much more good work to be done .. always in the public safety arena, particularly with policing,” he said. “I’m proud of the work done as a legislator. I’m going to work hard for the state police. It’s the government police agency that keeps the entire state safe.”
Jackson, 61, takes over for Col. Roland Butler, who retired Nov. 1. Butler became the department’s first Black superintendent when he was sworn in in 2023 — over the objections of Jackson and three other Prince George’s County senators.
Opponents argued during a difficult confirmation battle that Butler had not done enough to promote diversity and address complaints of racism and discriminatory treatment of Black officers during his lengthy career with the agency, including time as chief of the Field Operations Bureau.
The U.S. Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation in 2022 into complaints of discrimination against Black and female applicants in the police agency’s written and physical hiring tests. Last year, the State Police agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle claims by 48 failed police applicants. Even though Justice determined any discrimination was unintentional, the State Police also agreed to revamp hiring tests and offer jobs to at least 25 of the 48 failed applicants.
Since the Maryland case was settled, however, President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has signaled that it intends to walk away from similar suits around the country.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jackson said that as superintendent, he plans a “step-by-step” assessment of the agency that include any lawsuits and other concerns. But he wants troopers to know that he is “not in the head-hunting business. I’m in the service business.”
“We have to be very careful not to make folks who are within the agency working hard every day …being blamed for whatever is going on,” Jackson said Tuesday. “We’re going to address any concerns that are out there. We’re going to make a full assessment.”
To help build relationships and assess resources that may be needed, Jackson would like his former legislative colleagues to visit the 23 state police barracks. He also said he would like to improve on the department’s community engagement, which he said he did during his tenure as Prince George’s County sheriff.
“You’re not going to just see [state troopers] writing tickets on the side of the road, or dealing with accidents, or dealing with Homeland Security matters or intelligence matters,” he said. “You’re going to see us in the community again.”
Musical chairs
Jackson will serve as acting secretary until he can be confirmed by the Senate. But his Senate seat comes open Wednesday.
In the Senate, Jackson served on the Budget and Taxation Committee, where he chaired the Pensions Subcommittee and the Public Safety, Transportation and Environment Subcommittee. Selection of his replacement will include input from each of the three county Democratic Central Committees in the district, Prince George’s, Calvert and Charles counties.
District 27 Dels. Kevin Harris and Jeffrie Long Jr. have so far expressed interest replacing Jackson. Harris represents District 27A, which includes parts of Prince George’s and Charles counties, and Long represents District 27B, which covers parts of Prince George’s and Calvert counties.
It will be up to the three Democratic Central Committees to nominate a replacement for Jackson and send that name to the governor.  They have 30 days after the seat comes open Wednesday to conduct interviews and nominate a replacement.
The Charles County committee has already scheduled a special Nov. 22 public hearing to discuss Jackson’s seat, while Calvert County’s next monthly meeting is set for Nov. 20 online, but it was not clear if the open Senate seat would be on the agenda. Prince George’s central committee usually meets on the third Tuesday of every month, but no meeting date has been posted online as of Tuesday.
According to an Oct. 21 letter from the Maryland Attorney General’s office, each central committee has one vote on the Senate nominee. “If two [central committees] select candidate A and one selects candidate B, the name of candidate A is sent to the Governor,” the letter said, but if each settle on a different candidate, all three names go to the governor, who makes the choice.
Jackson declined to say Tuesday who he supports as his successor, but said he will announce it soon.
“I’m not just going to let that go because they’re representing me, my family and my grandkids,” he said. “I’m hoping that these guys can come to some sort of consensus and figure out who’s going to be the one.”
If Long and Harris remain the only two candidates, Jackson said he’d let the central committees know his choice.
“I’ll say, ‘Hey, I’m leaning toward this one versus the other. I love both of them. They’re both great for the district. I just think right now, it’s better to have this particular one,’” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sen.-Michael-Jackson-10-21-2025-cropped-e1762907420700-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-12 02:58:13.614676

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)More than four months after state lawmakers’ deadline to pass a 2025-2026 budget, a deal may be taking shape at the Capitol in Harrisburg.
Following hours-long meetings of both the House Democratic and Senate Republican caucuses Tuesday evening, reports emerged from multiple sources of a tentative agreement to a $50.1 billion budget, with some details still to be ironed out.
The final price tag is roughly $1.4 billion less than what Gov. Josh Shapiro asked for in his February budget address, and just shy of the $50.3 billion proposal House Democrats passed last month in an attempt to move closer to Republican demands.
Republicans have been firm that they want a budget that will not eat into the state’s $7 billion rainy day fund, while Democrats pushed to increase spending, primarily on education.
Late Tuesday night, the Republican-controlled Senate also convened to advance a handful of code bills directing spending related to education, human services and capital projects. There was no discussion of the contents.

Both the House and Senate are scheduled to meet Wednesday morning.
The movement on the budget came after a long impasse, which appears to have been broken, at least for the moment, in recent discussions between Gov. Josh Shapiro, and top legislative leaders – Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia).
Even a hint that the budget impasse may finally be resolved was welcome news for Pennsylvania counties, school districts and social service providers.
Many that rely on state funding have had to dip into savings or cut spending to make it through the impasse. 
For some organizations that are contracted to provide human service programs funded by the state, it’s meant accepting low-interest loans from state Treasurer Stacy Garrity’s office. It was part of an effort her office established to help social service providers like rape crisis centers and domestic violence survivor support programs continue operating through the deadlock. 
Still, the 4.5% interest on the loans was too much for some service providers. The Senate, however, has passed a bill that would allow the Treasury to forgive the interest on the loans, though the House has yet to act on it.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pennsylvania-Capitol-rotunda--1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-11 22:01:29.790374

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)They may not be in uniform anymore, but the group of veterans that gathered Tuesday at the War Memorial Plaza in Baltimore said they still felt called to serve.
The veterans gathered to rally about President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to send federal troops into the city. They said veterans must again defend democracy, but this time in their own cities.
“Every major step towards justice in this country – freedom, opportunity, equality – was carried forward by men and women who served,” said Bobby LaPin, an Army veteran, local business owner and social media figure. “Now once again, it’s veterans who must stand and defend this nation, not from enemies abroad, but from racism and fascism and corporate corruptions that is growing here at home.
Bobby LaPin, an Army veteran and a Baltimore social media figure, said veterans must fight against the use of federal troops in American cities. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)
“When we raised our right hands and took an oath, it wasn’t to a politician, it wasn’t to a party, it was to the Constitution of the United States,” he said. “That oath did not expire when we took off our uniforms.”
LaPin was one of 10 veterans at the Baltimore demonstration, which was part of a nationwide demonstration called “Vets Say No,” organized by About Face Veterans, a veteran-led anti-war advocacy group.
“It’s a day to send a message,” said Clifford “Buzz” Grambo, a retired chief petty officer of the Navy, at the rally. “We can say it any day, but it’s Veteran’s Day. So obviously it carries a little bit more weight. Hopefully a lot of the civilian world will see it and start speaking out more.”
The “Vets Say No” demonstrations were organized in cities that already have federal troop presence and in cities, like Baltimore, where Trump has threatened to send troops. The administration has already deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
As with other cities where he has deployed, or threatened to deploy, troops,  Trump said he was doing so in response to surging crime in the cities he called crime “hellholes.” Local officials said that not only does Trump not have the authority to order Guard troops into cities, they are not the way to deal with crime and are not welcome.
In Baltimore, both Mayor Brandon Scott and Gov. Wes Moore said there is still work to be done to fight crime, but that rates of gun violence and homicides have fallen sharply. Federal help is welcome, they said, but not a military presence. That was echoed by vets at Tuesday’s rally.
Tim Eppers said a military “occupation” of Baltimore by National Guard troops would not solve the city’s problems. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“The National Guard has an honorable mission – disaster relief, rescue, rebuilding. That service, that protection, that’s what soldiers should do,” said Tim Eppers, a former Army sergeant. “But when they’re deployed in cities like ours, it turns our protectors into enforcers and citizens into suspects.”
Eppers said sending soldiers into Baltimore does not solve problems that the city faces, and resources should instead go into schools and education, mental health services and other programs that support communities.
“The idea of sending a National Guard in cities like Baltimore is wrong. It’s the wrong message, the wrong method and the wrong kind of mission,” Eppers said. “You can’t deploy your way to peace.”
“Every time we send soldiers into our own neighborhoods,” he said, “we’re sending a message, and that message says ‘we don’t trust you. We’ll control you before we’ll take care of you.’ That message destroys the very trust that keeps our communities safe. Baltimore doesn’t need an occupation, it needs opportunity.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_nov11_veteransdays_vetssayno3_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-11 22:01:29.790374
